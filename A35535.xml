            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:104248:3"/> and humbly acknowledge the goodneſs of God in uſing me to doe it, ſuch as it is (I ſay) I freely ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it to your favourable acceptance, &amp; dedicate it to the glory of God &amp; the common good: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is both my duty and Intereſt to ſhew the ſmall improvement though but of one ſingle talent, rather then, either through ſloath or ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh modeſty to hide it in a Napkin.</p>
            <p>In the prefatory Epiſtle to the ſecond part of this book, there was an endeavour of a diſcovery concerning the diſtinct opinion of <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends, as alſo of what himſelfe held faſt and inſiſted upon all along in diſtinction from theirs. And now that I have done with all that was ſaid on both ſides by the diſputants, and am come to open the diſcourſe of <hi>Elihu,</hi> who appeared as <hi>Moderator</hi> to give a determination about the Great Queſtion, ſo long ventitated among them; it may ſeeme ſomewhat neceſſary, and I am much perſwaded (if in any competency attained) it will not be unprofitable, to give The Reader a briefe proſpect of what <hi>Elihu</hi> aymeth at and doth in this his large and accurate diſcourſe, continued in ſixe Chapters throughout and divided into (beſides his Generall preface which takes up the whole thirty ſecond Chapter) foure remarkeable ſections.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:104248:3"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Elihu</hi> is introduced by the pen-man of this booke in a great paſſion, both with <hi>Job</hi> and his three friends, and he gives us an account why he was in ſuch a heate of paſſion with both <hi>(chap: 32.2, 3.) Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu; againſt Job was his wrath kindled, becauſe he had juſtified himſelfe rather then God. Alſo againſt his three friends was his wrath kindled, becauſe they had found no anſwer, and yet had condemned Job.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remaines therefore, that <hi>Elihu</hi> was the man, who found an anſwer in this great difficulty and yet condemned not <hi>Job.</hi> And indeed he condemned him not (as his friends had done) as a man imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect &amp; crooked in his wayes, as a man that feared not God &amp; eſchewed not evill, In or for theſe things <hi>Elihu</hi> did not condemne <hi>Job,</hi> though his wrath was kindled againſt him: he condemned him only for this, becauſe he complained ſo much of the ſeverity of Gods dealings with him, and ſo, by conſequence <hi>juſtified himſelfe rather then God.</hi> And in that poynt or for that fault he ſpared him not, but repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him as ſharply and condemned him as deeply as his friends had done upon other and thoſe (moſt of them) undue and inſufficient grounds. Thus we read his cenſure of him (<hi>chap: 34.35.</hi> Job <hi>hath ſpoken without knowledge, and his words were without wiſdome.</hi> And againe <hi>(chap: 35.16.)
<pb facs="tcp:104248:4"/> Therefore</hi> Job <hi>openeth his mouth in vaine, he multiplyeth</hi> words <hi>without knowledge;</hi> that is, without a cleare knowledge of himſelfe both as a creature and as a ſinner, as alſo of the deſigne and purpoſe of God in afflicting him.</p>
            <p>Now, beſides thoſe paſſages in the diſcourſe of <hi>Elihu</hi> wherein he chargeth <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends with folly for condemning <hi>Job</hi> when they could not anſwer him, &amp; thoſe wherein he reproves <hi>Jobs</hi> ignorance or want of knowledge, for wondring how ſuch great evills ſhould fall upon him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his integrity, likewiſe his boldneſs or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemptorineſs in his own cauſe, juſtifying himſelfe rather then God, yea and deſiring to plead his cauſe before him; I ſay beſides theſe paſſages, we at firſt reading might conclude that <hi>Elihu</hi> did nothing elſe throughout theſe ſix chapters, but enlarge or para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe upon thoſe things, which had long before been ſpoken to by <hi>Eliphaz, Bildad,</hi> and <hi>Zophar,</hi> and by <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe as much as by any of, if not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all them three.</p>
            <p>But upon further conſideration of the matter in the whole ſeries and contexture of his diſcourſe, we may collect two things, inſtanced in and inſiſted on by <hi>Elihu</hi> alone, upon which his particular opinion and ſentence is grounded in diſtinction from all the reſt. The cleare underſtanding of which, will lead
<pb facs="tcp:104248:4"/> us to a faire ſolution or removall of thoſe doubts which ariſe about the queſtion or matter in debate.</p>
            <p>The two diſtinct poynts produced by <hi>Elihu,</hi> are, Firſt, about Revelation, or how God is pleaſed to manifeſt his mind and will to man. Secondly, about Mediation, or the meanes which God hath graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly afforded man to heale thoſe breaches, which ſin hath made between God and him, and ſo either firſtly, or afreſh to reconcile man againe to himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The Former of theſe is handled <hi>(chap: 33. v. 14, 15, 16, 17.) For God ſpeaketh once, yea twice, though man perceiveth it not. In a dream, in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the night, when deepe ſleepe falleth upon men: Then he openeth the eares of men, and ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their inſtruction, that he may withdraw man from his purpoſe, and hide pride from man.</hi> And thus, as it is ſaid in the verſe following, <hi>He keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth back his ſoule from the pit, and his life from periſhing by the ſword;</hi> that is, theſe ſpeakings of God are by the ſaving power and Spirit of God made effectuall for his ſalvation both temporall and eternal.</p>
            <p>The latter is handled in the ſame chapter, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the <hi>23<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
               </hi> verſe to the end of the <hi>30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. If there be a meſſenger (or Angel) with him, an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, one among a thouſand, to ſhew unto man his uprightneſs: then he is gracious unto him, and
<pb facs="tcp:104248:5"/> ſaith, Deliver him from going downe to the pit, I have found a ranſome. His fleſh ſhall be freſher then a childs, he ſhall returne to the dayes of his youth. He ſhall pray unto God, and he will be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to him, and he ſhall ſee his face with joy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Hence the opinion or determination of <hi>Elihu</hi> may be thus conceived.</p>
            <p>That, notwithſtanding all the confuſions and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders which ſeeme to be in the affaires of this world, the providence of God over mankinde in Generall, and his great mercy towards the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in ſpeciall, is ſeene moſt eminently in theſe two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In that he inſpires them with the knowledge of heavenly things, or acquaints them ſome way or other with his mind, both as to the meaning of what he doth to them, and of what he would have them doe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In that he provideth and ſends them a meſſenger or mediatour both to inſtruct them in their duty, &amp; to pray for mercy, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deliver them, <hi>when their ſoule draweth neere to the Grave, and their life to the deſtroyers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both theſe gracious diſpenſations of God are proper to righteous men, or at leaſt appropriate to them in a peculiar manner; the righteous are the
<pb facs="tcp:104248:5"/> men for whom God provides a meſſenger or media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and the righteous are the men whom God ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly and effectually inſpires with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his will, in the things which concerne both their preſent worke and future reward. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath Satan any power ſo to darken their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings about thoſe great things as to make them miſcarry; and as for all his other miſchievous plots and practices againſt them, they ſerve to a cleane contrary purpoſe then he intendeth, according to that moſt comfortable aſſertion of the Apoſtle <hi>(Rom: 8.28.) We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Satan provoked God for a licence to heape out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward calamities upon <hi>Job</hi> in ſtripping him naked of his worldly ſubſtance, and in tormenting his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with grievous paines and ſickneſs; which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Elihu</hi> proſecutes at large <hi>(chap: 33.19, 20, 21, 22.) He is chaſtned alſo with paine upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with ſtrong paine; ſo that his life abhorreth bread,</hi> &amp;c. And what he ſpeakes of ſickneſs is applicable to any or all ſorts of affliction; in all which (as it is ſayd, <hi>v. 27, 28, 29, 30.) God looketh upon men, and if any ſay I have ſinned and perverted that which is right, and it profiteth me not; he will deliver his
<pb facs="tcp:104248:6"/> ſoule from going into the pit, and his life ſhall ſee the light. Lo, all theſe things worketh God oftentimes with man, to bring back his ſoule from the pit, to be enlightned with the light of the living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe premiſes we may collect both what is proper to the righteous; and that, in whatſoever is common to them with the wicked, there is neither diſorder nor confuſion. For though the beſt of the righteous are lyable to the ſame outward evills which the worſt of the wicked are, yet their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not the ſame; ſeeing to the wicked thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills are purely puniſhments, &amp; but the beginning of thoſe ſorrows which ſhall never end; whereas to the righteous they are either but chaſtiſements for ſome ſin already committed, or medicaments to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the committing either of the ſame, or of ſome other ſin. And as for thoſe who by ſuch chaſtnings are brought to a ſight of their ſins and forſake them, <hi>their ſoules are</hi> (by this meanes, <hi>v. 30.) brought back from the pit to be enlightned with the light of the living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This poynt is yet more fully and plainly proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Elihu</hi> in the <hi>36<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> chapter; where he inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, how ſufferings are differently to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of according to a threefold difference of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſuffering. The firſt, and chiefe, is of thoſe, who
<pb facs="tcp:104248:6"/> are truely righteous and keep cloſe to God in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous wayes. The ſecond is of thoſe who being righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in their ſtate have fallen foulely in their way, with whom we may alſo reckon ſuch as are yet in an unrighteous ſtate, yet ſhall be and at laſt are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and brought home to God. The third is of thoſe who perſevere and obſtinately continue in their wicked ſtate and wayes, ſtopping their eares, and hardning their hearts, both againſt inſtruction and correction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elihu</hi> ſeemeth to put all theſe together <hi>(v. 5, 6.) Behold God is mighty and deſpiſeth not any, he is mighty in ſtrength and wiſdome, he preſerveth not the life of the wicked, but giveth right to the poore.</hi> More diſtinctly,</p>
            <p>He ſpeaks of the firſt <hi>(v. 7.) He</hi> (that is, God) <hi>with-draweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne, yea, he doth eſtabliſh them for ever, and they are exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſpeakes of the ſecond ſort <hi>v. 8, 9, 10, 11. And if they be bound in fetters and holden in the cords of affliction, then he ſheweth them their worke and their iniquity, that they have exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He openeth alſo their eare to diſcipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:104248:7"/>
            <p>He ſpeakes of the third ſort <hi>(v. 13, 14.) But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath; they cry not when he bindeth them; they dye in youth, and their life is among the uncleane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe three ſorts of men are dealt with by God according to their kind. The laſt of them being altogether wicked and incorrigible, abide under wrath for ever.</p>
            <p>The ſecond being in an evill ſtate or having done that which is evill, yet humbling themſelves (through grace) and being bettered by their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are uſually reſtored to a proſperous eſtate in this life, &amp; in caſe they dy under affliction, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes crowned with the bleſſedneſs of eternal life.</p>
            <p>The Firſt ſort, walking conſtantly (humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties excepted) in their uprightneſſe, are not only preſerved in peace, but receive high favours and ſpeciall markes of honour from the bountifull hand of God; which is true, eſpecially according to the condition of thoſe times, wherein God did more engage himſelfe to his faithfull ſervants in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of temporall happineſs, then now he doth in Goſpel times.</p>
            <p>And yet even theſe, as now they are not, ſo then they were not alwayes exempted from ſufferings; For as the ſecond ſort of righteous men are often afflicted in a way of chaſtiſement for their ſins;
<pb facs="tcp:104248:7"/> ſo the Lord reſerves to himſelfe a liberty (his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty allowing it) to afflict the beſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest of his ſervants for the tryall of their graces, or the magnifying of his owne grace to them and in them; as <hi>a Maſter of Heroick Arts and Games</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a very laborious task upon his <hi>Schollar-Champion,</hi> not as a puniſhment of any default, but to confirme his ſtrength and exerciſe his valour.</p>
            <p>The due conſideration of all theſe things layd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by <hi>Elihu,</hi> might well ſatisfie <hi>Job,</hi> and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine his faith in a patient bearing the burden of all thoſe calamities, which the Great and moſt wiſe God was pleaſed to impoſe upon him, and likewiſe convince him that he had fayled much in giving out ſo many impatient complaints about them. And no doubt they prevailed much with him, both towards his conviction, and the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his heart under thoſe diſpenſations; For we heare no more of him in that language.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Elihu</hi> thought he had not done enough, but continueth his diſcourſe, and draweth a further demonſtration for his purpoſe, from the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full workes of God in nature, from the raine, thunder, ſnow, windes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he doth from the <hi>27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> verſe of the <hi>36<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> Chapter, to the end of the <hi>37<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,</hi> and with that concludes his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:104248:8"/>
            <p>The ſcope of <hi>Elihu</hi> in that long and learned Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall Lecture was to teach and aſſure <hi>Job,</hi> that, God who cauſeth and diſpoſeth thoſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous alterations and terrible impreſſions in the ayre, both for the humbling and benefiting of man, doth much more both ſend and over-rule all thoſe chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges &amp; afflictions which befall the ſons of men, here on earth, to humble them &amp; do them good. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to aſſure him, that if man be not able to give a ſatisfying reaſon of thoſe workes of God in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but is often gravel'd and forced to ſit downe in a ſilent admiration; then ſurely man is much leſſe able to fathome the depth of Gods purpoſes in all the workes of his providence, but muſt in many of them only ſit downe quietly and ſubmit; For (as <hi>Elihu</hi> concludeth from theſe premiſes <hi>(Chap: 37.23, 24.) Touching the Almighty we cannot find him out, he is Excellent in power and in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in plenty of Juſtice he will not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,</hi> (either cauſeleſly or more then needs, though we ſeldome ſee the cauſes or acknowledge the need of his afflictions) <hi>men doe</hi> (that is, they ought) <hi>therefore feare him;</hi> and if any are ſo proud and high in their owne thoughts that they doe not, at their perill be it, for) <hi>he reſpecteth not any that are wiſe in heart;</hi> that is, as the carnal wiſdome of worldly men cannot be a barre,
<pb facs="tcp:104248:8"/> ſo the true wiſdome of godly men is no privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge againſt the Soveraigne power of God in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting them. And therefore <hi>Job,</hi> though truely wiſe in heart, muſt not looke for any ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect from God as to be untoucht by or priviledg'd from affliction.</p>
            <p>For the cloſe of all, we may ſumme up the whole ſcope of <hi>Elihu's</hi> under-taking with <hi>Job,</hi> yea of the whole Booke of <hi>Job</hi> in theſe ſix poynts or propoſitions.</p>
            <p>First, No man can ſtand before God in his owne perſonall righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, How righteous ſoever any perſon is, yet the Lord may afflict and breake him in what way and in what degree himſelfe thinkes fit.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God hath moſt wiſe and gracious aymes in afflicting his righteous ſervants.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, His most righteous ſervants may not take the liberty to complaine as if they were wrong'd, or as if God were either rigorous or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous in the leaſt, how much or how long ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are afflicted.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, There is nothing gotten by complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſtriving under the afflicting hand of God; and therefore.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, 'Tis best for us or our wiſest way
<pb facs="tcp:104248:9"/> when things are at worst with us to give glory to God both as just and good, and (poſſeſſing our ſoules with patience) by faith to waite in hope, till he giveth us a freſh experience of his goodneſſe, eyther by ſweetning our troubles to us, and ſupporting us under them, or by bringing us out of them (as he did Job) in the fittest ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>If in peruſing this diſcourſe of <hi>Elihu</hi> we carry theſe generall reſults in our eye, we ſhall read both the Text and Comment with more cleareneſſe in our underſtandings at all times, and with more profit (when at any time under them) in our chaſtenings, which, that we all may is the prayer of</p>

               <p>In the firſt part, he directeth his ſpeech; firſt to <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends, in this 32<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Chapter; Secondly, to <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe in the 33<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>In this Chapter we may conſider, firſt a rationall tranſition from the diſpute between <hi>Job</hi> and his friends, to this diſcourſe of <hi>Elihu,</hi> in the five firſt verſes; Secondly, we have a very Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or patheticall Preface, wherein <hi>Elihu</hi> endeavoureth to gaine attention by giving an account, or the reaſons of his undertaking, in which he interweaves many Apologies for himſelfe, in ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon ſo hard a taske, reſpecting both his youth, and the weight of the argument.

               <p>Yet more diſtinctly in this firſt part, The tranſition; firſt, a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is aſſigned why <hi>Jobs</hi> friends left off ſpeaking. <hi>As it is not good to begin to ſpeak, ſo neither to give over ſpeaking, till we ſee and can give a reaſon for it;</hi> The reaſon here given, is, becauſe <hi>Job was righteous in his own eyes</hi> (v. 1.) Secondly, a reaſon is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven not only why <hi>Elihu</hi> did begin to ſpeak, but why he began to ſpeak as he did, <hi>in anger;</hi> firſt, againſt <hi>Job,</hi> which is laid downe in the ſecond verſe, <hi>Becauſe he juſtified himſelfe rather then God;</hi> Secondly, againſt his friends (<hi>ver.</hi> 3.) <hi>Becauſe they had found no anſwer, yet had condemned Job,</hi> or, <hi>becauſe they cenſured him, though they could not confute him.</hi> In the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſes, we have a diſcovery of the cauſe of <hi>Elihu's</hi> modeſty in forbearing ſo long to ſpeak, which he further inlargeth in the following parts of the Chapter.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>We may yet further enquire, why did they ceaſe? Firſt, ſome men ceaſe to anſwer, becauſe they have no more to anſwer. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, others ceaſe to anſwer, becauſe they ſuppoſe they have anſwered enough already, and will anſwer no more. Some ſay the former was the reaſon why <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends ceaſed to anſwer, they had no more to anſwer; Others take the latter, that they had no mind, no will to give any further anſwer. But the reaſon expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the text (which ſhould ſatisfie us and ſuperſeed further queries) is,
<q>Becauſe he was righteous in his owne eyes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As if it had been ſaid, <hi>Becauſe they ſaw they had done no good upon him, Job kept his ground and maintained his ſtanding, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted every inch with them, and yeilded not an inch; as they found him at firſt, ſo he was at laſt, they ſaw him a man immoveably ſet downe in his owne purpoſe and opinion, and therefore, becauſe they could get nothing by ſpeaking, they would ſpeak no more. 'Tis but lost labour,</hi> (as we ſay) <hi>to waſh the Blackmore.</hi> The conſtancy and warmth of <hi>Job</hi> in defending himſelfe they judged obſtinacy and a humour to oppoſe, or but the ſwelling of a proud ſpirit; whereas indeed it was the love of truth, not of contention, a zeale to doe himſelfe right, not to doe them wrong, which cauſed him ſtill to hold up the Bucklers, and adhere ſo ſtiffely to his owne opinion. Thus deſpayring to convince or bring him to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement; that he was unrighteous, <hi>they ceaſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Becauſe he was righteous in his owne eyes.</q>
                  <p>That's ſuch another forme of ſpeaking (<hi>Pro.</hi> 3.7.) <hi>Be not wiſe in thine owne eyes;</hi> As alſo that (<hi>Pro.</hi> 26.12.) <hi>Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit, there is more hope of a fool then of him.</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:104248:11"/> You may eaſier reduce a man that is indeed ignorant, then him, that thinks himſelfe very wiſe, or knowing, but is not. This was the apprehenſion of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends concerning him, <hi>He was a man</hi> (thought they and ſo they ſaid) <hi>righteous in his owne eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are three ſorts of righteous perſons. Firſt, ſuch as are righteous in the eyes of God, and ſo the Godly are under a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold notion; Firſt, as being pardoned for or juſtified from their unrighteouſneſſe, through faith in Chriſt; Bleſſed are they who are thus accounted righteous in the eyes of God. Secondly, they are righteous, as avoyding unrighteous, and doing righteous things. There is a ſeed a principle of righteouſneſſe in perſons juſtified and regenerated, which dayly puts it ſelfe forth in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous actings; <hi>He that doth righteouſneſſe is righteous</hi> (1 Joh: 3.7.) He is ſo, both as to his ſtate, and as to his actions, in the eyes of God and good men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Many are righteous in the eyes of men, they have faire appearances and out-ſides; you can read nothing amiſſe in their converſation, yet they are unrighteous, yea altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous in the eyes of God, yea and poſſibly in their owne too; They cannot but ſee their own wickedneſſe, though they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it from the ſight of others. Hypocrites are like painted Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers, faire without (as Chriſt ſpake of the Phariſees) but within full of rottenneſſe. They ſeeme that to men which God ſeeth they are not; They can ſhew their beſt ſide to and hide their worſt from men, but they cannot play this game with God; he ſeeth their beſt is bad, becauſe it is but the covering, not the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, not the mortifying of that which is bad.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is another ſort who are righteous in their own eyes; ſuch <hi>Solomon</hi> deſcribes (<hi>Prov.</hi> 30.12.) <hi>There is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that are pure in their owne eyes, and yet is not waſhed from their filthineſſe.</hi> Theſe have a great opinion of themſelves; They think all is right and well with them, when indeed they are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and uncleane, their hearts being yet unchanged, though their wayes are ſmoothed; and though they may have left off to doe many filthy things, yet they are not waſhed from their filthineſſe. The text in hand puts <hi>Job</hi> into this third ſort of righteous men. But was it thus with him? I anſwer; Firſt, <hi>Job</hi> was a man righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in the eyes of God, in both the notions mentioned; he was righteous as juſtified and righteous as ſanctified. Secondly,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104248:11"/> 
                     <hi>Job</hi> was a man righteous in the eyes of many men; for he ſaith (<hi>Chap.</hi> 29.11.) <hi>The ear which heard me bleſſed me, and the eye which ſaw me gave witneſſe to me;</hi> yet <hi>Job</hi> had not an univerſall teſtimony given by men; There were ſome, I cannot ſay many, in whoſe eyes he was unrighteous; He was ſo in the eyes and opinion of his friends eſpecially. Though none could, as to the eye, tax <hi>Job</hi> with any unrighteouſneſſe, no not they who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe had ſifted his life to the bran, yet his friends thought him unrighteous, and he ſtood judg'd as unrighteous in their eye.</p>
                  <p>As for the third ſort of righteouſneſſe, that of being righteous in our owne eyes we muſt diſtinguiſh; <hi>Job</hi> was indeed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his owne eyes in a good ſence, and that under a twofold conſideration; Firſt, as not having committed any groſs or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous act of wickedneſſe, as he profeſſed at large and with much confidence in that apologie and vindication which he made for himſelfe in the Chapter foregoing; where he calls downe the ſevereſt judgements of God upon himſelfe, if he had done ſuch things as he was ſuſpected of, eſpecially if he had defiled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with thoſe common polutions of the world, wantonneſſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and oppreſſion. <hi>Job</hi> ſtood upon it that he was thus righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Secondly, <hi>Job</hi> was righteous in his owne eyes, as to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of himſelfe in any the leaſt ſin or unevenneſſe, either of heart or life; Thus much his proteſtation or imprecation amounts to in the 33<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe of that Chapter; <hi>If I have covered my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my boſome;</hi> As if he had ſaid, I have not lived in the love of any ſin whatſoever. Thus <hi>Job</hi> was righteous in his owne eyes, proteſting to God and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, that as he was not ſcandalouſly wicked in any kinde, ſo he was not cloſely nor hypocritically wicked; every ſin was his burden, and the abhorrence of his ſoule. In any other ſence <hi>Job</hi> was far from being righteous in his owne eyes; He never either ſaid or thought he had done no evill, or was altogether ſin-leſſe, like white paper without blot or blur; yea we very often find him confeſſing his ſins and failings (<hi>Chap.</hi> 7.20.) <hi>I have ſinned; what ſhall I doe unto thee thou preſerver of men?</hi> He maketh a like acknowledgement (<hi>Chap.</hi> 9.2.) <hi>I know it is ſo of a truth, but how ſhall man be juſt with God? If he will contend with him, he cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand.</hi> Againe (<hi>ver.</hi> 20.) <hi>If I ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie my ſelfe, my mouth ſhall condemne me: If I ſay I am perfect,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104248:12"/> it ſhall alſo prove me perverſe.</hi> And while he affirmes the generall viciouſneſſe of nature, he muſt needs imply his owne (<hi>Chap.</hi> 15.14.) <hi>What is man that he ſhould be cleane? and he which is, borne of a woman, that he ſhould be righteous? Behold he putteth no truſt in his Saints, yea the heavens are not cleane in his ſight, how much more abominable and filthy is man?</hi> In this univerſall concluſion, he includeth himſelfe, therefore <hi>Job</hi> was far from being righteous in his owne eyes in any proud opinion of his owne righteouſneſſe or freedome from any ſtaine of ſin.

And though nothing be impoſſible unto God, yet we find God himſelfe giving over both ſpeaking and ſmiting when he ſeeth he is like to doe no good by eyther. Thus he expreſſeth his purpoſe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5.) when he had ſpent many rods of ſore Judgements &amp; afflictions upon that people, when he had ſtricken them till, from the crowne of the head, to the ſole of the feete, they were nothing but a continued wound, and yet they received not correction; he preſently reaſons thus, <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more, ye will revolt more and more.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>The end why I ſmote you was to amend you, to bring you home to my ſelfe, to cauſe you to turne back, or returne from your evill wayes, but I ſee I have lost my labour, and ſpent not only my rods but my ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions in vaine upon you, therefore I will ceaſe from this kind of work, why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more, ye will revolt more and more.</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:104248:12"/> And when God hath ſpoken long to a people who regard it not, he ceaſeth to ſpeak any more, but ſaith, Why ſhould ye be taught any more? Let the Prophets tongue cleave to the roof of his mouth, let him be dumb and ſilent, as the word is (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.26.) <hi>Thou ſhalt be dumb, and ſhalt not be a reprover</hi> (why) <hi>for they are a rebellious houſe.</hi> After all thy ſpeaking, they continue rebelling, therefore ſpeak no more. We read the like dreadfull prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (<hi>Hoſ:</hi> 4.4.) <hi>Let no man ſtrive nor reprove another</hi> (let all wayes of reclaiming this people be laid aſide) <hi>For thy people are as they that ſtrive with the Prieſt;</hi> That is, they are obdurate and deſperately ingaged in wickedneſſe (<hi>Hoſ:</hi> 4.17.) <hi>Ephraim is joyned to Idols</hi> (he cleaveth and ſticketh faſt to them, he will not be pulled from his owne inventions) <hi>Let him alone.</hi> Thus God ſaith to his Prophets and Miniſters, <hi>ceaſe,</hi> he ſaith to his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>ceaſe,</hi> when ſinners will not ceaſe to ſin and doe wickedly againſt the Lord. The ſame unprofitable and incorrigible people are threatned in the ſame manner by another Prophet (<hi>Amos</hi> 8.9.) <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe in that day, ſaith the Lord God, that I will cauſe the Sun to goe downe at noone.</hi> And (<hi>ver.</hi> 11.) <hi>I will ſend a famine in the Land, not a famine of bread, but of hearing the words of the Lord.</hi> God would ſtop the raining down of heavenly Manna, and the people ſhould not heare, becauſe they would not. Such was the ſentence of Chriſt againſt the <hi>Jewes</hi> (Math. 23.37.) <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtonest them which are ſent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye would not?</hi> What follows this refuſall? read and tremble (<hi>ver.</hi> 38.) <hi>Behold your houſe is left unto you deſolate, for I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, ye ſhall not ſee me henceforth,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, becauſe ye have been ſo unteachable, therefore ye ſhall be taught no more. It is ſad, when we give God occaſion to give over either ſpeaking to us or afflicting us. God will not alwayes ſtrive with the unwillingneſſe, much leſſe with the wilfulneſſe of man; nor will men be alwayes doing that to men, which they ſee doth them no good. <hi>So theſe three men ceaſed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note hence;
<q>When men are obſtinate and will not be reclaimed, it is good to give over.</q>

                  <p>Why ſhould they who in any kind are abſolutely reſolved, be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104248:13"/> further moved? (<hi>Acts</hi> 21.14.) <hi>When Pauls friends ſaw he would not be perſwaded, they ceaſed:</hi> they had uſed much perſwaſion to keepe him from going up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe of the ſufferings that were propheſied ſhould befall him there, yet when he ſtood out, in an holy obſtinacy againſt them, cloathed with a gracious ſpirit of courage to ſuffer for Chriſt; <hi>When he would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded they ceaſed, ſaying, the will of the Lord be done.</hi> As it was the height of <hi>Pauls</hi> holineſs that he would not be perſwaded, he was obſtinate for Gods cauſe, or for the doing of a duty; ſo it is the height of many mens wickedneſſe that they will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, they are obſtinate againſt God, or againſt the doing of their duty; Such as are infected with the luſt of contending, will maintaine that opinion pertinaciouſly, which they cannot maintaine truely. As ſome ſtrive for the love of victory, rather then of truth; ſo others ſtrive becauſe they love ſtrife even more then victory, and had rather contend then conquer, becauſe that puts an end to ſtrife. In ſuch caſes they doe beſt who doe no more; And if <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe had been ſuch, if he had held up the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, not for truth but for victory, or becauſe he would have the laſt word, like a clamorous Sophiſter, who hath alwayes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to ſay, though nothing to the purpoſe; In that caſe, I ſay, <hi>Jobs</hi> friends had done wiſely in ceaſing to anſwer; They indeed did well upon their owne ſuppoſition, though as to the truth of <hi>Jobs</hi> condition they failed greatly. <hi>Job</hi> was not a man of that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he that perſiſts in holding and defending truth, is not obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate but conſtant.</p>
                  <p>Further, as to the ground why they ceaſed, according to their ſuppoſition,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>To be righteous in our owne eyes is hatefull both to God and good men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man is never ſo vile in the eyes of thoſe who can diſcerne him, as when he is righteous in his owne; how righteous ſoever any man is, he ſhould be little in owning it. To inſiſt much upon our owne righteouſneſſe, ſavours rankly of a Phariſee (<hi>Luke</hi> 18.9.) Chriſt ſpake a parable to this purpoſe (that's the title of the Parable) (<hi>ver.</hi> 9.) <hi>And he ſpake this parable unto certain which truſted in themſelves that they were righteous, and deſpiſed others.</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:104248:13"/> Then follows the Phariſees boaſt of his faſting twice in the weeke, &amp;c. And when the text ſaith (<hi>ver.</hi> 14.) <hi>the Publican went downe to his houſe juſtified rather then the other.</hi> It doth not imply that the Phariſee was at all juſtified, but rather that being righteous in his owne eyes, he was under a ſad ſentence of condemnation in the eyes of God. The meaning is not that the Phariſee was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what juſtified, and the Publican more; But that the Phariſee was not juſtified at all. It is our duty to follow after righteouſneſſe, but our ſin to boaſt of it (<hi>Math.</hi> 5.3.) <hi>Bleſſed are the poore in ſpirit. The more poore we are in ſpirit, the more rich we are in ſpiritualls.</hi> Poverty of ſpirit is directly oppoſite to our being righteous in our owne eyes. <hi>Chriſt came not to call the righteous but ſinners to repentance.</hi> (Math. 9.13.) By the righteous there we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thoſe that are righteous in their owne eyes, thoſe that have high thoughts of themſelves; The ſinners whom Chriſt calls to repentance are the poore in ſpirit, though indeed the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their owne eyes, are the greateſt ſinners. As we never doe worſe, or more againſt right, then when we doe that (as it was ſaid of that ungovern'd age, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17.6.) which is right in our own eyes, ſo we are never worſe, then when we are righteous in our owne eyes.</p>
                  <p>From the whole matter of theſe words, we ſee, that as <hi>Jobs</hi> friends had been miſtaken all along in that which they ſpake, ſo now in the reaſon of their ceaſing to ſpeake; which was a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall that <hi>Job</hi> was righteous in his owne eyes.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>There is nothing more common then for men to miſtake and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge one another.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jobs</hi> friends concluded him ſetled in a proud conceit of his owne righteouſneſſe, becauſe he conſtantly denyed their charge of unrighteouſneſſe. Some impoſe an opinion upon their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren which is not theirs, and make them ſay that which they doe not affirme; how injurious is this! yea ſome miſ-judge the word of God, as well as the words of men. They wreſt the Scriptures, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.) They make the Scripture ſpeake that, which the holy Ghoſt never intended. It is dangerous to ſtraine the word of a man, much more the word of God. The former proceeds from a want of charity, but the latter is a great impiety. There
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104248:14"/> could not be a more unrighteous thought conceived of <hi>Job</hi> in any mans heart, then that he was (as his friends thought him) righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in his owne eyes; yet thus they thought him, nor would they thinke otherwiſe of him, let him ſay what he would to the contrary. So much of the firſt verſe which giveth us a reaſon why <hi>Jobs</hi> friends ſate downe and ceaſed to anſwer; His being (as they judged him) righteous in his owne eyes. In the next verſe <hi>Elihu</hi> gives out a ſeverer Judgement againſt him then this; To be at all righteous in our owne eyes (according to the ſence intended) argues a man to be both very blind and very proud, but for a man to be ſo righteous in his owne eyes, as that he dares juſtifie himſelfe rather then the moſt righteous God, argues not only blindneſſe and pride, but pride and blaſphemy; yet thus ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi> as it followeth.</p>

                     <hi>Of the kindred of Ram,</hi> of the family or poſterity of <hi>Ram.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Who this <hi>Ram</hi> was is much controverted by Interpreters; nor is the controverſie yet ended who this <hi>Ram</hi> was. Some ſay he was that <hi>Ram</hi> ſpoken of (<hi>Ruth</hi> 4.19.) But it is not likely, that he was ſo ancient as <hi>Job,</hi> or if he were, he would not leave the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> (from whom <hi>Pharez</hi> was deſcended) to dwell among the <hi>Edomites.</hi> Others ſay he was that <hi>Aram</hi> mentioned (<hi>Gen:</hi> 22.21.) But neither doth this appeare true; for then <hi>Elihu</hi> could not be a <hi>Buzite,</hi> but muſt draw his line from <hi>Kemuel</hi> the brother of <hi>Buz.</hi> The Chaldee Paraphraſe tells us, he was <hi>Abraham.</hi> And to cleare this 'tis ſaid (as our owne learned Annotators have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it) that he had a threefold gradation in his name; Firſt, he was called only <hi>Ram,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>high;</hi> Secondly, <hi>Abram,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>A high father;</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Abraham,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <hi>the high father of a multitude.</hi> But, upon which to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine I conceive it impoſſible, nor is there any great matter in it. Only this ſeemes cleare, that the family of <hi>Ram</hi> was ſome great and illuſtrious family in thoſe times; and we may take notice how diſtinct and punctuall the penman of this book was in deſcribing the pedegree of <hi>Elihu.</hi> And there may be two reaſons why the Spirit of God directed him to be ſo; Firſt, becauſe he was but a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104248:16"/> young man;<note place="margin">Neutrae ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae accederom, ſed <hi>Ram</hi> alium quempiam fuiſſe putarim virum celebrem et cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ex familia Nahor. <hi>Merc:</hi>
                     </note> And therefore as <hi>Saul</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.56.) when he ſaw <hi>David</hi> a young man, he asked after his parentage; <hi>Enquire whoſe Son this ſtripling is;</hi> I would faine know his kindred. So the kindred of <hi>Elihu</hi> is thus diſtinctly ſet downe, that he who by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his youth was little knowne as to his perſon, might be the better knowne by his Anceſtors, or parentage.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, His parentage is thus diſtinctly ſet downe, to aſſure us, that this is a true hiſtory; For ſome have made the whole booke of <hi>Job</hi> to be but a parable, aſſerting there was no ſuch reall thing. But this one paſſage gives an undeniable proofe, that this was a reall hiſtory, and the matter really acted. This perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſcribed by his owne name and his fathers name, and the next of his kindred.</p>
                  <p>From the conſideration of the perſon who carried on ſo great a part in this buſineſſe, <hi>Elihu, the ſon of Barachel the Buzite of the kindred of Ram,</hi> who was of a ſtrange Country, and if allyed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet at a great diſtance; we may obſerve;
<q>God did preſerve a ſeed of religion, and of holy men to maintaine his truth among thoſe who lived in darke places, and were wrapt up in many errors and ſuperſtitions.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was alſo noted from the firſt words of this booke, <hi>There was a man in the Land of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z;</hi> A man of gracious accompliſhments and of a heavenly light. Here alſo was <hi>Elihu</hi> the <hi>Buzite,</hi> A man that had great knowledge about holy things (as we ſhall ſee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards) in thoſe parts and times when and where abundance of darkneſſe, blindneſſe and ignorance reigned.</p>
                  <p>Having thus deſcribed <hi>Elihu;</hi> The hiſtory proceeds.</p>
                  <q>Against Job was his wrath kindled, becauſe he juſtified himſelfe rather then God.</q>
                  <p>In the former part of the verſe it is ſaid; <hi>Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu;</hi> Not ſpecifying againſt whom, nor the cauſe why; here he doubles the ſame words, with an addition, firſt, of the perſon with whom he was angry; <hi>Againſt Job was his wrath kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> And as he tells us the marke or object of his wrath; ſo he gives, ſecondly, the reaſon of it; <hi>Becauſe he juſtified himſelf rather then God.</hi> Before I come to the explication of this latter branch, take theſe two brief notes.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:104248:16"/>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> A godly man in maintaining a good cauſe, may give juſt reaſon of anothers paſſion or anger.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> was a good man, and his cauſe was good, yet you ſee a wiſe and a good mans wrath is kindled. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were two good men, yet a difference aroſe between them (<hi>Acts</hi> 15.39.) <hi>And the contention was ſo ſharp between them that they departed aſunder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſidering the cauſe of this anger in generall, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he juſtified himſelfe rather then God;</hi> we ſee it was an anger for Gods cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Anger for God or in the cauſe of God is holy anger.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though for the moſt part the fleſh or our carnall corruption is the cauſe of anger, and it begins at ſelfe; yet ſometimes it is ſtirr'd in the cauſe of God. It is ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the meekeſt man on earth (<hi>Numb.</hi> 12.3.) that when he ſaw the idolatry of the people (<hi>Exod.</hi> 32.19.) <hi>His anger waxed hot;</hi> He was ſo angry that he caſt the Tables of the Law which God had written with his own hand, out of his hand and broke them. It is ſaid (<hi>Mar.</hi> 3.5.) <hi>Jeſus Chriſt looked about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardneſſe of their hearts;</hi> He alſo expreſt a great deale of zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous anger (<hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15.) <hi>When he made a whip of ſmall cords, and drove the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple.</hi>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104248:17"/> Gourd; is an argument of undue love to ſelfe. When God ſpared <hi>Nineveh</hi> the Prophet was exceeding angry (<hi>Jon.</hi> 4.1.) But his was ſinfull anger; becauſe he was angry for his owne ſake, fearing to be called a falſe Prophet; He ſet himſelfe downe to ſee what would become of the City, that he might have a perſonall glory, and be cryed up for a Prophet indeed. And when God had ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his Gourd, he was angry and angry <hi>unto the death</hi> (ver. 8.) and all becauſe he miſſed that which pleaſed himſelfe. Many can be angry when they themſelves are diſcredited, but when diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is caſt upon God, or his intereſt ſlighted, how quiet and tame, how cold and dull are their ſpirits! The anger of this man was a noble anger, as to the occaſion and riſe of it, <hi>Jobs</hi> ſelfe-ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, or
<q>Becauſe he juſtified himſelfe rather then God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a high poynt, and may juſtly provoke our anger, <hi>Elihu</hi> was not angry with <hi>Job</hi> becauſe he juſtified himſelfe againſt his friends, but becauſe he juſtified himſelfe rather then God.</p>
                  <p>Here a queſtion will ariſe, and it will ask ſome paines to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it; Was this true? did <hi>Job</hi> juſtifie himſelfe rather then God? Was it poſſible <hi>Job</hi> ſhould do ſo? I ſhall give only a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall anſwer to this queſtion; <hi>Job</hi> did not juſtifie himſelf rather then God, either explicitely, or intentionally, but by conſequents he did. And though it be granted that <hi>Job</hi> gave juſt occaſion of this ſharp reproofe by his raſh and paſſionate ſpeeches, uttered in the heate of diſpute, and in the grief of his heart, yet it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that <hi>Elihu</hi> did ſomewhat ſtrain <hi>Jobs</hi> words, though not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their ſence, yet beyond his ſence, and gave them the hardeſt interpretation (ſomewhat beſide the rule of charity) which they could beare, nor did he obſerve that meekneſſe and moderation which might well have become him, to a man in that caſe. <hi>O how hard is it not to offend or doe ill, while we are doing well!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To cleare this a little further conſider, There is a twofold ſtraining of words; Firſt, beyond the ſence of the words ſpoken; Secondly, beyond the ſence of the ſpeaker. I doe not ſay <hi>Elihu</hi> in affirming this of <hi>Job,</hi> ſtrained his words beyond their ſence, but he ſtrained them beyond <hi>Jobs</hi> ſence. <hi>Job</hi> ſpake words which might lay him under this cenſure, that he juſtified himſelfe rather then God; But this was far from his intention; For doubtleſſe he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104248:17"/> had rather a thouſand times his tongue ſhould have been cut out of his mouth, then to juſtifie himſelfe with it rather then God, or to ſpeak a word to the diſparagement of Gods Juſtice. So then it was hard for <hi>Elihu</hi> to charge <hi>Job</hi> thus, though <hi>Job</hi> had let fall ſome inconſiderate ſpeeches, which adminiſtred occaſion for ſuch a charge. And as one of the Ancients ſpeakes of difficulties and ſeeming contradictions in Scripture; <hi>Diſtinguiſh the times, and the Scriptures will accord;</hi> So diſtinguiſh the time of this diſpute, take <hi>Job</hi> at the beginning of it, before he was teazed and heated by his friends, and then he ſpake at a very low rate of himſelfe; <hi>If I were righteous I would not know my owne ſoule.</hi> But in the heat and towards the later end of this long diſpute, <hi>Job</hi> gave too much advantage for ſuch a conſtruction to be put upon his words, that <hi>he juſtified himſelfe rather then God;</hi> then which nothing can be ſaid more unjuſtifiable, nor more reproveable.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>To juſtifie our ſelves doth uſually and juſtly lay us open to the reproofe of others; <hi>or,</hi> To juſtifie our ſelves, drawes blame upon our ſelves.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To juſtifie,</hi> is foure wayes uſed in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, (which is the moſt remarkable and excellent act of it) God juſtifieth man (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33.) <hi>It is God that juſtifieth.</hi> This act of divine Grace conſiſts in two things; Firſt, in the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſts righteouſneſſe to us; Secondly, in the free remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſins.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Man juſtifieth God (<hi>Luk.</hi> 7.29, 30.) <hi>And all the people that heard him, and the Publicans juſtified God, being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with the Baptiſme of John.</hi> Where to juſtifie imports as much as to Glorifie doth, (<hi>Acts</hi> 13.48.) <hi>And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord;</hi> That is, they readily approved and received the word of the Lord; when we approve the Doctrine, and doings of God, his word and works, then we juſtifie him. And how ready ſhould we be on all occaſions to juſtifie God, who only is and is altogether good, when he is ſo graciouſly ready to juſtifie us who are evill, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evill and ungodly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We read in Scripture of man juſtifying man, which is done any of theſe three wayes.</p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:104248:18"/>
                  <p>Firſt, He that conſents to what another hath done (though the deed be evill) juſtifieth him in doing it. A ſecret liking of any mans action is (as much as that amounts to) the juſtification of his perſon.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He that openly approveth or applaudeth what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath done, juſtifieth him much more. To conſent with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is ſinfull, to flatter them in their ſin is abominable.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He that ſtands up to maintaine and defend what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath done, juſtifies him moſt of all. All theſe acts of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <hi>Job</hi> denied his friends, while he ſaid (<hi>Chap.</hi> 27.5.) <hi>God forbid I ſhould juſtifie you;</hi> That is, that I ſhould ſecretly conſent to or openly approve and maintaine what you have ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, or you in ſaying it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The ſame man is ſaid to juſtifie himſelfe; this ſelfe-juſtification is that which kindled the wrath of <hi>Elihu</hi> againſt <hi>Job;</hi> The text is expreſſe; <hi>Becauſe he juſtified himſelfe,</hi> &amp;c. This juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our ſelves is of two ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Internall and mentall; when in our hearts we give ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for, or approve of our ſelves; when we inwardly boaſt and glory of our ſelves, whether in what we are, or in what we doe and affirme. The Phariſee (<hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11.) <hi>ſtood and prayed thus with himſelfe</hi> (or to himſelfe, that is, ſilently) <hi>God I thanke thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this Publicane; I faſt twice in the weeke,</hi> &amp;c. Thus he juſtified himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is an externall and vocall ſelfe-juſtification, when we openly commend, and cry up our ſelves; Thus <hi>Jehu</hi> ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified himſelfe (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.16.) <hi>Come ſee my zeale for the Lord;</hi> He would needs blow a trumpet, and proclaime before all men how good a man he was, and what good he had done.</p>
                  <p>Yet further, the juſtification of our ſelves is two-fold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Lawfull, yea and commendable; Take that in two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That man who is really and indeed in a juſtified ſtate, through the free grace of God in Chriſt, he, when a juſt occaſion is offered, may juſtifie himſelfe declaratively before men; For as we ought alwayes to juſtifie our ſelves declaratively by our works, that is, give evidence by our workes that we are juſtified by faith; ſo we may juſtifie our ſelves by our words, to magnifie
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104248:18"/> the rich grace of God in juſtifying us freely through Chriſt. <hi>David</hi> called others to take notice of what God had done for his ſoule, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.16.) Thus a beleever may lawfully at any time, and at all times, it is his duty to juſtifie himſelfe before men, by giving as the Apoſtle directs (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15.) <hi>an anſwer to every one that asketh a reaſon of the hope that is in him,</hi> (that is, of his juſtified ſtate) <hi>with meekneſs and feare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, A man that is ſound at heart, honeſt and upright with God, may lawfully juſtifie himſelfe, as to the integrity of his intentions, purpoſes, and deſignes, when he falls under other mens jealouſies and ſuſpicions. <hi>David</hi> being often unjuſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by <hi>Saul,</hi> was as often in this worke of juſtifying himſelfe againſt him, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.8.) <hi>Judge me, O Lord, according to my righteouſneſſe, and according to mine integrity that is in me;</hi> As if he had ſaid, I am judged unrighteouſly, but I appeale to thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgement, who fully knoweſt (which I alſo know, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience bearing witneſs) mine integrity. I appeale to thy mercy for the many ſins which I have committed againſt thy ſelfe, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> I appeale to thy Juſtice whether (as I am accuſed) I have at all ſinned againſt <hi>Saul.</hi> We may reade <hi>Paul</hi> doing the ſame at large while he profeſſed (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3, 4.) that he did not act upon covetous deſignes for himſelfe, nor was a flatterer of others, but as <hi>he was allowed of God to be put in truſt with the Goſpel, even ſo he ſpake, not as pleaſing men but God, which tryeth the heart.</hi> As it was the continuall practiſe of falſe Apoſtles and others to diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtery, by bringing his perſon out of credit, ſo it was his continuall care to counter-worke them, by a profeſſed vindication of himſelfe. We may lawfully juſtifie our ſelves and our actings, when we are not only ſuſpected, but falſly accuſed, and wrongfully charged about them, and that either of theſe two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When we are charged to have done that evill, which we never did, then we may juſtifie our ſelves by a flat deniall; <hi>David</hi> did ſo in that caſe (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.3, 4.) <hi>O Lord my God, if I have done this, if there be iniquity in my hand,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, O God, thou knoweſt I have not done this which many bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den me with. Againe (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.11.) <hi>Falſe witneſſe did riſe up, they laid to my charge things that I knew not;</hi> I have not had ſo much as a thought to do that which they ſay I have actually done.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104248:19"/> Thus he diſcharged himſelfe of thoſe crimes, which indeed he never committed nor was guilty of.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may juſtifie our ſelves lawfully, when the good we have done is charged upon us as an evill deed, or we looked upon as evill doers, when we have done, nothing for the matter, but our duty, and that in the manner according to rule. Thus when <hi>Paul</hi> had juſtified himſelfe, by denying the evill which <hi>Tertullus,</hi> accuſed him of, (<hi>Acts</hi> 24.12, 13.) he preſently juſtified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alſo in what he had done well, though his enemies judged it evill (<hi>ver.</hi> 14.) <hi>But this I confeſſe, that after the way which they call hereſie, ſo worſhip I the God of my fathers, beleeving all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets.</hi> This ſelfe-juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is often very needfull; For as there are ſome who call e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill good, ſo there are others, who call good evill, and make that a mans fault which is his commendation. It was accounted a crime by ſome of old to be leſſe vitious then others, and it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a crime by ſome at this day to be more vertuous then others; to be more holy, more exact, more wiſely preciſe and circumſpect in our wayes then others, many interpret folly, and ſtamp with madneſſe. (2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.13.) <hi>Paul</hi> was thought <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide himſelfe,</hi> a meere Fanatick in his high actings for Jeſus Chriſt; when our actions are thus miſ-repreſented, and put under ſuch diſguiſes, every good man is obliged to doe himſelfe right. For as we may honeſtly accuſe others, and declare the evill that we know they have done, when called to it; ſo we may ſpeak out and declare the good we have done, &amp; maintaine that to be good (if it be good) which we have done, (though many call it evill) when called to it. Thus a man may ſtand upon his termes with all men, and yet be humble, and deeply ſenſible of his owne ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe and vileneſſe before God. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw nothing, upon the matter, but ſin in himſelfe (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14, 24.) <hi>When I would doe good, evill is preſent with me; O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death;</hi> That is, of ſin; as 'tis called (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6.) Thus he ſpake when he had to doe with God; But when he had to doe with men, when he ſaw himſelfe called to anſwer the accuſations, and wipe off the aſperſions which the enemies of the Goſpel caſt upon him. (1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 4.4.) then he ſaith, <hi>I know nothing</hi> (that is, no evill) <hi>by my ſelfe, Paul</hi> was very conſcious of his naturall infirmity, yet very confident of his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104248:19"/> ſpirituall integrity. And therefore when he ſaw the Glory of God was like to be obſcured through his abaſement, and to be ecclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the ſhadowes and darkneſſe which men caſt upon his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, then he tooke due honour to himſelfe, and made the moſt of himſelfe, according to truth, in the eyes of all the world. Thus I have ſhewed what juſtifying of our ſelves is lawfull, and I have done it that we may more clearely diſcerne, what I am to ſhew next, or</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Namely, what that juſtifying of our ſelves is, which indeed is unlawfull, reprovable and blame-worthy; I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it in a few particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They juſtifie themſelves ſinfully, who doe good with a deſire to be ſeene and applauded of men for it; thus Chriſt charged the Phariſees (<hi>Math:</hi> 6.5.) <hi>They pray ſtanding in the Synagogues, and in the corners of the ſtreets, that they may be ſeene of men:</hi> and (<hi>ver:</hi> 16.) <hi>They diſfigure their faces, that they may appeare unto men to faſt.</hi> It is not a ſin to be ſeene of men in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, but to doe good to be ſeene of men is ſinfull, and the patching up of a ſelfe-juſtification.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They juſtifie themſelves ſinfully, who would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, or ſeeme to have done that good, which indeed they have not. There is as much of this hypocriſie lodging and working now in the hearts of the children of men, as was of old in the heart of <hi>Saul</hi> (1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 15.13, 14. to the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe) who profeſſed high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have fulfilled the will of God to a haires breadth; <hi>Bleſſed be thou of the Lord</hi> (ſaid he to <hi>Samuel) I have performed the commandment of the Lord;</hi> Thus he inſiſted upon his integrity, and juſtified himſelfe to the face of <hi>Samuel,</hi> who quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him that he had done the Lords worke to halves.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They juſtifie themſelves ſinfully, who either totally deny, or extenuate and leſſen the evill that they have done; this kinde of ſinfull ſelfe-juſtification was opened largely at the 33<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe of the former Chapter, upon that imprecation made by <hi>Job, If I covered my tranſgreſſion as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my boſome.</hi> I referre the Reader thither for a fuller diſcovery of it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They juſtifie themſelves ſinfully, who mingle their owne workes with the workes or righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt for juſtification; for though ſuch pretend to Chriſt, and ſay they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104248:20"/> take up Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe for juſtification, yet it will be found a ſelfe-juſtification only; ſeeing unleſſe Chriſt juſtifie us wholly, he juſtifieth us not at all; As the Apoſtle concludes (<hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.</hi> 5.4.) <hi>Christ is become of no effect unto you, whoſoever of you are justified by the Law; ye are fallen from grace;</hi> That is, yee who mingle your workes with Grace, are not juſtified by Grace, but (which will be (unleſſe repented of) your condemnation) by your workes.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, They juſtifie themſelves ſinfully, who ſay they are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Chriſt from their ſins, while they continue in their ſins, and hold faſt their iniquities; For as they that mingle their owne good workes with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, are ſelfe-juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſo alſo are they that take hold of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, while they will not let goe, nor part with their evill workes. To looke for juſtification while we continue in the love and practiſe of any knowne ſin and unrighteouſneſſe, is as ſinfull as to expect juſtification by our owne righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But doth not the Scripture ſay, that <hi>God juſtifieth the ungodly (Rom.</hi> 4.5.)</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Though God juſtifieth the ungodly, yet the juſtified are not ungodly; God juſtifieth the ungodly and makes them holy by the grace of ſanctification, as well as righteous by the grace of juſtification: righteouſneſſe of life is alwayes the fruit of righteouſneſſe by faith. Therefore if any man continuing in any knowne ſin, ſaith he is juſtified, he hath juſtified himſelfe, for none doe ſo who are juſtified of God. O how deeply are they condemned by God who thus juſtifie themſelves! Nothing is more deſirable then to be juſtified by God, and nothing is more dangerous then to juſtifie our ſelves, either by our owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, or in our unrighteouſneſſe. Now as to juſtifie our ſelves any of theſe wayes, is exceeding ſinfull before God, ſo to juſtifie our ſelves any way, layeth us open or obnoxious to the cenſures of men. And that's the reaſon why this holy man <hi>Job</hi> was ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cenſured; For though he juſtified not himſelfe in any of thoſe ſences which are are ſinfull, yet he did ſome way juſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and while he juſtified himſelfe only as he might, he was condemned as having juſtified himſelfe in a way which he might not. We had need be very cautious, how we any way or in any kinde juſtifie our ſelves, few having done it without incurring cenſure, if not condemnation from others.</p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:104248:20"/>
                  <p>But what was <hi>Jobs</hi> ſelfe-juſtification, or of what kinde, that it raiſed ſuch a duſt, yea kindled ſuch a flame of Anger in the breaſt of <hi>Elihu?</hi> I anſwer;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> did not juſtifie himſelfe by lyes or falſhoods; that was not the matter for which <hi>Elihu</hi> was angry with <hi>Job,</hi> but becauſe he ſuppoſed he was more tender of his owne name then of Gods. Thus the Text ſpeakes expreſſely; <hi>Against Job was his wrath kindled, becauſe he juſtified himſelfe rather then God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>To juſtifie our ſelves rather then God, is not only ſinfull but fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitious, not only ſinfull but blaſphemous.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let God be true and every man a lyar</hi> (Rom. 3.4.) woe to thoſe who goe about to ſave their owne honour, by ſpeaking that which reflects diſhonour upon God, or who keepe their owne credit untoucht, by expoſing his to any hazzard; let God be juſt and every man unrighteous. As whoſoever exalts himſelfe, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles God (when we exalt our ſelves vainely, we humble God as much as we can, and ſo it will be interpreted) ſo he that juſtifies himſelfe in any degree unduely accuſeth God, how much more he that juſtifieth himſelfe rather then God. To commend or praiſe our ſelves, in the hearing of men, is unſavory, to commend or praiſe our ſelves rather then men (who are our fellowes, yea though our inferiors) is odious, how much more to juſtifie our ſelves rather then God, who is infinitely above us. It becomes the beſt of men, to accuſe, judge and condemne themſelves, to draw up their owne enditement, and ſay, we have deſerved worſe then we ſuffer from the hand of God; and have done leſſe then duty requires at our hand.</p>
                  <p>But, becauſe to juſtifie our ſelves rather then God, is a thing ſo horrid, few will be brought under this conviction, that they are guilty of it, or chargeable with it. And therefore I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make it appeare, that there are many who though they doe not juſtifie themſelves rather then God directly and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, yet they doe it ſecretly or conſtructively. I ſhall make out this in generall as it may concern any man, while I more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew, how <hi>Job</hi> incurred this ſuſpition, and gave <hi>Elihu</hi> more then a probable ground to ſay, that he juſtified himſelfe rather then God. <hi>Job</hi> never ſaid, he was more juſt then God, but he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104248:21"/> ſaid many things which gave <hi>Elihu</hi> occaſion to ſay, That ſurely he <hi>juſtified himſelfe rather then God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, When he ſpake ſo largely of his own innocency, ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five whole Chapters in the vindication of it, and ſpake ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, comparatively, of the righteouſneſſe and juſtice of God, this might bring him under a ſuſpition of juſtifying himſelfe rather then God. For what could this intimate to his hearers, but that he had better performed the part of a gracious and righteous man, then God had of a gracious Father or righteous Judge. Though all that be true (how much ſoever it is) which we ſpeak of our ſelves, yet it is not good to ſpeak much, much leſſe all of our ſelves; eſpecially when upon that account, we may ſeeme to diſpute either the juſtice or goodneſſe of God in dealing out the troubles and afflictions, under which we ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, While <hi>Job</hi> did ſo often and ſo boldly offer to plead his cauſe before Gods tribunall, and was ſo importunate for a Hearing, this carried a ſecret implication, that God had not dealt well with him, or at leaſt had not conſidered his cauſe throughly, for if he had, ſurely he ſhould have found more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable dealing from God then he dayly experienced.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, While <hi>Job</hi> complained ſo often and greatly of the greatneſſe of his afflictions, of the weight and heavineſſe of the hand of God upon him, and, that he being but a poore worme, the great and mighty God ſhould ſtretch out his ſtrong hand againſt him; This alſo might be conſtrued, as if he thought God did not take a due meaſure of his infirmities, but let temptations take hold of him which were not common to man, and burdened him beyond what he was able to beare. Now, what was this, but to juſtifie himſelfe rather then God?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, While he complained that the hand of God had not only touched him, but even abode and dwelt upon him, that he was conſumed from morning to morning, that he had not only weariſome nights, but moneths of vanity appointed to him, that his afflictions were not only exceeding ſharpe, but exceeding long, yea that though they were extreamly violent, yet perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, this bare hard upon the goodneſs and wiſdome of God. For, to ſay that God over-acts in the meaſure, and exceeds in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of our afflictions, reflect alike upon the honour of God, and are rather a juſtification of our ſelves in bearing the croſſe, then of God in laying it onn.</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:104248:21"/>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Job</hi> in ſeverall paſſages of this booke deſired God to make an end of him, and take him out of this world; he was troubled that God did not kill him out of hand, or out-right; this was a juſtification of himſelfe rather then God, as if he knew better, whether it were more fit for him to live in a ſickly, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, painfull condition, or to be delivered out of it by death. As we ſhould be willing to die, when God calls, ſo to live till God calls, and not to haſten death; He that beleeves (as he ought) will not make haſt out of the troubles of this world, much leſſe out of the world, becauſe he finds it troubleſome.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, He ſeemed to juſtifie himſelfe rather then God, while he was ſo much troubled, becauſe God did not preſently reveale to him the reaſon of his troubles; <hi>Why is light given to a man whoſe way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</hi> was his complaint (<hi>Chap.</hi> 3.23.) that is, wherefore is the light of this naturall life given to me, whoſe way is in the darke, and who know not the reaſon why I am thus afflicted? We ought to ſit downe in this aſſurance, be our condition never ſo reſtleſſe, that the moſt wiſe God hath a reaſon for every ſtroake of trouble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> layeth upon our loynes, though we ſee it not. They who cannot fully reſigne themſelves and their wayes to God, yea reſolve their wills into the will of God, are much diſquieted and reſtleſſe in their minds, when they ſee not the reaſon of Gods dealing with them, or why it is ſo with them? Let all ſuch know, this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is to make our ſelves wiſer then God, and to juſtifie our ſelves rather then him. And therefore from all theſe conſiderations take theſe two Inferences, which may keepe us ever at a diſtance from this high preſumption, yea (which we ſhould carefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd) from the ſhaddow and appearance of it; The juſtifying of our ſelves rather then God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is enough to condemne us under the guilt of this ſin, if we allow not all that God doth to be good, yea and beſt for us, how much or how long, or in what kinde ſoever be is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to afflict us with evill. It is our duty <hi>to accept,</hi> that is, to take well at Gods hand, <hi>the puniſhment of our iniquity</hi> (Lev: 26.41.) how much more to welcome the ſoreſt and heavieſt croſſe which he is pleaſed to lay upon us, either for the chaſtiſement of our faylings and falls, or for the tryall and exerciſe of our graces. It is ſaid (2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 3.36.) <hi>Whatſoever the king</hi> (meaning <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid)
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104248:22"/> did; pleaſed all the people;</hi> There was a wonderfull conſent and harmony between the peoples ſpirit and <hi>Davids</hi> actions; Surely whatſoever God doth, ſhould pleaſe all his people, what ever he diſpenſeth, be it ſweet or ſowre, hard or ſoft, light or darkneſſe, it ſhould pleaſe all his people, and pleaſe them high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and ſo farre as we come ſhort of this frame of heart, ſo farre doe we juſtifie our ſelves rather then God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It is a fault not only if we are not ſatisfied and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with what God doth, but if we doe not praiſe and glorifie God in and for what he doth; and that not only in his juſtice that he hath done us no wrong, but in his goodneſſe, that he hath done all for our profit.</hi> That which turnes to mans profit, ſhould alſo turne to the praiſe of God; But (as the holy Apoſtle aſſureth us, <hi>Heb:</hi> 12.10.) God chaſtneth his children <hi>for their profit</hi> (and that the beſt and nobleſt profit) <hi>that they might be partakers of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> therefore we ought to praiſe and glorifie him, or to glorifie him with our praiſes while he is chaſtning us. <hi>Truly God is good to Iſrael</hi> (Pſal. 73.1.) He is ſo, not only when he gives <hi>Iſrael</hi> outward good things, or things good to fenſe, but when he afflicts, when he writes bitter things againſt his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſhewes them only viſions of ſorrow and matter of amazement. Till our ſoules are wrought up to this Juſtification of God in his goodneſſe, when things are worſt with us, we in ſome degree juſtifie our ſelves rather then God.</p>
                  <p>Againe, for as much as <hi>Job,</hi> who cannot in all things be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted from this charge of juſtifying himſelfe rather then God, was yet of another ſpirit and principle, then indeed or profeſſedly to juſtifie himſelfe rather then God.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>We may ſpeake amiſſe and wrong God when we doe not intend it, nor have the least thought to doe ſo.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> prayeth for the pardon of unknowne ſins (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12, 13.) <hi>Cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults, keepe backe thy ſervant alſo from preſumptuous ſins, let them not have dominion over me.</hi> To juſtifie our ſelves rather then God knowingly, is a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſin; to lay any blame upon God directly is blaſphemy, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> prayed not only to be kept from ſuch groſſe ſins, but to be cleanſed from ſecret ſins, that is, from thoſe ſins which he did not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104248:22"/> know that he had committed them, and which he never had any intent to commit. We may ſo miſ-place words and miſ-guide actions, when we thinke not of it, that we may quickly ſin againſt God, yea and juſtifie our ſelves rather then God; That which we doe or ſpeake is to be judged by a rule, whether it be good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, not meerely by our intentions though good, nor by our not intending of evill. We may be judged to have done or ſaid <hi>evill, though we meant no evill in doing or in ſaying ſo.</hi> Words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons well meant may ſometimes juſtly undergoe an ill conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Therefore begge of God to ſet a watch over your mouth, and to keepe the doore of your lips, let nothing paſſe unexamined. 'Tis our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to read every word over and over before we ſpeake it; Many heare ill, who have ſpoken well, how much more may they who ſpeake doubtfully or dangerouſly.

                     <hi>The weake and impotent are naturally angry and paſſionate.</hi> Therefore we had need looke to our paſſions, that they grow not ſtrong, for they will ſoone proclaime us weake: he is a wiſe man indeed, that can be at once wiſe and angry. (<hi>Proverbs</hi> 19.11.) <hi>The diſcretion of a man deferreth his anger, and it is his glory to paſſe over a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion;</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:104248:23"/> And as there <hi>Solomon</hi> teacheth us, that diſcretion ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtereth anger, ſo he aſſureth us, that angry perſons are more then indiſcreete, fooliſh. (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.9.) <hi>Anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.</hi> Anger often aſſaults the prudent, but if it abides and takes up its lodging in any boſome, 'tis in the boſome of a foole, at leaſt, in that poynt, he doth fooliſhly who lendeth his boſome (though but one night) for anger to lodge in. And as at all times, ſo then eſpecially we ſhould narrowly watch and ſeverely bridle our paſſions, when (as <hi>Elihu</hi> here did) we undertake to adviſe thoſe who are miſtaken, or to reduce thoſe that are out of the way; when we give counſel to others, we ſhould be ſedate and quiet our ſelves. A Phyſician muſt not be angry with his patient, nor is it proper to apply medicinall healing counſel to the mind of another with an exulcerated minde. Much might be ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this anger of <hi>Elihu,</hi> but I have ſpoken to that before in opening the former verſe, therefore I ſhall not ſtay here upon it; but proceed to conſider the reaſon why he was ſo.</p>
                  <q>Becauſe they had found no anſwer, and yet had condemned Job.</q>
                  <p>Not to find an anſwer may proceed;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From a defect of paines and induſtry in ſeeking it; An anſwer muſt be ſought and digg'd for it muſt be ſtudied and prayed for, elſe it will not be found.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The not finding of an anſwer, may ariſe from the defect of ability, not of induſtry; many labour hard, but can make nothing of it; 'Tis probable <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends laboured much, yet found no anſwer; And then it was no defect of induſtry but of ability, they found no anſwer, becauſe they could not. They (as we commonly ſpeake) did even beate their braines, and bite their nayles for an anſwer, but could not attaine it, they pumpt hard, but the water would not come, God hid the thing from their eyes; ſo then, they had not found any anſwer, becauſe after all their ſearch they could not; nor ſhould it ſeeme ſtrange to us that they could not. At beſt we know but in part here, and till God by his Spirit teach us, we know nothing at all; So that I ſay, it ſhould not ſeeme ſtrange to us, that theſe wiſe and good men could find no anſwer for <hi>Job,</hi> but that which follows ſeemes ſtrange, even to amazement, that though they could not, <hi>yet</hi>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:104248:23"/> (which, how alſo could they anſwer to their owne conſciences!)
<q>had condemned Job.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What, condemne a man, and not anſwer him? 'tis worſe then to condemne a man, and not heare him. Poſſibly he that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned unheard, may yet deſerve a condemnation; But if we condemne a man unanſwered, he certainly, as to us, is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned undeſervedly. And therefore this courſe of proceeding (if any) is liable not only to ſuſpition whether it be right, but to condemnation as utterly unrighteous. Though it may be a good mans caſe not to find an anſwer, yet ſurely a good man will not condemne when he cannot anſwer.</p>
                  <p>But it may be demanded; Did <hi>Jobs</hi> friends indeed find no anſwer before they condemned him? we have heard of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers all along. No ſooner had <hi>Job</hi> ended his former ſpeeches, but they preſently anſwered (<hi>Chap.</hi> 4.1.) <hi>Then Eliphaz the Temanite anſwered and ſaid</hi> (Chap. 8, 1.) <hi>Then anſwered Bildad the Shuhite and ſaid</hi> (Chap. 11.1.) <hi>Then anſwered Zophar the Naamathite and ſaid;</hi> yea they all three anſwered <hi>Job</hi> a ſecond time, and two of them a Third, how then could <hi>Elihu</hi> juſtly ſay, <hi>they found no anſwer, and yet had condemned Job?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For anſwer to this objection; I ſay, They anſwered <hi>Job,</hi> but they did not anſwer ſufficiently. The vulgar latine tranſlation puts this gloſſe (which is more then the rules of tranſlation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) into the text, rendring the originall thus;<note place="margin">Ed quòd non inveniſſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſionem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalem. <hi>Vulg:</hi>

                     <hi>Becauſe they had found no rationall anſwer, and yet had condemned Job.</hi> They did not find out nor hit upon the right anſwer. Improper and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient anſwers, how many ſoever of them we heape up againſt any mans argument, are no anſwers, they are not worthy to be called anſwers.

All the wicked ſhall at laſt be condemned, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:104248:24"/> none ought to be condemned, nor are any condemned juſtly now but the wicked; <hi>He that juſtifieth the wicked, and he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the juſt, even they both are an abomination to the Lord, (Pro.</hi> 17.15.) There is a very elegant tranſpoſition of the words in the Hebrew; we may render the text thus; <hi>He that juſtifieth the wicked, and wickedeth the juſt,</hi> &amp;c. The law of <hi>Moſes</hi> gave an expreſſe rule againſt this perverſion of Judgement, in termes quite croſſe to thoſe in <hi>Solomon</hi> (Deut: 25.1.) <hi>If there be any contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie between men, and they come unto Judgement, that the Judges may Judge them, then they ſhall juſtifie the righteous, and condemne the wicked.</hi> Which you may render thus; <hi>They ſhall juſtifie the juſt, and wickediſe the wicked,</hi> that is, they ſhall declare the juſt man juſt, and the wicked man to be wicked. That man either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is, or is accounted wicked, who is caſt in his cauſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.

                  <p>Note ſecondly.</p>
                  <q>To condemne opinions or perſons when we cannot anſwer them, is a practiſe juſtly condemnable.</q>
                  <p>'Tis unjuſt (as was intimated before) to condemne a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is heard. For though poſſibly a man unheard may have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice when he is condemned, yet all agree 'tis injuſtice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him when he is not heard; Now if it be injuſtice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne a wicked man before he is heard, how unjuſt is it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne a man in whom we can find no wickedneſſe after we have heard him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From the manner of the phraſe here uſed, Note.</p>
                  <q>To condemne a man is to render him wicked.</q>
                  <p>Condemnation (as was ſhewed) is due only to the wicked, and if an innocent be condemned, he is reputed wicked, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives puniſhment as guilty. As that ſentence of condemnation which proceeds out of the mouth of God againſt impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and evill doers, bindes the guilt of their evill deeds upon them, and delivers them up to puniſhment; ſo he that condemnes his brother, faſtneth guilt upon him, and ſpeakes him deſerving puniſhment; for as where guilt is, puniſhment followeth, ſo a fault is conceived to goe before. There are theſe three things in ſin, the fault, the guilt, and the blot, or pollution of it; he that faſtneth guilt by condemnation, faſtneth the fault and blot much more; how ſad is it then to be deſervedly under condemnation? And how great is the priviledge of beleevers, to whom (though in themſelves they deſerve it) <hi>there is no condemnation!</hi> (Rom 8.1.) They who in this life are paſt condemnation, are alſo paſſed from death to life. Many are condemned who are good in the ſight of God; but all condemnation makes a man evill, yea wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     </gap>auſe every ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation renders a man wicked in the eyes of worldly men, therefore righteous Magiſtrates will not condemne haſtily; They will not judge (as Chriſt did not, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.3.) <hi>after the ſight of their eyes, nor reprove after the he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

                     </gap>ding to the firſt report which is made, without examination. We muſt not judge thus, becauſe we muſt judge in righteouſneſſe, which cannot be, if we judge thus. How deliberate, how tender ſhould we be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning any man, ſeeing condemnation doth not only impoſe a puniſhment upon, but ſuppoſe a crime, a wickedneſſe, a fault in him. It is grievous enough to beare puniſhment, but to beare the burden of a crime or fault, is in reality much more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing <hi>Elihu</hi> declares his anger againſt <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends, becauſe they condemned <hi>Job,</hi> and had found no anſwer. Some will ſay, did not <hi>Elihu</hi> condemne <hi>Job</hi> ſo too? No, he condemned him indeed, but he firſt found an anſwer. Againe, <hi>Elihu</hi> condemned <hi>Job,</hi> but not as his friends condemned him, his friends condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him as to his ſtate, judging him unſound at heart; But <hi>Elihu</hi> condemned him only as to this or that particular act or ſpeech; He condemned him, Firſt, becauſe he ſpake ſo largely in the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of himſelfe (<hi>Chap:</hi> 33.8, 9, 10, 11.) <hi>Surely thou haſt ſpoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, ſaying, I am clean without tranſgreſſion; I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me.</hi> (And Chap. 34.5, 6.) <hi>For Job hath ſaid, I am righteous, and God hath taken away my judgement; ſhould I lye againſt my right, my wound is incurable without tranſgreſſion.</hi> Secondly, he condemned him for complying with the wicked, not that he thought <hi>Job</hi> acted like them, but becauſe being a godly man, he in his ſufferings ſpake ſometimes and behaved himſelfe like them (<hi>Chap.</hi> 34.8.) <hi>Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</hi> Further, he charged him with ſtubbornneſſe againſt God (<hi>Chap.</hi> 34.37.) <hi>For he addeth rebellion unto his ſin;</hi> and (which ſounds ſtrangely) with an eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towards evill men (<hi>Chap:</hi> 36.17.) <hi>Thou haſt fulfilled the judgement of the wicked, judgement and juſtice take hold on thee.</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:104248:25"/> Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> condemned <hi>Job</hi> many wayes, but he condemned him not, without finding an anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Yea, I may ſay, <hi>Elihu</hi> is he, who in this great controverſie and difficulty, hath found an anſwer, and yet hath not condemned <hi>Job,</hi> that is, he hath not condemned him as his three friends had condemned him: He condemned not <hi>Job</hi> as one perverſe and crooked in his wayes, he condemned him not as one that feared not God and eſchewed not evill, He condemned him not as an hypocrite, rotten at heart and unſound in his eſtate; Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> found an anſwer for <hi>Job,</hi> but condemned him not, no not while his wrath was kindled againſt him, becauſe he juſtified himſelfe rather then God.</p>
                  <p>And the proceſſe of this booke will ſhew, that though <hi>Elihu</hi> (in the ſence ſpoken of) condemned not <hi>Job,</hi> yet he found an unanſwerable anſwer, ſuch an anſwer, as to which <hi>Job</hi> neither could nor would make any reply; and that is the ſpeciall buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we have to looke at in proſecuting his diſcourſe, even to finde out the anſwer which he found; for that will be as the key of the worke, to open the whole matter to us, and to ſhew us wherein <hi>Job</hi> had either fayled or exceeded, either in bearing the croſſes layd upon him by God, or in managing this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie with his friends.</p>

                     <hi>yet Elihu waited to ſpeak with Job.</hi> The word notes the moſt patient expectation, a waiting with much long-ſufferance, a waiting alſo in much confidence, as reſerving our ſelves till better times, or for a more favourable diſpenſation. So the word is uſed (<hi>Dan.</hi> 12.12.) <hi>Bleſſed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thouſand three hundred, and five and thirty dayes;</hi> that is, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he that waiteth out thoſe dayes of the Prophecy there ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified; he hath a ſtretched out patience, that waiteth to the very

Such an expectation is here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to <hi>Elihu,</hi> he waited for the iſſue of that great and long debate between <hi>Job</hi> and his three friends, or he gaped for ſuch a ſolid anſwer as might ſatisfie him, and determine the Queſtion under debate; <hi>Now Elihu had waited till Job had ſpoken.</hi>

The Apoſtle <hi>James.

And as to time a thing well in acting, ſo to time it well in ſpeaking, is the better halfe of it. <hi>Elihu waited till Job had ſpoken.</hi> What I have now touched, may be one reaſon of his waiting; But the ſpeciall reaſon of it follows in the text.</p>

Here <hi>Elihu</hi> calls <hi>Jobs</hi> friends <hi>Elders,</hi> and we may take him either ſpeaking ſtrictly, that they were his Elders in time, or ſpeaking modeſtly, that they were his Elders in wiſdome, knowledge, and underſtanding, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was not haſty to ſpeake, but gave them their ſcope, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till <hi>Job</hi> had ſpoken, <hi>Becauſe they were elder then he.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt in General.</p>
                  <q>Young men ſhould ſhew reſpect and waite upon their Elders.</q>
                  <p>The Apoſtle would not have <hi>Timothy</hi> ſlighted, though young, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12.) <hi>Let no man deſpiſe thy youth;</hi> He chargeth the people not to deſpiſe <hi>Timothy</hi> becauſe young; and he chargeth <hi>Timothy</hi> to carry it ſo, that none might have the ſhew of a cauſe to deſpiſe him though young; <hi>Let no man deſpiſe thy youth;</hi> let not thoſe that ſeeke occaſion finde it. Now, as young men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially young Miniſters ſhould be ſo holy and grave in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, as not to draw diſreſpect or contempt upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and as no man ought to deſpiſe the young meerly becauſe they are young; ſo all men ought to honour old age. The old Law was expreſſe for it (<hi>Levit.</hi> 19.32.) <hi>Thou ſhalt riſe up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and feare thy God, I am the Lord.</hi> See, how theſe two are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Thou ſhalt honour the face of the old man, and feare thy God;</hi> As if he had ſaid, honour old men in the feare of God, or ſhew feare to God in the reverence and honour which thou giveſt to old men, who having lived a long time or many dayes in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104248:28"/> world, bear at leaſt a ſhadow of the eternity of God who is <hi>The anciant of dayes,</hi> who lives and abides for ever. There is a two-fold ſtampe of God upon old men, more then upon other men. Firſt their very age hath a ſtamp of God upon it, for though all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges put together, are not a moment to eternity, yet, as to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and reckoning, old age beares the faireſt image of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Secondly, old men bear a reſemblance of God in their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ('tis to be ſuppoſed that the oldeſt are wileſt, as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks <hi>v.</hi> 7.) So then old men are to be reverenced not only for their precedence in time, but for their experience, wiſdome, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and prudence,<note place="margin">Seris venit u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ab annis.</note> all which repreſent them more like to God then younger men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Look to the ſpeciall way wherein <hi>Elihu</hi> ſhewed reverence to his Elders, even by his long ſilence; he did not rudely not raſhly breake into diſcourſe, but waited till they had done. This modeſty of <hi>Elihu</hi> is both commendable and imitable, who would ſay nothing as longe as <hi>Job</hi> or any of his friends had any thing to ſay,<note place="margin">Mira in hoc e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucet antiquuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum in publicis concertationi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus gravitas et ſtupendum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violabilitèr ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vati in dicendo ac reſpondendo ordinis exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum. <hi>Bold.</hi>
                     </note> becauſe they were elder then he. As the light of nature teacheth reverence to the aged in all caſes, ſo more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, in this. There ſhines (as to this poynt an admirable comlineſſe in the diſputes of the Ancients, and a moſt eminent example of order inviolably kept both in propoſing and anſwering. Their rule or maxime was, <hi>Let the Seniors ſpeake, let the Juniors hear. Let Old men teach, let young men learne.</hi> It is the note of a learned Commentator upon this place from what himſelfe had obſerved. Living (ſaith he) once at <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where, in a Monaſtery,<note place="margin">Majores natu loquantur junio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res audiant; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes doceant, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doleſcentes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant; Pulcher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rima diſciplinae ſententia. <hi>Druſ.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>three Indians</hi> were brought up and inſtructed in the Chriſtian Religion, I could not but admire to behold how ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and ſtrictly they kept to the Lawes of ſpeaking, the younger not offering a word till the Elder had done; The practice of theſe <hi>Indians</hi> brought with them out of Heatheniſme may reprove the imprudence of many, yea the impudence of ſome young men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, who will be firſt in talk, when their betters and elders are in place; The Prophet threatned this as a great judgment (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.5.) <hi>The Child ſhall behave himſelf proudly againſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</hi> The child is not to be taken here ſtrictly, but for any inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in age, though poſſibly himſelf be arrived to the ſtate of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. As if the Prophet had ſaid, there ſhall be a generall confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion among all degrees of men, without reſpect had to age or
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104248:28"/> place, every ſtripling will take the boldneſs to talk and act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly before his betters. Obeyſance and ſilence, bowing the body, and holding the peace, are reſpects which ought to be paid to our Superiours whether in time or authority.</p>
                  <p>But as young men ſhould not be forward to ſpeak in the preſence of their elders, ſo they ſhould not be afraid to ſpeak when there is cauſe for it, eſpecially when their elders forbear or refuſe to ſpeak any more. Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> who had long kept his mouth (as <hi>David</hi> in another caſe did Pſal: 39.1.) <hi>with a bridle, and was dumb with ſilence, yet at laſt his heart was hot within him, and while he was muſing, the fire burned, and</hi> (as it followeth) <hi>he ſpake with his tongue.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>When Elihu ſaw it,</hi> that is, when he was as much aſſured of it (by their geſture and carriage) as if it had been viſible, that thoſe three men had no more to ſay, or would ſay no more (for the words may be referred indifferently to their will or power, when, I ſay, he ſaw they had no more to ſay) Either, firſt, to convince <hi>Job</hi> of error, or ſecondly, to defend the truth of God, which they had undertaken (when he ſaw this) <hi>his wrath was kindled,</hi> at that inſtant time, and for that very reaſon, <hi>his wrath was kindled.</hi> Some conceive (as was ſhewed before) that this anger proceeded from the paſſionateneſs of his ſpirit, and ſo tax him with it as his fault; but I rather conſent with thoſe who ſay it proceeded from his zeal for God, and ſo it was his vertue and his praiſe.</p>
                  <p>I have met with theſe words two or three times already ſince I entred upon this Chapter, and therefore I ſhall not ſtay upon them here; And as this anger of <hi>Elihu</hi> was ſpoken of before, ſo the ſame reaſon which was given before of his anger is repeated and reported hear again; <hi>Then his wrath was kindled becauſe they had no anſwer in their mouths,</hi> that is, becauſe they had no more to ſay againſt <hi>Job</hi> whom they had condemned; and becauſe they had no more to ſay for God whoſe cauſe in afflicting <hi>Job</hi> they had defended; I ſhall only adde a few brief Notes upon this Verſe, and ſo paſſe on.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some men anſwer till they have no more to anſwer.</q>
                  <p>'Tis very poſſible for a good and a wiſe man to be at the bottom of his reaſon, in ſome points, or to be brought to ſuch a wall, that he can go no further; <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfection,</hi> which as it is true of all outward commodities and conveniences, which men enjoy, ſo both of their corporal and intellectual abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or of what they can either do or ſay. The beſt of men may ſee the end of their beſt perfections in all things, but Grace, and the hope of Glory. Their ſtock and treaſure may be quite ſpent, their ſpring exhauſted, and they gone ro their utmoſt line and length. There's no more anſwer in their mouth, nor work in their hand.</p>
                  <p>Secondly note;
<q>It may put a wiſe man into paſſion to ſee how ill ſome wiſe men uſe their reaſon, or that they can make no further uſe of it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then was the anger of <hi>Elihu</hi> kindled when he ſaw, they could anſwer no more, or that <hi>there was no anſwer in the mouth of theſe three men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As the anger of <hi>Elihu</hi> is often ſpoken of, ſo ſtill we find ſome what or other is aſſigned as a ground of it;</p>
                  <p>Whence note;
<q>We ſhould ſee good reaſon for our anger before we are angry, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our own cauſe, or in the cauſe of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is nothing can excuſe anger but the cauſe of it. Reaſon is a good plea for paſſion; And he that hath a true reaſon for his anger, will probably manage his anger with reaſon, yea, and mingle it with grace; And ſo his proves not only a rational, but a gracious anger.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly note;
<q>Provoked patience breaks out into greater paſſion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the former Verſe, we find <hi>Job</hi> waiting, he waited long and patiently; but being diſappointed of what he waited for, his wrath broke out; <hi>His anger was kindled;</hi> As when God waits long and is diſappointed, his anger is encreaſed in the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it (Rom. 2.4, 5. ver:) <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:104248:29"/> and forbearance and long-ſuffering, not knowing that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God leads thee to repentance? but after thy hardneſſe and impenitent heart, treaſureſt up wrath,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, the more patience God ſpends upon thee, the more wrath is treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>r thee, and that wrath will break out the more fiercely and violently to conſume thee, the longer it hath been treaſured up. Now I ſay, as the wrath of God is the more declared againſt man, by how much his patience is the more abuſed; So the abuſed patience of man will turn to greater anger, and he groweth the more paſſionate by how much he hath been the more and the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deceived. Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> is ſtill deſcribed acting angerly, yet in the very next verſe we ſhall find him ſpeaking ſoberly, plainly and to purpoſe.</p>

He cannot look through, nor ſee to the end of things; for as it is the great and ſole priviledge of God to caſt an eye quite through all intermediate, both acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and revolutions, and to ſee the end from the beginning: ſo it is more peculiar to thoſe that are aged and long experienced, to ſee much of the end of things in their beginnings, or to ſee what is like to be as well as what is. 'Tis the part of a wiſe man to conſider what may come, and whether things tend; there is much weakneſs and deficiency in young men as to this. As moſt young men want ſences exerciſed (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes of all un-improved Chriſtians of what age ſoever (<hi>Heb:</hi> 5.19.) as I ſay, moſt young men want ſences exerciſed) to diſcerne what is good or evill; ſo they want ſences exerciſed to diſcerne what good or evill is like to be, they rarely ſee effects in their cauſes, or events in their prognoſticks. Therefore <hi>Elihu</hi> might well ſay, <hi>I am young, therefore I durst not venture to ſhew mine opinion.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104248:31"/> Paul</hi> giveth <hi>Timothy</hi> ſomewhat a ſtrange warning (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.22.) <hi>Flee youthfull luſts. Timothy</hi> was young, but was he noted for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to any youthfull luſts? what luſts doth he meane? ſurely not drunkenneſſe, nor uncleanneſſe, nor any looſe behaviour; for though the moſt ſober and temperate young men, have in them the ſeed of all theſe, yea of every luſt, yet <hi>Timothy</hi> at that time was a pattern, a mirrour, not only of ſob iety, but of holineſſe; and <hi>Paul</hi> was even forced to bid him take more liberty in the uſe of the creature, then he uſed to allow himſelfe; <hi>Drink no longer water, but uſe a little wine for thy ſtomack ſake, and for thy often infirmities.</hi> Surely <hi>Timothy</hi> was a man that fled ſuch youthfull luſts faſt and far enough when he drank nothing but water, and muſt be bid to drink a little wine (1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 5.23.) What luſts then were they which <hi>Timothy</hi> was exhorted to flee? the words following (<hi>ver.</hi> 23, 24, 25.) ſeeme to cleare it; that becauſe he was young, he ſhould take heed of ruſhing into unneceſſary Queſtions and diſputes, which young men are apt to doe in the heat of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; nor are there any luſts of the lower or ſenſuall appetite, to which the heart of man is more intemperately and vainely carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, then to thoſe of the underſtanding; and therefore the Apoſtle counſels <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>avoid unprofitable Queſtions, knowing that theſe gender ſtrife;</hi> (Thoſe Queſtions cannot promote faith in or holineſſe towards God, which only ſtirre up and foment ſtrife among men) <hi>and the ſervants of the Lord must not ſtrive, but be gentle to all, and patient.</hi> Theſe vertues, and graces, are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed chiefely to the youthfull luſts which <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> to take heed of; As if he had ſaid, <hi>Be not too hot-headed and haſty (as young men are very apt to be) in purſuing of controverſies and entangling thy ſelfe in the thickets of Opinioniſts. Elihu</hi> was of an excellent temper, who, becauſe young, was afraid and durſt not ſhew his opinion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>It is good to feare, and ſuſpect our own judgements, <hi>or,</hi> to feare that we may erre, they ſeldome doe or ſpeak amiſſe who feare they may.</q>
                  <p>An over-confidence of being in the right, hath ſetled many in a wrong way; to be under a ſence of our readineſſe to fall, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves us from falling, (<hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.1.) <hi>When Ephraim ſpake
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104248:31"/> trembling, then, he exalted himſelfe;</hi> There are ſeverall ſences gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of that place, but according to our tranſlation, the meaning is carried thus; When <hi>Ephraim</hi> was in an humble frame, and jealous of himſelfe, not confident, nor over-bold (as ſome are who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to carry all before them) when he ſpake trembling, or did even tremble to ſpeake, then he did that which tended to his own advancement and exaltation. This gracious trembling doth at once ſettle us the faſter, and rayſe us the higher in the wayes and things of God. <hi>It is a high poynt of wiſdome to have low appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of our ſelves;</hi> though that be true,<note place="margin">Tanti eris aliis quanti tibi fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</note> 
                     <hi>You ſhall be eſteemed of others, as you eſteem your ſelves; If a man under-value himſelfe others will; yet,</hi> 'tis beſt erring on that hand; <hi>Let the price be much too low, rather then any thing too high, when you are occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to put a value upon or rate your ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, Conſider what an excellent ſpeaker <hi>Elihu</hi> was when he came to it, as will appeare hereafter, yet ſee how he ſtood trembling, he durſt not ſpeake, nor offer his opinion.</p>
                  <p>Hence note:
<q>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſually they who have moſt ability to ſpeak, are most back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſpeak, or ſparing of ſpeech.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are not eaſily brought to it, who have it in them; The belly of <hi>Elihu</hi> was as full with matter, as an Egge with meate or a bottle with wine; yet how ſlow was he in opening himſelfe? They who are and have leaſt are moſt deſirous, if not ambitious, to appeare moſt, and would make up in ſeeming what they are not in being. As <hi>Elihu</hi> in this verſe hath ſhewed himſelfe afraid to ſay any thing, ſo he ſhewes us in the next, who, he hoped, would have ſaid all, and altogether have ſaved him a labour.</p>

                  <p>There's the reaſon of it; we render the firſt word of this eight verſe by the Adverſative particle <hi>(But) there is a ſpirit in man;</hi> it is uſually rendered by the Affirmative particle, <hi>verily,</hi> truly, or indeed. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

Wiſdome is an Influence or an Inſpiration from the Almighty; knowledge to order common things is of the Lord (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.26, 29.) <hi>His God doth inſtruct him</hi> (the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he meanes) <hi>to diſcretion</hi> (in ordering the ground) <hi>and doth teach him;</hi> how much more in ſpirituall things and the myſteries of the kingdome of heaven. (<hi>Prov.</hi> 16.1.) <hi>The preparation of the heart in man, and the Anſwer of the tongue</hi> (that is, The fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the heart for any right anſwer of the tongue) <hi>is from the Lord;</hi> both the generall preparation of the heart for ſervice or uſe, and the ſpeciall preparation of it to this or that ſervice &amp; uſe is of the Lord, &amp; ſo is the Anſwer of the tongue for the diſcharge of it. (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.26.) <hi>God giveth to a man that is good in his ſight, wiſdome and knowledge and joy;</hi> As God giveth man the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things, ſo wiſdome to know how to order and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age the things that he knoweth; Some have more knowledge then they know how to manage, their knowledge maſters them, they are not maſters of their knowledge; they have more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge then wiſdome.

Where <hi>Saul</hi> having received the unction from <hi>Samuel,</hi> both as an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of and a preparation for the exerciſe of his kingly office over <hi>Iſrael; Samuel</hi> tells him (<hi>ver.</hi> 6.) <hi>The Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, and thou ſhalt prophecy with them</hi> (that is, with the company of Prophets ſpoken of in the former verſe) <hi>and ſhalt be turned into another man.</hi> And the holy text adds (<hi>ver.</hi> 9.) <hi>God gave</hi> (or as we put in the margin <hi>turned) him another heart.</hi> There is a twofold turning or changing of the heart, or of a man into another man. Firſt, by gifts of Illumination; Secondly, by the grace of Sanctification; the great change of the heart is that change, of Converſion, by the grace of Sanctification; <hi>Saul</hi> was not turned into another man, nor had he another heart, as changed by Grace (for he ſhewed ſtill his old heart in his new kingly ſtate) but he had <hi>another heart,</hi> or he was another man as chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by gifts; the ſpirit of the Almighty gave him underſtanding for the Government which he was called to; for whereas before he had only a private ſpirit, taken up about cattel and the affaires of husbandry, then God gave him a ſpirit of prudence and valour, a ſpirit of wiſdome and magnanimity, a Noble and an Heroicall Spirit, befitting the Governour of ſo great and populous a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, both in peace and warre. Every Calling is a myſtery, much

They who before were acquainted with his perſon and manner of education, were even amazed at the ſight; And while they were ſurprized with this amazement, <hi>one of the ſame place</hi> (as it ſeemes wiſer then the reſt) <hi>Anſwered and ſaid, but who is their father?</hi> (ver. 12.) That's the ſpeciall word, for which I alledge this text. What? <hi>Saul</hi> among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets! is it not ſtrange that he ſhould be Inſpired! <hi>Then one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid, who is their father?</hi> As if he had ſaid, Doe not any longer ſtand wondering at this thing, but conſider who is the father of <hi>Saul</hi> as a Prophet, as alſo the father of all theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. <hi>Saul</hi> was the ſon of <hi>Kiſh</hi> as to naturall deſcent, but he had another father as he was a Prophet, and ſo all theſe Prophets, had (beſides theit Fathers as men) one and the ſame father as Prophets. Therefore wonder not that ye heare <hi>Saul</hi> prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for all theſe whom ye heare and ſee prophecying, have not theſe gifts by birth from men, nor by induſtry from themſelves, but from God who is a free agent, and inſpireth whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. The ſame God who, by inſpiration, hath freely beſtowed thoſe gifts upon the other Prophets, hath alſo inſpired <hi>Saul</hi> with a gift of prophecy. The Spirit of God is his father (in that capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city) as well as the father of theſe other Prophets. And hence that Scripture runs in the plurall number, <hi>who is their father?</hi> Unleſſe God give power from above, the underſtanding is darke, the memory unfaithfull, the tongue ſtammering; It is light from on high that teacheth the skill of prophecy. <hi>Solomon</hi> had the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt meaſure of underſtanding of any meere man ſince the fall of man, and of him it is ſaid, (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.29.) <hi>God gave Solomon wiſdome and underſtanding exceeding much, and largeneſſe of heart, even as the ſand that is on the ſea-ſhore.

                  <p>From this generall, that the furniture of the underſtanding is the gift of God, or by Inſpiration of the Almighty, take theſe hints by way of Coralary.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If a right underſtanding flow from the Inſpiration of the Almighty, then pray for an underſtanding, pray for the Spirit; <hi>Ye have not becauſe ye aske not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle (<hi>James</hi> 4.2.) God gives wiſdome, but he gives it to them that aske it (<hi>Jam:</hi> 1.5.) <hi>If any man want wiſdome, let him ask it of God, who giveth liberally and upbraideth not.</hi> God upbraideth us not, either with our want of wiſdome, or with the abundance of wiſdome that he is pleaſed to ſupply us with, and give out to us. When <hi>Solomon</hi> was put to his choice what to aske, he ſaid, <hi>Give thy ſervant an underſtanding heart.</hi> God gave <hi>Solomon</hi> wiſdome, but <hi>Solomon</hi> asked it firſt. All good things are ſhut up in promiſes, and the promiſes are opened to give out their good things, when we pray. (<hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5.) <hi>When thou Cryest after knowledge, and lifteſt up thy voyce for underſtanding, then ſhalt thou underſtand the feare of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God. To pray well is to ſtud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e well,</hi> becauſe by prayer light comes in from on high to make ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſucceſsfull, and the worke to proſper in our hand. As the Almighty breatheth downe on us, ſo we muſt breath up to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. To expect and not to pray, is to tempt God, not to truſt him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Doe not onely pray for wiſdome, but uſe meanes, and be induſtrious for the obtaining of it; <hi>The gift of God doth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104248:38"/> not take off the diligence of man.</hi> God doth not worke in us that we ſhould ſit ſtill. (<hi>Prov.</hi> 2.4.) <hi>Then ſhalt thou know wiſdome when thou ſeekeſt her as ſilver, and ſearcheſt for her as for hid treaſure.</hi> And where is this treaſure to be had? Surely in the mines of Scripture, and in all thoſe Appoyntments wherein God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to meete his people, to ſhine upon them and give them the knowledge of his wayes in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Be thankfull for any gift of knowledge; for every beame and ray of light be thankfull; It is God who commands light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, and that God who at firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, dayly ſhineth into our hearts, <hi>to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (2 Cor. 4.6.)</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If underſtanding be from Inſpiration, then they who have received much underſtanding, muſt be caution'd againſt two evills; Firſt, not to be proud, nor high minded; that our gifts come from on high, ſhould make us very low in our owne eyes. <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received, and if thou haſt received it, why doeſt thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?</hi> Theſe are the Apoſtles ſoule-humbling and pride-mortifying que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions or expoſtulations rather (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.) You that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the greateſt gifts, whom the Inſpiration of the Almighty hath made moſt wiſe and underſtanding, be ye moſt humble in your ſelves. Secondly, let me adde (which is another dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous rock upon which great gifts are apt to daſh and ſplit you) take heed of deſpiſing thoſe who have received leſſe; our porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are divided and allotted to us by the hand of God. Divine wiſdome gives us our portion of wiſdome; He that hath moſt, hath no more then God hath given; and he that hath leaſt, hath as much as God is pleaſed to give. They deſpiſe the wiſdome and queſtion the underſtanding of God in giving wiſdome, who deſpiſe thoſe to whom he gives leſſe wiſdome and underſtanding then he hath given to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, To thoſe who have received but little, I ſay alſo two things, by way of caution; Firſt, doe not envie thoſe who have received much; It is of God that they have more then you, is your eye evil becauſe the eye of God is good? Secondly, be not diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with your own leſſer portion; doe not ſit downe ſullen; ſay not, we will doe nothing with what we have received, becauſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104248:38"/> we have not as much as others: we know the doome paſſed on him who having but one talent hid it in a napkin. If we are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content with a little portion, or with one talent, that little is too much, and that one too many for us; nothing doth more dim the glory of God, nor more deſtroy and eate out our own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, then diſcontent; the Devill, ſince his fall, is the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concented ſpirit in the world, and he was not contented while he ſtood, he thought he was not high enough, &amp; that was his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing. They who are diſcontent with the gift of God, looſe what is given, and ſo fall into deeper diſcontent; yea, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes in another caſe (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6.) <hi>into the condemnation of the devill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Then, let us not be lifted up in our owne naturall wiſdome and reaſon, he that <hi>would be wiſe, muſt become a foole,</hi> (1 Cor. 3.18.) untill we ſee our owne wiſdome folly, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attaine the wiſdome of God, or Godly wiſdome.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, This ſhews us the reaſon of the various kinds, and ſeverall meaſures of gifts among the ſons of men. Men differ not more in the meaſures and degrees of their outward eſtates, worldly riches, titles and honours, then they doe in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and degrees of their inward abilities, wiſdome, knowledge, and underſtanding: men differ not more in the feature and figure of their faces, then in the furniture of their minds. One hath five talents, another two, a third but one. And as the various degrees of the ſame gift, ſo diverſities of gifts are from the ſoveraigne pleaſure of God. The Apoſtle is large and very diſtinct in this matter (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 8, 9, 11.) <hi>There are diverſities of gifts, but the ſame Spirit; to one is given by the Spirit the word of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to another the word of knowledge by the ſame S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

And as the Apoſtle ſheweth here the riſe or ſpring of all to be from God, ſo he had ſhewed that the reaſon and intendment of all this is the benefit of men (<hi>v.</hi> 7.) <hi>The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi> What ever your gift is God hath given it for profit and uſe. One hath skill in ſciences, another in languages, one is more

The power of God triumphs over all humane power, and in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane infirmity. So much the Apoſtle teacheth (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27.) <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe, and the weake things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; And baſe things of the world, and things which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed hath God choſen, yea and things which are not, to bring to nought things which are, that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence.</hi> God chuſeth thoſe things which have the greateſt improbility for his worke, that the power and ſucceſſe of the worke may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to him alone. When we chuſe, we ſhould chuſe thoſe that are fit for the worke, to which they are choſen; we ſhould not chuſe a foole to governe, nor one that is of low parts himſelfe to teach others; we ſhould pitch upon the wiſeſt and ableſt we can get. <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid well to <hi>Pharoah</hi> (Gen. 41.33.) <hi>Looke out a man diſcreet and wiſe, and ſet him over the Land of Egypt.</hi> We cannot make men wiſer then they are, and therefore we muſt chuſe and take thoſe that are wiſe to doe our worke. But when God comes to doe his worke, he often takes the fooliſh and the weake, becauſe as he calleth them to, ſo he can fit them for his worke. As the ſtrongeſt oppoſition of nature againſt grace cannot hinder the worke of the Spirit; when the Spirit comes, he will make a proud man humble, a covetous man liberall, an uncleane perſon modeſt and temperate; ſo the weakneſſe of nature cannot hinder his worke.

                  <p>The Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 5.4, 5.) finding ſome very incorrigible and hardned in ſinfull courſes, concluded them meane perſons, and in the loweſt forme of the people. Therefore I ſaid, <hi>Surely theſe are poore, they are fooliſh, for they know not the way of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104248:41"/> Lord, nor the Judgement of their God.</hi> To be poore and fooliſh is very common; theſe are poore and fooliſh (ſaith the Prophet) but ſurely I ſhall finde the Great ones better accommodated with wiſdome; and thereupon he reſolved, <hi>I will get me to the great men, and will ſpeak unto them, for they have knowne the way of the Lord, and the judgement of their God;</hi> That is, theſe great men have had great meanes of knowledge, and we have reaſon to ſuppoſe them as great in knowledge, as they are in place or power. But did the great men anſwer his expectation? did he find that in them, which he ſought and looked for? nothing leſſe: The great men proved more fooliſh, or leſſe in true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge then the poore, as it followeth, <hi>But theſe have altogether broken the yoake and burſt the bonds;</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>I thought theſe great men had been wiſe, but I ſee they are very fooles.</hi> What can be a greater argument of folly, then to breake thoſe yoakes and bonds, which the wiſdome of God hath put upon us? 'Tis both our wiſdome and our freedome to be bound by the moſt wiſe and holy will of God; and hence the Prophet accounts this one as ſtrong as a thouſand arguments, to prove that the Great men among the <hi>Jewes</hi> were not wiſe, becauſe they were not only unwilling to be bound to the obedience of the will of God, but wilfully burſt thoſe bonds. When Jeſus Chriſt came into the world, the great ones, the <hi>Rabbies</hi> had the leaſt true wiſdome, they would not believe on him, nor receive him; yea ſome boaſted of this their unbeliefe as an argument of their wiſdome (<hi>John</hi> 7.48, 49.) <hi>Have any of the Rulers, or of the Phariſees believed on him?</hi> No; they were too wiſe to believe; Faith in Chriſt was left to the fooles, and counted folly by thoſe wiſe men; <hi>But this people</hi> (ſay they, meaning the common ſort or ignorant vulgar) <hi>who knoweth not the Law are curſed.</hi> And they thought them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed becauſe they believed in and received Jeſus Chriſt, the chiefeſt bleſſing. Great men are not alwayes wiſe in civill things, very rarely in ſpirituall things; They have not alwayes the wiſdome of a man, they ſeldome have the wiſdom of a reall Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. They are not alwayes worldly wiſe, or wiſe for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world, much leſſe are they alwayes wiſe for the world which is to come. <hi>Great in title, and wiſe in truth, are a ſweete couple, but ſeldome ſeene.</hi> If ſo</p>

                     <hi>or great in yeares, are not alwayes wiſe.</hi> The Original word may refer to greatneſſe of age, which conſiſts in having lived many yeares, as well as to greatneſſe of honour, which conſiſts in the enjoying of high places and dignities. But I rather adhere to our tranſlation, that the great men here intended are the Great in power and place, not in yeares and dayes, though it be a truth, that ſuch are not alwayes wiſe; and if we take in that ſence alſo, it is a further confirmation of the generall truth in hand, That wiſdome is the gift of God, and therefore thoſe men are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes wiſe, whom vve might moſt probably looke upon as ſuch. For as we ſee Great men, who have the advantage of meanes for education in learning, are not alwayes the wiſeſt; ſo the aged, vvho have that great advantage of time and experience to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vviſdome are not; Both often come ſhort in abilities of underſtanding and prudence, the former of their inferiors, the latter of their Juniors. This is expreſſe in the latter part of the verſe, and therefore needs not be inferred from this firſt part of it, by way of interpretation; <hi>Great men are not alwayes wiſe,</hi> then followes this disjunctive propoſition;
<q>Neither doe the aged underſtand Judgement; <hi>or,</hi> that which is right.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Miſhpat</hi> is taken two vvayes in Scripture; firſt, for the rule of Righteouſneſſe; <hi>Samuel</hi> told the people, the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or manner of the Kingdome, (1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 10.25.) that is, how the kingdome ſhould be ordered and governed, according to judgement and rules of righteouſneſſe. Secondly, Such an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Adminiſtration as is according to that rule of righteouſneſſe, is in Scripture called judgement. The aged doe not alwayes underſtand judgement in either notion; they doe not alwayes
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104248:42"/> underſtand the rule, nor doe they alwayes act according to the rule which they underſtand; they vvho fayle in one, much more in both theſe, doe not underſtand judgement. Sometimes the aged are at a loſſe and know not vvhat to doe, and oftentimes they are ſo entangled with their luſts, that they will not doe vvhat they know. Yet here remember, theſe words are not to be taken as an abſolute negation of vviſdome to the ancient, much leſſe as a reproach upon them: For uſually the aged are moſt underſtanding in judgement, and we may more probably and doe more frequently finde Judgement with them, then among thoſe that are young. And therefore when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>neither doe the aged underſtand Judgement;</hi> his meaning is only this, old age doth not give vviſdome, nor is it the old mans priviledge only, to underſtand judgement.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>As honour or greatneſſe of eſtate, ſo age or greatneſſe of yeares, doth not confer wiſdome upon any man.</q>
                  <p>Time doth neither ſtop nor convey knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; old men have not their knowledge by their Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and therefore, <hi>as no man is wiſe at all times, ſo no man is made wiſe by time.</hi> In ſtrict ſence, vviſdome is not the <hi>daughter of time,</hi> but the <hi>gift of the eternal.</hi> It is not time but divine favour vvhich makes wiſe. They are ſoone made wiſe and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whom God will teach. The teachings of God make young men like the ancients in vviſdome, and without his teaching, the aged are like children in folly.<note place="margin">Intelligentia juris non pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det a ſenectute. <hi>Piſc:</hi>
                     </note> God ſometimes denieth vviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the Ancient, and ſometimes he takes vviſdome from them. And God ſuffers old men to act like children, to goe out of the way, to doe fooliſhly, that he may ſtaine the glory of all fleſh, and that all might both know and have their dependance on him alone. Hence take two or three deductions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From the Connection of theſe two verſes, we learne that, <hi>The ſpirit of God is not tyed to any age or degree of men; The Inſpiration of the Almighty giveth underſtanding; Great men are not alwayes wiſe,</hi> &amp;c. The Spirit of God is a free Spirit; and as the Spirit is free becauſe he moves without any deſert in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; as alſo becauſe he gives liberally, plentifully, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly; ſo the Spirit of God is free as to the choice of objects,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104248:42"/> he gives here and not there, he paſſeth by this man, and takes hold of that, he ſometimes paſſeth by the rich, and takes the poore, (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.15.) <hi>The poore wiſe man ſaved the Citie;</hi> ſometimes he paſſeth by the old, and takes the young; and he doth all this, that we might aſcribe all to himſelfe, not to the age of man, not to any thing in man. God hath promiſed to be with his Church, and with his Miniſters by his Spirit to the end of the world; but the Spirit hath his choice as to particular men, and none have been more deceived then they that thought the Spirit in bonds or tyed to them; <hi>Come</hi> (ſay they, <hi>Jer:</hi> 18.18.) <hi>let us deviſe devices againſt Jeremiah; For the Law ſhall not periſh from the Priest, nor Counſell from the wiſe, nor the word from the Prophet;</hi> The Prieſts are of this opinion, and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> is out of the way, he is a falſe Prophet, and therefore certainly we may proceed in our devices againſt him, for we have the opinion of the Prieſts and Prophets with us; Thus they ſpake, as if the Spirit of God had been bound up to that order. We ought to ſeeke wiſdome at the Prieſts mouth; yet they who reſt upon their vviſdome may ſoone be deceived; knowledge may periſh from the Prieſts mouth, and counſel from the ancient. The great Cheate which the Pope hath put upon the world is, <hi>That the Spirit of God is tyed to the pumells of his Chaire, or that there he cannot erre.</hi> But as particular men, ſo whole Counſells of learned and aged men have erred. True vviſdome is not the birth of time, nor the peculiar of a party, but the free gift of the Spirit of God, who is moſt free, both in what he giveth, and to whom he giveth. Therefore</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Let us not pin our faith or our Conſciences upon men, how great, or how Ancient ſoever they are;</hi> Let us give reſpect to the Ancient, and the honourable, (not to doe it is not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civill but ſinfull) yet let us not give up our Conſciences to them; <hi>For great men are not alwayes wiſe, neither doe the aged underſtand Judgement;</hi> We muſt not reverence any mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the prejudice of the truth. The opinions of great or anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent men are not to be received, as Oracles, without debate; we have liberty to Conſider of them, and to Compare them with the rule: We muſt prove all things, and hold faſt that only which is good.<note place="margin">Quae in philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophia dicuntur ea oportet exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimatione ejus qui dicit detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta, ſeorſum per ſe examinari, Etenim canities dicentis, geſtus ſuperciliſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> faciunt ad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callendum im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritum Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taret de Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditione.</hi>
                     </note> A heathen gave that direction to thoſe who heare philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall diſcourſes; <hi>You muſt take off all thoſe conſiderations which concerne the perſon ſpeaking, and only mind what is ſpoken:</hi> his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,

Believe what is ſaid becauſe you judge it true, doe not believe it true becauſe ſuch or ſuch a man hath ſaid it; becauſe an old man, or a great man, or a good man hath ſaid it. How ſtrictly then and religiouſly is this to be obſerved in hearing the word of God, and the doctrines of faith? in that caſe be ſure to lay aſide all that concernes the ſpeaker, and weigh what he ſpeakes alone and ſingle in the Ballance of the Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Then, <hi>we ought not to deſpiſe what young men ſay, becauſe of their youth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">—Tempora quippe virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem non prima negant, non ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima donant.</note> If old men be not alwayes wiſe, then wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may be with the young; ſometimes an opinion is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued, becauſe it is the opinion of a young man; and truths are not received, becauſe he that delivers them hath not ſeene many dayes. As it is a ſin to adore old age, or to give up our faith and Conſcience to it; ſo it is a ſin to ſlight youth, in doing ſo we may ſlight the truth. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to <hi>Timothy, Let no man deſpiſe thy youth;</hi> Which as it is a Caution to <hi>Timothy</hi> (as hath been ſhewed) to carry himſelfe wiſely and warily, leſt he ſhould oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion others to ſlight or deſpiſe him; ſo it is a Caution to the people, that they ſhould not deſpiſe him becauſe of his youth; That which is the true glory of <hi>gray hayess, doth ſometimes Crowne the youthfull head,</hi> wiſdome (I meane) and ripeneſſe of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.<note place="margin">

                  <p>When God furniſheth young men with abilities, and calleth them to his worke, even old men muſt be willing, at leaſt not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104248:43"/> diſdaine, to heare them. Chriſt muſt be heard in or by whom ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he will ſpeake. God indeed doth uſually ſerve himſelfe by the aged, yet he hath abundantly teſtified that truth is not bound up to old age. Modeſty ſhould bridle young men from being over-forward to ſhew themſelves, but it muſt not ſhut or ſeale up their lips. Old men muſt have the preheminence; <hi>Elihu</hi> ſhewes us that order (<hi>v.</hi> 7.) <hi>I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſaid dayes ſhall ſpeake, and multitude of yeares ſhall teach wiſdome:</hi> We muſt firſt attend and give eare to our elders. And when we are to chuſe Officers or Governours, to chuſe ignorant Greene-heads before knowing Gray hayres, were a perverting of all order. Therefore men of yeares having grace and wiſdome proportionable, are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the younger. In that caſe it were a ſhame to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance young men, with a neglect of the aged. But when God gives more grace and underſtanding to young men then to anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, our approbation ſhould follow his preparation, and whom he qualifies beſt, we ſhould ſooneſt chuſe. <hi>The order of Nature is good, yet not alwayes fitteſt to be obſerved.</hi> Right reaſon and the rule of the word of God muſt ſway and caſt our vote, no the age and yeares of men. When <hi>Samuel</hi> was ſent to anoynt a King in the place of <hi>Saul</hi> among the ſons of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> he looking on <hi>Eliab</hi> ſaid, <hi>Surely the Lords anoynted is before him</hi> (1 Sam: 16.5.) <hi>but the Lord ſaid unto him</hi> (v. 6:) <hi>Looke not on his countenance, or on the height of his ſtature, becauſe I have refuſed him, for the Lord ſeeth not as man ſeeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance; but the Lord looketh on the heart.</hi> Now, as we are not to be taken with the beauty and ſtature of men, ſo not with their gray haires and outward gravity. <hi>Old men are not alwayes wiſe;</hi> wiſdome and a heart for God, a good heart, or a heart to doe good, may dwell with a greene Head, even with a greener then ſeven, the eighth o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It may be queried, to whom did <hi>Elihu</hi> ſay this? We tranſlate the words indefinitely, not determining them to this or thar per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; But the Original ſeemes to ſpeake perſonally; <hi>Therefore I ſaid, heare thou me.</hi> Which may be underſtood two wayes; Firſt, that <hi>Elihu</hi> directed his ſpeech principally to <hi>Job, Heare thou what I ſhall ſay.</hi> Secondly, that <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpake to the whole company there preſent, as if they had been but one man; we may ſpeake in a congregation of hundreds and thouſands, we may ſpeake to many, as if there were but one to heare; as what is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to a few, may be intended to all. (<hi>Mark</hi> 13.37.) <hi>What I ſay unto you,</hi> (my Diſciples) <hi>I ſay unto all, watch.</hi> So that which is ſaid to all, is ſurely ſaid to every one in the aſſembly where 'tis ſaid. Though we take <hi>Elihu</hi> here, as ſpeaking directly but to one perſon, yet we muſt take him as deſiring that every perſon preſent ſhould take it as ſpoken to himſelfe; <hi>Hearken to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note firſt.</p>
                  <q>When any ſpeake reaſon, and hold out truth, they are to be heard.</q>
                  <p>No man ſhould ſtop his eare with a prejudice to the perſon. He that ſpeaks truth, deſerves to be heard: though (as <hi>Elihu</hi>) he be a young man, or inferior to many in age, yet he is to be heard, though inferior to many in power and experience, yet he is to be heard; (<hi>Eccle:</hi> 4.13.) <hi>Better is a poore and wiſe child, then an old and fooliſh King that will not be admoniſhed.</hi> And better is a poore and wiſe child, then an old man that can give no admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As that man is in a ſad condition, whether king or ſubject, that will not be admoniſhed, ſo that man, be he never ſo ancient, is not much to be regarded, that is not able to give admonition. But though both diſcreete young men, and diſcreete poore men are to be heard when they ſpeak truth and reaſon, yet that of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon (Eccle:</hi> 9.16.) is too often verified; <hi>The poore mans wiſdome is deſpiſed, and his words are not heard.</hi> Moſt conclude. if a man be poore, his counſell is ſo too, and if he be young, how can he be a counſeller? yet, <hi>heare me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi>)

                  <p>I will ſhew what my underſtanding is, or what light God hath given me in this caſe. The words are plaine.</p>
                  <p>Note from them.</p>
                  <q>What truth ot truths we have received and know, we ſhould communicate and make knowne.</q>
                  <p>'Tis a duty to ſhew our opinion when we have a call and an occaſion to ſhew it, as <hi>Elihu</hi> here had. Some have knowledge, who will not ſhew it; They (which Chriſt forbids, <hi>Math:</hi> 5.15.) put their candle under a buſhell. God hath lighted a candle, and ſet it up in ſome mens ſpirits, yet they either quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale or much obſcure it. God hath given them a talent of knowledge, and they like the unprofitable ſervant, wrap it up in a Napkin. They will not ſhew their opinion. Not to ſhew what we have, when called to it, is a deniall that we have it. As good not have a candle, or a talent, as let our candle be hid, or hide our talent. The very Heathen condemned this, while they ſayd, <hi>Covered vertue, is buried vertue.</hi> Yea while a man covers his vertues, parts, and abilities, he burieth himſelfe alive, or is dead while he lives. As, the Scripture ſaith, they have only a name to be alive, but are dead, who make a ſhew of more then they have (<hi>Rev:</hi> 3.2.) ſo they have a name to be dead, or may be numbred among the dead, who will not ſhew what indeed they have.</p>
                  <p>There are two things which hinder men from ſhewing their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; Firſt, idleneſſe, they are loath to take the paines to ſhew it. Secondly, ſhamefaſtneſſe; There is a commendable modeſty, 'tis not good to be over-forward in ſhewing our opinion; But that modeſty is ſinfull, which quite hinders us from ſhewing our opinion. They who keepe in their knowledge and opinion either through idleneſſe, or ſhamefaſtneſſe, doe almoſt as ill as they who ſhew their opinion, and declare their knowledge through pride and and high-mindedneſſe, or meerely to ſhew themſelves, to ſhew their wit, and to make a noyſe of their parts and learning. 'Tis ſinfull ſelfe-pleaſing either to know only that we may know, or to publiſh what we know only to be knowne. With ſome 'tis nothing that they have knowledge, unleſſe others
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104248:45"/> know that they have it. An affectation to appeare knowing, is as bad as to be ignorant. <hi>I will ſhew mine opinion</hi> (ſaid <hi>Elihu</hi>) But why would he ſhew it? We have reaſon to judge, it was from the honeſty of his heart, not from the height of his Spirit. And when ever we ſhew our opinion, we ought to ſhew it out of an honeſt heart, and for honeſt ends, ſuch as theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To inſtruct thoſe who are ignorant.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To reduce thoſe who are out of the way.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To feed hungry ſoules with wholeſome doctrine. (<hi>Prov.</hi> 10.21.) <hi>The lips of the righteous feed many.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To ſtrengthen the weake.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, To confirme the doubtfull.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, To comfort the ſorrowfull.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, To encourage the fearefull.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, To quicken the ſloathfull in the wayes and worke of God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, And above all, That God may be glorified by the uſe of the talent that he hath given. (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10.) <hi>As every man hath received the gift, even ſo miniſter the ſame one to another, as good Stewards of the manifold grace of God.</hi> Stewards muſt not ſet up their owne, but their Maſters Intereſt. We ſhould miniſter by every gift as Stewards of the manifold grace of God.</p>
                  <q>I will ſhew mine opinion (<hi>ſaith</hi> Elihu.)</q>
                  <p>But what haſte? <hi>Elihu</hi> it ſeemeth foreſaw ſome ready to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; Why doe you a young man take upon you to ſpeake in a cauſe, wherein ſo many of your Elders and Betters have not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed? why are you ſo buſie? 'Tis much boldnes for you, or ſuch as you to declare your opinion in this controverſie, wherein ſuch wiſe, learned, &amp; godly men have, without ſucceſſe, ingaged alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. To this objection, <hi>Elihu</hi> makes a preventing anſwer, rendring this account of his undertaking; As if he had ſaid, <hi>I have attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved all the paſſages and traverſes of this diſpute, I have heard all that Jobs friends have offered, whether for vindication of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and righteouſneſs of God in laying that great affliction upon him, or for the conviction of Job, to make him ſee his ſin, and ſit downe humbled. I have heard all this</hi> (ſaith <hi>Elihu) and upon the whole matter I find, Job is yet unanſwered, or that there is need of a further anſwer to ſtop his mouth, to ſilence his complaints, and

                  </p>
                  <p>We may learne a good leſſon from the practice of <hi>Elihu;</hi> we ſee he was no idle hearer; yea in him we have the deſcription or character of an active hearer; <hi>I waited for your words, I gave eare to your reaſonings, while ye ſearched out what to ſay.</hi>

                  <q>We muſt diligently heare and give eare, weigh and conſider what is ſpoken, before we give anſwer.</q>
                  <p>No man is well prepared to anſwer, but he that hath been an attentive hearer. And as no man can be a fit anſwerer in poynts under diſputation, ſo no man can be a fruitfull practiſer in poynts of inſtruction, but he that hath been a diligent hearer. 'Tis our duty, when the word is preacht, to waite, not for a ſound of words, not for fine words, or words dreſſed up with affected eloquence, but for ſound ſavory words, for words that have
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104248:47"/> weight and light in them, for words that have ſtrength and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in them, to prevaile upon the heart, and conquer us to obedience. Theſe are the only words, worth the waiting for; and for theſe we ought to waite.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Before <hi>Elihu</hi> comes to give his opinion, he tells <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, that he had diligently heard the matter out, even all their reaſonings and ſearchings.</p>

                  <p>We muſt compare the firſt and laſt, the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning and ending of what is ſayd; We muſt looke quite through. 'Tis not ingenuous to picke up this or that paſſage, to take a piece here, and a piece there; we can never make a true judgement, till the whole is layd together. As, many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly miſtake about the works of God, ſo about the words of men, becauſe they judge the whole by this or that part: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they ſhould judge of the parts by the whole. As therefore we ought not to make concluſions about the providentiall works of God, till the laſt Act, or till all is concluded; ſo we muſt not judge the diſcourſes of men, till the laſt word, or till they have concluded their diſcourſe.

When ſuch proofes and reaſons, ſuch teſtimonies and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities are brought in, as a man can make no exceptions againſt, or cannot evade nor reply to, then he is convinced.

                     <hi>and the evidence</hi> (or conviction) <hi>of things not ſeene.</hi> The Spirit of God makes conviction before faith acts.

The greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction we have to believe, is from authority and teſtimony; yea, that's properly and only faith, when we conſent to a thing upon the teſtimony and authority of another.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The word ſignifies to reprove, or rebuke with words:<note place="margin">

Every mans fault muſt be clearely proved, before he can be juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. Thus the Baptiſt reproved <hi>Herod</hi> (Luke 3.19.) And becauſe Light proves, therefore it alſo reproves (<hi>John</hi> 3.20.) <hi>Every one that doth evill, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved.</hi> The ſame word is uſed (<hi>Eph:</hi> 5.11.) <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitfull works of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104248:48"/> darkneſs, but rather reprove them.</hi> And againe (1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 5.20.) <hi>Them that ſin</hi> (that is, either openly, before all, or whoſe ſin hath been proved before all) <hi>rebuke before all;</hi> and, as the ſame Apoſtle directs (<hi>Tit:</hi> 2.25.) <hi>Rebuke them ſharply.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The word ſignifieth, as to prove and reprove, ſo to chaſten and correct, to rebuke by the hand as well as by the tongue (<hi>Heb:</hi> 12.5.<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Cum ab eo argue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</note>) <hi>Ye have forgotten the exhortation which ſpeaketh unto you as unto children; my ſon, deſpiſe not thou the chaſtning of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him.</hi> When thou art rebuked of him by blowes, or receiveſt ſencible convictions. (<hi>Rev:</hi> 3.19.) <hi>Whom I love I rebuke and chaſten.</hi> Here in the Text we muſt underſtand the word in the firſt ſence. <hi>There is none of you that hath convinced Job;</hi> That is, ye have not proved what ye have ſayd; Ye have called him an hypocrite, and told him that he hath oppreſſed the poore, and detained the right of the fatherleſs; But ye have proved none of theſe evills againſt him. Ye have not proved the matter of fact, that he might ſit downe penitentially confeſſing himſelfe ſuch an offender, as ye have accuſed him to be.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>We can never convince another by what we ſay, untill we prove what we ſay.</q>
                  <p>If we reprove any man for an errour in his judgement, and doe not prove it to be an errour; or if we reprove a man for ſin in practice, and doe not prove his practice ſinfull, or that he hath practiſed that ſin, no conviction follows. What is ſayd and not proved comes to the eare only, not to the conſcience. Therefore ſaith Chriſt (<hi>John</hi> 8.46.) <hi>Which of you convinceth me of ſin.</hi> Find a ſpot in my life if you can. I know you are ready to ſlander me with, but you cannot convince me of evill. It is ſayd of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos</hi> (Acts 18.28.) <hi>He mightily convinced the Jewes.</hi> How did he convince them? not by reproving them only, for not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Meſſias; he did not barely tell them, ye are a company of unbelievers: but he reproved them by proving the neceſſity of their receiving Chriſt the Meſſias, and the evill of rejecting him, <hi>ſhewing by the Scriptures that Jeſus was the Chriſt.</hi> Here was proofe, and ſo conviction followed. He convinced them by authority, by the teſtimony of the word, comparing Scripture
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104248:49"/> with Scripture, the propheſie, with the hiſtory of Chriſt. The Apoſtle would have the Miniſters of the Goſpel mighty at this worke (<hi>Tit:</hi> 1.8.) They muſt <hi>hold faſt the faithfull word, that they may be able by ſound doctrine, both to exhort and to convince the gain-ſayers.</hi> Not only muſt they be able to rebuke gain-ſayers, this will not doe it; they muſt alſo convince them, or <hi>ſtop their mouths.</hi> (James 2.9.) <hi>If any of you have reſpect to perſons, ye commit ſin, and are convinced of the Law as tranſgreſſours.</hi> How doth the Law convince? Not only by reproving, but by proving, It ſhews us a rule, and ſaith, there you have departed from it; here is the line, and there ye have tranſgreſſed, or gone over it. Thus ye are convinced, that ye are tranſgreſſors. He is both wiſe and faithfull, he doth his worke like a workman that needeth not be aſhamed, who not only gives reproofe but proofe, either of error in judgement, or of evill in practiſe. For the cloſe of this poynt, I may ſhew you three great convincers.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The holy Spirit of God; This office of the Spirit Chriſt ſets forth (<hi>John</hi> 16.7.) <hi>I will ſend the Comforter, and when he is come</hi> (what ſhall he doe?) <hi>He will convince the world of ſin, and of righteouſneſs, and of Judgement;</hi> That is, he will bring proofe home to the conſcience, to ſhew ſinners their evill ſtate and evill lives; He will alſo bring home to their ſpirits the alſufficiency of the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo overcome their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, that they ſhall nor be able to refuſe the offers of grace. He will likewiſe ſhew them ſuch reaſons why they ought to be holy, and walke in the wayes of righteouſneſs, that they ſhall neither have power nor will to gain-ſay.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond great convincer, is Conſcience. They who were ſo forward to accuſe the woman taken in adultery (<hi>John</hi> 8.9.) were at laſt <hi>convicted by their owne Conſcience, and went out one by one;</hi> Their conſcience told them they were guilty, if not for that ſin, yet of other ſins as bad as that. They were ſo far before from judging themſelves for, that they tooke no notice of their owne faults; they were ſevere againſt the woman, but they flattered themſelves, till Chriſt made their owne conſciences, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincers. And ſurely conſcience will one time or other convince to purpoſe, They who have refuſed or outſtood conviction by the word, yea and put by the motions of the Spirit, ſhall at laſt find conſcience convincing and ſpeaking home to them.</p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:104248:49"/>
                  <p>The third great Convincer, is Jeſus Chriſt in perſon; Of him in the performance of this office, the Apoſtle ſpeakes clearely (<hi>Jude</hi> v: 15.) <hi>Behold the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of his Saints</hi> (And what comes he to doe?) <hi>To execute judgement upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard ſpeeches which ungodly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him.</hi> Chriſt will make the greateſt of ungodly ones in that great day to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that all their hard ſpeeches which they have ſpoken againſt the Saints, or godly men, were ſpoken againſt him. When prophane men are among their wicked companions, they can jeare at the godly profeſſors of the name of Chriſt, even while they pretend to honour Chriſt; But Chriſt will make them ſee, that they ſco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ned him, while they ſcorned the leaſt of thoſe that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, and believed on his name, The great day will be a day not only of executing Judgement, but of conviction, every mouth ſhall be ſtopped, and all the world of wicked men ſhall become guilty in their owne ſight before God. Theſe are the three great Convincers. The holy Spirit of God, the Conſcience of every man, and Jeſus Chriſt in the judgement of the great day.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Man is very apt to ſpeake boaſtingly, to have high thoughts, and then to utter great words of himſelfe.</hi> Man is a proud piece of fleſh, and a ſmall matter will make him ſhew his pride, and ſpread his plumes (like that naturally-painted bird) if not explicitely in words, yet his ſpirit will ſwell, and be puft up with towring conceits of himſelfe. The Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> deſcribes this temper (<hi>Chap.</hi> 2.4.) <hi>He that is lifted up, his ſpirit is not upright in him; A proud ſpirit is alwayes a falſe ſpirit. They who thinke highly of themſelves, thinke themſelves higher then they are.</hi> And 'tis a great argument that man is naturally very proud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath given ſo many ſtops and checks to his pride, or hath made ſo many proviſions againſt it. The very contrivance of the work of Redemption in that way by the hand of Jeſus Chriſt, had this great deſigne in it; For as the chiefe deſigne in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to man was his ſalvation (that was the ultimate end as to man) ſo there was another deſigne in it, why God would ſave man that way, which the Apoſtle layeth downe (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 1.29.) <hi>That no fleſh ſhould glory in his ſight;</hi> While God intended to give man glory, he took a courſe to cut off all glorying from man. God would not ſet up man againe to worke is owne ſalvation,

Though we are now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>to work out our owne ſalvation</hi> (Phil. 2.12.) yet it is wholly wrought by another; and we are there commanded to work out our owne ſalvation <hi>with feare</hi> and trembling, not with preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and boaſting.</p>
                  <p>Againe, How apt is man to boaſt of any good he doth? ſeeing he is not aſhamed to boaſt ſometimes when he doth evill, and of that which is evill, even of the luſts and luſtings of his evill heart. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.3.) <hi>The wicked boaſteth of his hearts deſire.</hi> And what good is there in the deſire of a wicked mans heart? He (as ſuch) can deſire nothing, but what is worſe then nothing, ſin or vanity, and yet he boaſts of it.</p>
                  <p>Yea, man is ready to boaſt, not only of evill done, but of his ability to doe evill; They in the Prophet boaſted that they <hi>were mighty to drinke wine, and men of ſtrength to mingle ſtrong drinke, (Iſa.</hi> 5.22.) How doe ſome pleaſe themſelves that they are in power, only, becauſe that gives them an advantage to oppreſſe whom they pleaſe, or all thoſe with whom they are diſpleaſed. <hi>David</hi> ſaw that ſpirit ruling and raging in ſpirefull <hi>Doeg</hi> whom he therefore checks, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.1.) <hi>Why boaſteſt thou thy ſelfe in miſchiefe, O mighty man?</hi> The Apoſtle found thoſe (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19.) who <hi>gloried in their ſhame;</hi> That is, in ſinfull practices (even making their belly their God) whereof they ought to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.

                  <p>But eſpecially if bad men doe that which is good, they boaſt of it. A carnal man may for the matter doe good; yea, he may have a zeale for God. <hi>Jehu</hi> ſaid, <hi>Come ſee my zeale for the Lord,</hi> (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.16.) But <hi>Jehu</hi> deſired more to have his zeale for the Lord ſeene, then to be zealous for the Lord. And ſo his was indeed zeale for himſelfe, not for the Lord. The Phariſees did many good things, but they could not fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yea, not only are evill men ready to boaſt of the good they doe, but the temptation lies hard alſo upon godly men to doe ſo, their hearts are often unduely tranſported,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104248:52"/> as with the thoughts of their gifts, parts, and graces, ſo with what they doe through the gift of grace. Our very graces, much more our outward priviledges, may be an occaſion of boaſting. Pride and boaſting are weeds which grow up from the beſt and richeſt ſoyle. 'Tis rare to ſee any man rich in gifts and graces, and poore in ſpirit; poverty of ſpirit is the pureſt and trueſt riches of grace.</p>

                  <q>Man is very prone to make boast of or glory in that which he calleth wiſdome.</q>
                  <p>When he hath found out (though but ſuppoſed) wiſdome, he cannot containe, he muſt cry it up.<note place="margin">Archimedes.</note> It is ſaid of the old <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician,</hi> when (after long ſtudy and beating his braines) he had found out a Concluſion in Geometry, he ran about the Citie (as if tranſported) or raviſhed with this loud out-cry, <hi>I have found it, I have found it;</hi> and thus <hi>Jobs</hi> friends were ready to cry out, <hi>they had found, they had found out wiſdome.</hi> There is indeed a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great temptation in the finding out or attaining of wiſdome, to puff man up, and to make him vaine-glorious. We have great cauſe to be humbled, that we have ſo little wiſdome; and they that have any ſtore (as they thinke) more then their neighbours, are in great danger of being proud of it. <hi>Knowledge puffeth up,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 8.1.) When the head is full, the heart grows high. Yet this is to be underſtood of literall knowledge, not of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or of knowledge when and where it is alone without grace, not of gracious knowledge. The more a gracious man knowes, the more humbl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> he is, becauſe his knowledge ſhewes him his own vileneſs and emptineſs; but the more a carnall man knowes, the more proud he is, became (while ſuch) whatſoever or how much ſoever he knoweth, he knoweth not himſelfe, nor doth he know any thing as <hi>he ought to know it,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeakes there at the ſecond verſe. And as meere naturall men, ſo they who are but ſmatterers, or beginners in the wayes of godlineſs, are alſo very ready to be tranſported with an opinion of their parts and knowledge. And therefore, the ſame Apoſtle gives it in charge to <hi>Timothy</hi> (1 Tim. 3.6.) that he who is called and received
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104248:53"/> unto Office in the Church, ſhould not be a <hi>novice;</hi> he means it not ſo much of one that is young in yeares, as of one that is young in the faith, a new plant in the Church, or one newly converted. And he gives this as a reaſon, <hi>Leſt being puft up</hi> (with pride he meanes) by being in ſuch a function, or by having ſuch reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for wiſdome and knowledge, as is requiſite to a Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Leſt he fall into the condemnation of the devill,</hi> it is as if he had ſaid, <hi>Leſt he be condemned for the ſame ſin that the devill was condemned for, which was pride:</hi> And it was pride (for he is the right father of the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi>) ariſing out of a high opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or conceit of his owne wiſdome, and knowledge. <hi>Zophar</hi> ſayd (<hi>Job</hi> 11.12.) <hi>Vaine man would be wiſe.</hi> But is it an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a mans vanity that he would be wiſe? it is a mans duty to be wiſe, that's a good deſire; why then doth he ſay, <hi>Vaine man would be wiſe?</hi> The meaning is, Vaine man would be in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for wiſdome, he would be reckoned among wiſe men, or he deſires more to be thought wiſe, then to be wiſe. <hi>A vaine man, indeed, cannot deſire any good, but in reference to ſome evill that cleaves to it;</hi> and upon that account he may deſire to be wiſe. The firſt ſin came into the world by an attempt to get wiſdome, or by a proud thought in the hopes of attaining farther wiſdome. The wiſdome which our firſt parents ſought for, was not wiſdome to know God, for that is the moſt excellent wiſdom, <hi>It is eternall life to know God;</hi> So then it was not wiſdome to know God, but it was wiſdome to be <hi>knowing as God</hi> which they affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, they would be high and lifted up above the rate of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in knowledge, and that was their ruine. And I ſhall ſhew (in two things) why there is ſuch a temptation in wiſdome, or the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why when we have found out that which hath a ſhew of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in it, we are ſo forward to applaud our ſelves, &amp; boaſt in it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, 'Tis ſo, becauſe wiſdome is no common Commodity, as I may ſay; wiſdome is but in few hands, if you conſider the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104248:53"/> multitude of men in the world. Now that which few have, all who have it are ready to be proud of. No man is proud of that which is every mans; no man is proud that he is a man, or proud that he hath reaſon, becauſe that is common to all men; but all men are not wiſe, all men are not learned, all men have not an improved wiſdome, reaſon and underſtanding; that hath a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity in it, and therefore of that many are proud.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Wiſdome is not only rare, but very uſefull, and (which reacheth this poynt more fully) very ornamentall; and how apt are we to be proud of our ornaments? A man is not proud of his ordinary Clothes, nor a woman of her every-day dreſſe, but when a man or woman have their ornaments and Jewells on, their Gay-cloathing and rich apparel on, then they are apt to be proud and lifted up, ſo it is in this caſe; Wiſdome is like Gay-cloathing, it is a Jewell, an ornament, and therefore man is under a temptation when he hath any thing of wiſdome, eſpecially any eminency of wiſdome about him, to be lifted up and deſpiſe others: yea, to arrogate great things to himſelfe, and to preſume that he can doe no ſmall matters with his braine, or the engine of his underſtanding. It is a great attainment <hi>to be full of knowledge, and full of humility, high in parts, and lowly in ſpirit; Leſt ye ſhould ſay, we have found out wiſdome.</hi>

                     </gap>hing effectually, only God can. Whatſoever good man doth, God doth it in him and by him. Hence thoſe creature-abaſing and Chriſt-exalting queſtions (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 3.5.) <hi>Who is Paul? and who is Apollo? but Miniſters by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man. Paul</hi> puts a ſlight upon himſelfe, and a ſlight upon all inſtruments, that the whole power might be of God, as he concludes (<hi>v.</hi> 7.) <hi>So then neither is he that plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any thing, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</hi> God only thruſts man downe from his vaine and carnal ſtate, God only lifts him up unto a bleſſed and a heavenly ſtate. This, you ſee, is an improveable interpretation, as the words are ſuppoſed ſpoken by <hi>Elihu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, I rather referre them to <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, being collected or gathered up by <hi>Elihu,</hi> as the iſſue of their whole diſcourſe with <hi>Job. God thrusteth him downe, and not man.</hi> This is it, that you meane (ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi>) this is the top of your wiſdome, the flower and Creame, the ſumme and ſubſtance of all your arguments. All that ye have ſayd is reducible to this one poſition, <hi>God thruſheth him downe, not man,</hi> and therefore he is a wicked man; This is the wiſdome which ye glory to have found.</p>
                  <p>Now though we take the words as the ſumme of what <hi>Jobs</hi> friends had ſpoken, collected and drawne together by <hi>Elihu,</hi> yet there is ſome variety in opening the ſence of them; I will but touch a little at what is offered by ſeverall Interpreters, and ſtay upon that which I conceive moſt proper to the place.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some conceive that in theſe words an account is given why <hi>Jobs</hi> friends gave over ſpeaking, or why they ſtood ſilent, either reſolving to ſpeake no more, or preſuming they had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

                     </note> As if they had ſaid, <hi>We have found out and concluded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our ſelves, that 'tis moſt adviſeable for us, or our wiſeſt way to ſay no more;</hi> you poſſibly thinke we can ſay no more, but we doe induſtriouſly forbear to ſay any more; why ſhould we trouble him any further; God troubleth and vexeth him enough <hi>God thruſteth him downe,</hi> therefore let not man; And therefore we thinke it our wiſdome (having ſayd this) to forbeare and give him over, for we will not adde affliction any longer to the afflicted. So that as the Apoſtle ſpeaks concerning the repenting Corinthian (1 <hi>Epist. Cor.</hi> 2.6, 7.) <hi>Sufficient to ſuch a man is this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was inflicted of many, ſo that contrariwiſe ye ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to forgive him and comfort him, leſt perhaps ſuch a one ſhould be ſwallowed up with overmuch ſorrow;</hi> ſo <hi>Jobs</hi> friends (according to this Expoſition) are brought in ſpeaking the ſame ſence; <hi>Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to him is that puniſhment which hath been inflicted on him by one, even by God, ſo that contrariwiſe we ought rather to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, leſt he ſhould be ſwallowed up with evermuch ſorrow.</hi>

Elihu</hi> told them a little before that none had convinced <hi>Job;</hi> and here they are repreſented, ſaying, we indeed have left him to God, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convincible by us, and therefore, <hi>God muſt thruſt him downe, not man;</hi> there is a truth in this.

                  <p>Thirdly, That which is, I conceive, chiefly intended, take thus; I (ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi>) have undertaken after long waiting and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance to ſhew mine opinion, <hi>Leſt ye ſhould ſay, we have found out wiſdome;</hi> That is, an argument ſo ſtrongly concluding <hi>Job</hi> a wicked man,<note place="margin">Cum Job affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatur &amp; inuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tato modo affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatur, id<expan>

                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The afflictions and thruſtings downe of ſome men are omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently from the hand of God.</q>
                  <p>Every affliction is from God, but ſome are more from God. As God is more viſibly ſeene in the lifting up of ſome men, ſo in the caſting downe of others. Every man that is lifted up, is lifted up by the hand of God; 'Tis the moſt High, who one way or other, ſetteth any man on high; but in ſetting up ſome men on high, his workings are ſo high, that every man may ſee them and ſay, The finger of God is there, the hand of God hath done it. 'Tis thus alſo in thruſting men downe; every affliction, every thruſting downe, is from God, there is a hand of God in it; for as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpake (<hi>Chap.</hi> 5.6.) <hi>Affliction comes not forth of the duſt, nor doth trouble ſpring out of the ground.</hi> Whence then are troubles? Surely they drop downe from heaven; they are from the earth as to the contracting of them, but from heaven as to the contriving of them. Yet there are ſome troubles which fall from heaven more apparently then others doe; That is, there is more of God, more of the hand of God in ſuch a diſpenſation, then there is in others, though there be a hand of God in every one: therefore ſay <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, <hi>God thruſts him downe, and not man;</hi> this mans afflictions are mighty ſtroakes from heaven. For though God hath raiſed up and uſed inſtruments againſt him, yet himſelfe hath appeared moſt againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Thoſe afflictions wherein God doth eminently appeare against a man, ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> to beare the greateſt witneſſe againſt him of his ſinfulneſſe or wickedneſſe.</q>
                  <p>That was the ſcope of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, This is, ſay they, an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable argument, that the man is wicked, becauſe there is ſuch an eminent hand of God upon him. This was the foundation upon
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104248:56"/> which they built all their ſeverall cenſures of him, yea, their hardeſt ſentences againſt him. And there is a faire probability in this way of arguing upon ſoure Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It may be urged, thus; God is juſt, (men indeed are often unjuſt and unrighteous in the evill which they bring upon others; but God is juſt) and therefore he would not lay his hand upon any man in this manner, unleſſe he were a wicked man. Surely his iniquity hath found him out, whom the hand of God hath thus found out.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God is mercifull, he is gracious, (<hi>Lament.</hi> 3.33.) <hi>He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of men.</hi> Now, if God hath declared himſelfe ſo unwilling to grieve the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, ſurely, when we ſee him ſo willingly grieve a man, as he hath grieved this or that man, may we not ſay, he is a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man? Judgement is called Gods <hi>ſtrange worke,</hi> but in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome he acteth as if judgement were his <hi>proper worke,</hi> as if he were in his Element when he is laying heavie ſtroaks on their backs; therefore may we not conclude ſuch among the wicked?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>God is wiſe;</hi> he cannot be deceived concerning any man; therefore there is ſome great reaſon why he afflicts, and what reaſon can more probably be given of a great affliction, then ſome great ſin? As God is ſo true that he will not deceive any man, ſo he is ſo wiſe that he cannot be deceived in any man. He cannot miſſe his mark, nor fall upon a wrong ſubject in his diſpenſations; therefore we have faire warrant to ſay, that a man againſt whom God appeares ſo much, appeares very foule to him, what ever faire appearances he may have among men.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Take this Conſideration alſo, when men afflict their brethren, they often do it either out of reſolved malice, or in heat of revenge; but God cannot do it with ſuch a ſpirit, nor from ſuch principles; <hi>The higheſt acts of revenge in God, are but the awards of Juſtice.</hi> Againe, Men will afflict others out of envie, or to eaſe themſelves; as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of parents chaſtning their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (<hi>Heb:</hi> 12.9, 10.) <hi>We have had fathers of our fleſh, which have corrected us, and we gave them reverence, ſhall we not much more be in ſubjection to the father of ſpirits and live? For they veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a few dayes chaſtned us after their owne pleaſure,</hi> or (as that text may more clearely be rendred out of the original Greek) <hi>as it ſeemed good to them,</hi>

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104248:56"/> ſaid, They will doe it upon their naturall prerogative, or the right of paternity, without giving any account; Yea, a father will afflict and chaſten his child ſometimes (in another ſence) for <hi>his pleaſure;</hi> That is, to vent his paſſion, and eaſe himſelfe: but God never chaſtneth us in paſſion, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ever purely upon prerogative, but with a reſpect alſo to our ſpirituall (which is the beſt) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and for our good. Now among the good things which God aymeth at in afflicting any man, this is nor the leaſt, the purging out of his evills. And therefore when we cannot aſcribe the chaſtiſement of man to man, but to God alone, 'tis a witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, at leaſt, it drawes a ſuſpition upon him of ſome great ſinfulneſs lodged in him, or ſinfull wayes walked in by him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>It is no Concluding argument againſt any man that he is wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe God afflicts him immediately; <hi>or,</hi> how much ſoever the hand of God appeares in an affliction, 'tis no concluding ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt the afflicted.</q>
                  <p>'Tis one principall ſcope intended by <hi>Elihu</hi> in this diſcourſe, to ſhew that there were other cauſes &amp; reaſons of Gods afflicting <hi>Job,</hi> or any man elſe beſides him. And that we ſhould not make Concluſions, that the greateſt ſufferers, are the greateſt ſinners. For firſt, though indeed God threatneth to puniſh the wicked, who wilfully tranſgreſſe his Law, yet he afflicts many, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to wickedneſſe. Secondly, though God threatens the wicked only or chiefely at leaſt, yet he reſerves a liberty to try the innocent; yea, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, <hi>He laughs at the triall of the innocent;</hi> And therefore the moſt innocent are moſt tryed. I have had occaſion more then once to ſhew why they are moſt or ſo much tryed. Firſt, for the exerciſe of their faith; Secondly, for the improvement of their patience; thirdly, to humble them; Fourthly, ſometimes to ſet them up for examples to others; as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks (<hi>Chap.</hi> 5.10.) <hi>Take my Brethren, the Prophets, who have ſpoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of ſuffering affliction and of patience.</hi> The Prophets have ſuffered affliction, and God hath let them ſuffer, that they might be patternes of ſuffering; and 'tis ſo in many other inſtances; Fifthly, God doth it to mortifie their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Sixthly, to prevent future tranſgreſſions, he hedgeth up their
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104248:57"/> way with thornes; Seventhly, to diſcover or gaine a teſtimony of their ſincerity. They ſerve Chriſt to purpoſe, who can ſuffer while they ſerve, and bleed under his croſſe, while they ſweat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his yoke. Surely then, there is no concluding againſt any man that he is a ſon of <hi>Behal,</hi> or hath caſt off the yoke of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt burdeneth him with his croſſe. Yet this was the great <hi>Maxime,</hi> which <hi>Jobs</hi> friends inſiſted upon, He muſt needs be a wicked man, becauſe the Lord had thruſt him downe, not man.</p>
                  <p>But when we ſee good men thruſt downe by the hand of God, there is a better uſe to be made of it, then to judge them, and that is to be watchfull over our ſelves, leſt we put a rod into the hand of God to chaſten us, or a ſword into his hand to wound us. For as Chriſt ſpake (<hi>Luke</hi> 23.33.) <hi>If it be thus done to the greene tree, what ſhall be done to the dry?</hi> If Chriſt ſuffered ſo much, who was a greene flouriſhing fruit-bearing tree, what may we who are dry and barren trees? Or take the meere ſons of men, ſome of them comparatively to others, are as greene trees flouriſhing in grace and holineſſe, who yet are under ſore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; and if this be done to a greene tree, what ſhall be done to thoſe who are but dry barren fruitleſs trees, yea, trees that bring forth evill fruit. The Apoſtle (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17.) gives a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table caution; <hi>If Judgement begin at the houſe of God</hi> (he does not ſay at the Temple of Idolls, But if it begin at the houſe of God) <hi>what will the end be of thoſe that obey not the Goſpel!</hi> Let others looke to it when they ſee God afflicting his people, when they ſee God bringing ſuch troubles into his owne houſe, what troubles may they expect, who are indeed but a den of theeves, and whoſe houſes are, yea who themſelves are as a Cage of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane birds? Thus we ſee the great argument diſproved, which <hi>Jobs</hi> friends uſed to prove him wicked, becauſe <hi>God did thruſt him downe, not man.</hi> And, ſaith <hi>Elihu,</hi> this is it you ſay and boaſt of, as your wiſdome; but indeed you have not convinced <hi>Job,</hi> no not by this. What you have taken for a demonſtration, is but a fallacy. And though I might wave mine owne trouble in ſhewing that it is ſo, becauſe I am not the man (but ye are the men) to whom <hi>Job</hi> hath ſhaped his whole diſcourſe, yet I cannot forbeare to doe it, only I promiſe you, I will not tread in your ſteps, nor take up your method in doing it.

                     </note>One of the Ancients Commenting upon this text, ſaith, <hi>Elihu</hi> diſcovers pride in this ſpeech, <hi>He hath not directed his ſpeech a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me;</hi> As if <hi>Elihu</hi> diſdained to take notice of what was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to them; which (ſaith he) is the humor of a proud man; who lookes not upon himſelfe as engaged by any thing ſpoken,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104248:58"/> unleſſe you ſpeak perſonally and directly to him; whereas Chriſt ſpeaking perſonally to his Diſciples only, would yet have all men ſee themſelves ſpoken to (<hi>Mark</hi> 13.34.) <hi>What I ſay to you, I ſay to all, watch. Elihu</hi> ſhould have taken what <hi>Job</hi> ſpake to his three friends, as ſpoken to all that were preſent, and ſo might well enough have ſpared this complement, as my Author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives. But I paſſe that as a curioſity; Eſpecially becauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares plainly enough, that <hi>Elihu,</hi> though the words were not ſpoken directly to him, yet did take himſelfe to be much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; and therefore riſeth up as a Moderator in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie between <hi>Job</hi> and his three friends. <hi>He hath not directed his words againſt me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Neither will I anſwer him with your ſpeeches.</q>
                  <p>I will not goe your way,<note place="margin">Mihi integrum eſt reſpondere &amp; quidem lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, aliter &amp; ex alio fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, licet me di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectè Jobus non oppugnaverit. <hi>Scult:</hi> Non ſequur vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as veſtrasin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondendo, ſed alias efficacio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res inveniam. <hi>Aquin:</hi>
                     </note> nor follow your example in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; I ſhall proceed upon other principles, and uſe other medium's then ye have done; ſuch, I hope, as will be found much more effectuall, and attaine their end. We may take theſe words;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will not anſwer him with your ſpeeches,</hi> two wayes; Firſt, as their ſpeeches had too little light of reaſon in them; Secondly, as their ſpeeches had too much fire of paſſion in them. As if he had ſayd, I will uſe milder words and ſtronger arguments; I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſapprove the courſe you have taken with him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will neither inſiſt upon your theame to condemne him for an hypocrite, nor uſe your argument to prove it, becauſe God hath thus ſorely afflicted him; for I hold that a meere Sophiſme. <hi>I will not anſwer him with your ſpeeches;</hi> That is, with ſpeeches which have ſo much paſſion, and ſo little true reaſon in them, as to the poynt in hand. For though <hi>Jobs</hi> friends had ſpoken many things of much weight and reaſon conſidered abſtractly, or in <hi>Theſi,</hi> yet when it came to the <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> as appliable to <hi>Jobs</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall caſe, then their ſpeeches had little or no weight in them. So that in this profeſſion <hi>Elihu</hi> ſeemes to promiſe theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That he would uſe ſtronger arguments then they had done; I will not uſe yours, that is, weake ones, I purpoſe to come better prepared to the Combate then you; For though <hi>Elihu</hi> doth ſometimes uſe ſuch arguments as they, yet he doth not uſe them to their end to prove that <hi>Job</hi> acted rebelliouſly, or like a
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104248:59"/> wicked man againſt God, as they did: but to ſhew, that he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himſelfe too highly, or over-confidently towards God. And this (as it appeares by the iſſue) tooke more upon <hi>Job</hi> then all his friends hard ſuſpitions, charges, and accuſations. This hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him, this ſilenced him; he had nothing to returne, but ſate downe convinced; and therefore <hi>Elihu</hi> dealt with him in more ſtrength of reaſon and divine authority then they had done.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will not anſwer him with your ſpeeches,</hi> he ſeemes to engage that he would deale mildly, with him, or without paſſion; he would not uſe bitter words, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and argue the matter gently and meekly. For though <hi>Elihu</hi> gave <hi>Job</hi> many ſevere reproofes, yet alwayes in a more friendly manner, not to prove that he had done wickedly, but to convince him that he had ſpoken overboldly; or that while he was ſo zealous to defend his own innocency, he ſometimes intrencht upon the ſoveraignty of God, in his eager and earneſt deſire of pleading his cauſe before him. And ſurely it was but need that <hi>Job</hi> ſhould have a man of a milder temper ſent in to ſpeake to him, elſe his ſpirit might have been quite over-whelm'd and ſunke. Nor was it without the ſpeciall hand of God, that after this poore afflicted ſoule had been ſo hardly uſed, and ſo grievouſly cenſured by thoſe rigid diſputants, he ſhould at laſt meere with a man more meeke and compaſſionate, in ſome meaſure, to mittigate and allay his ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In that <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will not anſwer him with your ſpeeches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>It is not good to imitate others in any thing they doe or ſpeake which is not good.</q>
                  <p>We muſt not either act or ſpeake by example, but by rule, or by example only ſo farre as it anſwers the rule. 'Tis dangerous treading in their ſteps who tread awry. When <hi>Paul</hi> found that <hi>Peter</hi> did not goe right, he was reſolved not only not to follow him, but to reprove him (<hi>Gal.</hi> 2.14.) Thus ſaith <hi>Elihu,</hi> here I will not write after your Coppy, nor take up directions from what you have done, for I ſee you have gone and done amiſſe.</p>
                  <p>Againe, When <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will not anſwer him with your ſpeeches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:104248:59"/>
                  <p>Note Secondly.</p>
                  <q>What we ſpeake ſhould be our owne ſence, not the ſence of others, unleſſe their ſence, either of things or perſons, be the ſame with ours.</q>
                  <p>Some pin their opinion upon the ſleeves of others, and they will be juſt of the judgement of ſuch a man; what he ſaith, they will ſay. As ſome expect that every one ſhould be of their Judgement, and ſay as they ſay; they are <hi>many Maſters</hi> (which the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> forbids, <hi>My Brethren, be not many Maſters,</hi> doe not take upon you to give the rule to all others, ſome are proud at this rate, they thinke themſelves able to give the rule to all men) ſo not a few are ſo eaſie, that preſently they will take up any thing as a rule from any Maſter; whereas we ſhould not be ſo apt to follow, but labour to have the Judgment or reaſon of things in our ſelves, rather then to take it up upon truſt. When <hi>Luther</hi> was much troubled about the dealings of God in the world, to ſee how matters went, and was ſaying within himſelfe, Surely it were better things were carried thus and thus; while <hi>Luther</hi> (I ſay) was thus troubled, he thought he heard this word of reproofe from God; <hi>O Martin, Martin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Martine, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, in valde ſapis, ſed ego non ſum deus ſequax.</note> 
                     <hi>I ſee thou art very wiſe, thou canſt give rules, even to God himſelfe, but I am not a God eaſie to be led by men. I will not take thy Counſell, though I ſee thou haſt an honeſt heart in what thou counſelleſt. I have a way of my owne, and I will have my owne way, though the world, yea, though good men, and my owne faithfull ſervants are grieved and mourne at it.</hi> Man would appoint to God himſelfe, but God will not model matters by mans wiſdome, nor in his way. Thus in the preſent caſe (I only allude) it is not good for us when we heare what others ſay, preſently to receive it, or take the impreſſion from them; and ſo anſwer in their words, or vote their opinions, though they are wiſe and good men; <hi>Elihu</hi> takes the liberty to diſſent, as in his opinion, ſo in his Method of proceeding with <hi>Job,</hi> I will anſwer, but it ſhall not be with your ſpeeches, I will take my owne courſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>The faylings and miſtakes of others, ſhould be our warnings not to doe the like.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> obſerved where they miſſed as to the matter in hand,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104248:60"/> he obſerv'd alſo wherein they miſſed, as to the manner of proceeding; and he obſerved both well, and wiſely to avoyd the like inconveniences; and thereupon profeſſed, <hi>I will not anſwer him with your ſpeeches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Note.</p>
                  <q>We ſhould anſwer to every poynt and perſon with reaſon and ſweetneſſe, not with paſſion and bitterneſſe.</q>
                  <p>There is no convincing others with wrath; <hi>The wrath of man</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>works not the righteouſneſſe of God, (James</hi> 1.20.) That is, wrath will never bring about nor effect thoſe righteous things, or ends, which God would have us ayme at. The wrath of man puts him quite out of the way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, both out of the way of right ſpeaking, and of right act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. To ſhew much reaſon, and little paſſion, is our wiſdome. So the Apoſtle gives the rule (2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 2.26.) <hi>The ſervant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive;</hi> he doth not meane it of bodily ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; As if he had ſaid, he muſt not be a fighter. As when the Apoſtle ſaith (1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3.3.) <hi>A Minister muſt not be a ſtriker;</hi> It can hardly be thought he ſhould intend only, if at all, that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhould not be like groſsly boyſterous men, who are not ſo much as Civill in their behaviour; ſurely ſuch are farre enough off from a fitneſs to be received into the Miniſtry; therefore ſome expound the Apoſtle to the poynt in hand, he muſt be no ſtriker with his tongue in paſſion, anger, and wrath, no word-ſtriker. There is great ſtriking, yea, wounding with words. Though Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters muſt ſtrike and wound with the authority of God, yet not with their owne animoſities. They muſt wound the conſciences of ſinners, with the Word and Spirit of God, but not with their own wrathfull ſpirits; ſuch ſtrikers they may not be, nor may the ſervant of the Lord ſtrive thus, <hi>but be gentle to all men, apt to teach,</hi> yea, patient in teaching. It is a great exerciſe of patience to teach, with line upon line, precept upon precept; When we ſee little received or heeded, yet to inſiſt upon it, this is pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; <hi>In meekneſſe inſtructing ſuch as oppoſe themſelves, if God peradventure will give repentance to the acknowledgement of the truth.</hi> As the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> exhorts (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.21.) <hi>to receive the word with meekneſſe;</hi> that's a moſt neceſſary rule in hearing the word; for many times the hearer is in a paſſion, there is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104248:60"/> ſuch a ſtorme in his bowels that he cannot heare to purpoſe, therefore if any would receive the ingraffed word, they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it with meekneſſe. I ſay alſo the word ſhould be given out or ſpoken <hi>in meekneſs,</hi> though not with coldneſſe; I doe not ſay with coldneſſe or with a ſlightneſs of ſpirit, but with meekneſſe. And the truth is, milde ſpeaking or meekneſſe of ſpeech (as to the ſpirit and conſcience of the hearer) is not only moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, but moſt prevailing. Meekneſſe ſhould be ſhewed, even where there is the greateſt zeale; and zeale then prevailes moſt, when there is moſt meekneſſe in it. The Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, <hi>Of ſome have compaſſion, making a difference, others ſave with feare;</hi> That is, ſave them by preaching that which may make them afraid, ſcare them out of their ſins; but yet ſtill this is to be done in a ſpirit of meekneſſe. (<hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1.) <hi>If any one be over-taken in a fault</hi> (what then? rayle on him, rage againſt him, and revile him, no, but ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ye that are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, reſtore ſuch a one with the ſpirit of meekneſſe; conſidering thy ſelfe, leſt thou alſo be tempted.</hi> Bones muſt be ſet (to that the word which we tranſlate <hi>reſtore</hi> alludes) with a tender hand. Thoſe three things which are required in a good Chirurgion, or Bone-ſetter, are as neceſſary in a reprover, or in him that would reduce another from the error of his way. Firſt, He muſt have an <hi>Eagles eye,</hi> to diſcerne where the fault or fayling is. Secondly, A <hi>Lyons heart,</hi> to deale freely with the faulty, how great ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they are. Thirdly, A <hi>Ladies hand,</hi> to uſe them gently and tenderly. All which will more fully appeare, while</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, From the example of <hi>Elihu,</hi> we collect and learne, that a good Moderator or compoſer of differences, muſt avoyd five things. Firſt, ſlightneſs of ſpirit and of ſpeech. It is not good to ſpeake lightly of little things, but it is a ſhame to ſpeake lightly of great things. Weighty matters muſt be handled weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, and we ſhould put not a little finger, but our ſhoulders to them! Secondly, paſſionateneſs of ſpirit and of ſpeech, muſt be avoyded. That which hinders reaſon, had need be ſhut out while we are reaſoning. What a contradiction in the adjunct is it, to heare of an angry moderator? or to ſee a man ſet himſelfe to compoſe differences between others with a diſcompoſed ſpirit of his owne. Thirdly, partiality in ſpeaking, or the favouring of a party muſt be layd aſide; for as <hi>Elihu</hi> did not ſpare to tell
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104248:61"/> 
                     <hi>Jobs</hi> friends their owne, ſo neither did he ſpare to tell <hi>Job</hi> his owne, he was not partiall on either ſide. What can be imagin'd more uncomely, then that he who ſtands between two ſhould leane to any one? or that he who comes to be an umpire or a Judge, ſhould make himſelfe a party or an Advocate. Fourthly, he muſt avoyd timorouſneſſe, and not be daunted with what man ſhall ſay or can doe againſt him, while he is doing his duty. <hi>The feare of man is a ſnare</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) That man had not need be in a ſnare himſelfe, whoſe buſineſs it is to bring others out of the ſnares of error, whether in opinion or in practiſe. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he muſt beware of an eaſineſs to be drawne aſide, either by the perſwaſions or applauſes of men. A Judge between others muſt keepe his owne ſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre concerning theſe two verſes, wherein <hi>Elihu</hi> is ſtill carrying on his Preface, to prepare <hi>Job</hi> to receive attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what he had to ſay. In the next place, <hi>Elihu</hi> turning to the ſtanders by, ſignifies to them in what condition he found <hi>Jobs</hi> friends.</p>

                     <hi>Job</hi> waited hoping they would ſpeak ſomewhat worthy of themſelves, worthy of that opinion and reputation which they had in the world for wiſdome,<note place="margin">Stare pro ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</note> but they deceived his expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, He could not have nor heare a word more from them. This <hi>Elihu</hi> puts into a parentheſis <hi>(for they ſpake not, but ſtood ſtill, and anſwered no more)</hi> He uſeth many words to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to ſhew that there was ſomewhat extraordinary in their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; <hi>They ſpake not, their tongues ſtood ſtill.</hi> As ſpeech is the image of the mind, and from the aboundance of the heart, ſo it is by the motion of the tongue. If the tongue ſtand ſtill, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is ſtayd. Their mouths were ſtopt, as being either unable or aſhamed to urge their accuſations and arguments any further. <hi>They ſtood ſtill and anſwered no more.</hi> It is ſaid of thoſe forward accuſers of the women taken in adultery (<hi>John</hi> 8.9.) <hi>That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Convicted by their owne Conſcience, they went away one by one;</hi> they ſhrunke away, having not a word to reply; And ſo did <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, who while they ſtood ſtill, carried it as men unwilling to be heard or ſeene any more upon the place. <hi>They were amazed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:104248:62"/>
                  <p>Firſt, Hence note.</p>
                  <q>Amazement unfits us for argument.</q>
                  <p>Where wondering begins, diſputing ends. <hi>They were amazed, they anſwered no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>The ſame men are ſometimes ſo changed, that they can ſcarcely be knowne to be the ſame men.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſayd (<hi>Chap:</hi> 4.2.) <hi>Who can withhold himſelfe from ſpeaking?</hi> He was ſo forward that he could not be kept from words, but now he had not a word in his keeping, ſpeech was withheld, or departed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>Falſe grounds or poſitions, cannot be alwayes maintain'd.</q>
                  <p>God will ſupply both matter and forme, arguments and words, to confirme his owne truth; they who are in the right, ſhall not want reaſon to back it: but they who are in the wrong, may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find a ſtop, and have no more to ſay. The Apoſtles were weake, becauſe unwilling in a bad cauſe (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 13.8.) <hi>We can doe nothing against the truth, but for the truth;</hi> and they who are willing to be againſt the truth, ſhall be weake and not able long to doe any thing againſt it <hi>(They ſpake no more) As God gives a banner,</hi> (that is, outward power) <hi>to them that feare him, that it may be diſplayed, becauſe of the truth</hi> (Pſal: 60.4.) So he gives wiſdome and underſtanding (that is, inward power) for the maintaining of the truth. <hi>In thy majeſty ride proſperouſly becauſe of the truth</hi> (Pſal: 45.4.) As Chriſt who is truth, and the giver forth of truth, ſo they who are undertakers for truth, ſhall ride and proſper. Truth may be borne downe by power, and out-fac'd by impudence, but it cannot be overcome. <hi>Never feare to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a good Cauſe; and ever feare to undertake a bad one, for it will be ſlur'd at laſt.</hi> Truth may be oppoſed, but truth-defenders ſhall never be aſhamed, nor want a tongue to ſpeake for it. Chriſt (<hi>Math:</hi> 10.17.) warnes his Diſciples what entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they were like to find in the world; <hi>They ſhall deliver you up to Rulers, ye ſhall be brought before Governours and Kings for my ſake;</hi> But he withall encourageth them; <hi>Take no thought
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104248:63"/> what ye ſhall ſpeak, or what ye ſhall anſwer.</hi> For ſome might ſay, What if we ſhould be called in queſtion for the truths of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel? we are willing to burne for them (as that Martyr ſaid) b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t we feare we cannot diſpute for them. Well, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>take no thought what you ſhall ſpeak, for it ſhall be given you in the ſame houre.</hi> God himſelfe by his Spirit will prompt you, he will whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſuch things into your eares, as all your oppoſers ſhall not be able to gainſay. Indeed we ſee ſome men of corrupt minds, and reprobate concerning the truth (as the Apoſtle gives their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter) who have courage enough to ſet forth lyes, and ſlander the truth, who ſtraine their wits to the utmoſt, and (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeakes, (<hi>Jer:</hi> 9.3.) <hi>bend their tongues like their bow for lyes.</hi> But let them remember what the Apoſtle ſayd of ſuch as they (2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3.8.) <hi>Now as Jannes and Jambres withſtood Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo doe theſe alſo reſiſt the truth;</hi> but (<hi>v.</hi> 9.) <hi>they ſhall proceed no further, for their folly ſhall be made manifeſt to all men;</hi> That is, ſhortly all ſhall ſee that theſe men have but playd the fooles: we may ſay of all thoſe who hold wild taunting opinions, they ſhall proceed no further, though they act highly againſt the truth now, yet ſtay but a while, and they will have nothing to anſwer or returne, they will have emptied their quiver, and quite ſpent their powder, you ſhall heare no more of them.</p>
                  <p>From that 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, where <hi>Elihu</hi> addeth, <hi>I waited (for they ſpake not but ſtood ſtill, and anſwered no more)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Firſt.</p>
                  <q>It is our wiſdome and our duty to ſtay our time before we put our ſelves out upon buſineſs.</q>
                  <p>It is good to wait; God himſelfe is not haſty upon us, he waits to be gracious, and we muſt wait our ſeaſon to be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; <hi>Elihu</hi> did not preſently engage. The providences of God, and the Exigency of things, muſt put us on, we muſt not put our ſelves on. Chriſt tells us (<hi>Math:</hi> 9.38.) <hi>The harveſt is great, and the labourers few, pray therefore the Lord of the harveſt that he would thruſt forth labourers into his harveſt;</hi> he doth not ſay, <hi>pray that labourers would thruſt forth themſelves into the harvest,</hi> or run into it before they are ſent, but pray the Lord of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt that he would thruſt forth labourers; that is, that he would powerfully encline their hearts to the worke, whom he hath
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104248:63"/> fitted and prepared for it. And as untill we are, at leaſt, both competently prepared, and fairely enclined to that or any other good worke, 'tis beſt for us to waite; ſo when once we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and enclined, 'tis beſt for us, without delay, to ſet upon the worke; <hi>Elihu</hi> did ſo, as appeares in the next verſe.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>Now <hi>Elihu</hi> addreſſeth to his worke, his duty; and in this with the verſes following to the end of the Chapter, we have, firſt, his reſolvedneſſe to ſpeak, <hi>I ſaid I will anſwer for my part,</hi> &amp;c. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, his ability, readineſs and furniture to ſpeake (<hi>v.</hi> 18.) <hi>For I am full of matter,</hi> &amp;c. Thirdly, we have the motives that preſt him to ſpeak, or that he was exceedingly preſt to it in the latter end of the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, as alſo <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20. <hi>My ſpirit within me Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth me. Behold my belly is as wine which hath no vent,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will ſpeake that I may be refreſhed.</hi> Fourthly, in the two laſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he tells us what caution, yea what conſcience he meant to uſe in ſpeaking (<hi>v.</hi> 20.) <hi>Let me not I pray you accept any mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: neither let me give flattering titles unto man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <q>I ſaid I will anſwer for my part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Now you have done, I will begin; thoſe words, <hi>I ſaid,</hi> are not in the Hebrew text explicitely, yet are well underſtood. I will anſwer <hi>for my part,</hi> that is, (as ſome conceive, the force of the phraſe) I will anſwer with my ſtrength, and might, I will put my ſhoulders to it; but better Grammarians conclude,<note place="margin">Illud quod ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui partem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretantur pro mea virili parte aut pro viribus, latinè potius dictum eſt, quam ad germanant vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis ſignificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem. <hi>Pined:</hi>
                     </note> that the word imports, A mans ſhare or portion in any worke to be done, rather then the ſtrength which the workman uſeth or puts forth in doing it. And ſo the ſence is plaine, as if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid, they have done their part, they have gone to the utmoſt of their line; now I ſee it falls to my turne to ſpeak, and I will do what falls to my turne, <hi>I will anſwer alſo for my part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>I alſo will ſhew my opinion.</q>
                  <p>We had theſe words in the negative at the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; There <hi>Elihu</hi> ſayd, <hi>I was afraid and durst not ſhew you my opinion;</hi> But here, as alſo before (<hi>v.</hi> 10.) <hi>Elihu</hi> had taken courage and was
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104248:64"/> reſolved to <hi>ſhew his opinion.</hi> I ſhall not ſtay upon any opening of this clauſe, only I ſhall note two or three things briefely from it; as connected with the former verſe. There we had <hi>Elihu</hi> wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, here we have him purpoſing to ſpeake.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>They who conſider and waite before they ſpeake, ſpeake moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailingly, moſt weightily.</q>
                  <p>It was long ere <hi>Elihu</hi> ventured to ſpeake, but when he did, he did it to purpoſe and with full effect. That which comes from our owne heart, is moſt like to take upon the hearts of others; they ſpeake as much from their hearts as with their tongues, whom we ſee long waiting before we heare them ſpeaking. And therefore, it is not good, no not for good ſpeakers, to be ſpeaking before they have been waiting; many through haſt bring forth untimely births, and unripe fruit; <hi>Elihu</hi> could ſay, <hi>I have waited,</hi> before he ſayd, <hi>I will anſwer for my part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>We ought to obſerve order in ſpeaking, and act our proper part.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will anſwer for my part</hi> (ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi>) or my turne is come to anſwer. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gives this rule at large (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 14.28, 29, 30.) He would have no Interruption, no confuſion in Church-meetings, or Church-ſpeakings.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When he ſaith, <hi>I will anſwer alſo for my part, I alſo will ſhew mine opinion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>He that hath received a gift or talent, ſhould make uſe of it, and not hide it.</q>
                  <p>It is good to be doing our part, and ſhewing our opinion where we may be uſefull. Some love to act other mens parts rather then their owne, and to intrude into Provinces which are not theirs. But whatſoever our hand findes to doe (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Eccl:</hi> 9.10.) that is, whatſoever is, as <hi>Elihu</hi> here calls it, our part, that we ſhould doe <hi>with all our might.</hi> More was given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout uſing our talent and ſhewing our opinion at the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of this Chapter, whether I referre the reader.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Elihu</hi> was here but an auditor, not a diſputant, not
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104248:64"/> a party, he came in only upon the by; yet having received a word he utters it.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>Every man ſhould thinke himſelfe Concern'd to ſpeake for the truth, when 'tis wronged, and doe his best to right it.</q>
                  <p>Or we ſhould take all occaſions and ſeaſons of doing good by our words as well as by our workes. As it is not good to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <q>What others fayle in, we ſhould labour to ſupply in the cauſe of God, and for his truth.</q>
                  <p>It is a proverbiall ſpeech among the Hebrewes;<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Elihu</hi> proſecutes the ſame thing in another way; and to ſhew how troubleſome it was to refraine ſpeaking any longer, his thoughts being not only too many, but too working to be encloſed in ſo narrow a roome as his owne breaſt, he compares them to wine, or to new wine, which will either find or make its way out.</p>
                  <p>The whole ſimilitude is exceeding elegant, Firſt, he compares his thoughts, or the matter he had in his mind to wine. Secondly, he compares his ſoule or ſpirit to bottles, his inward man was the veſſell that held this wine. Thirdly, he compares his long ſilence to the ſtople or Corke of the bottle. Fourthly, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares that trouble and griefe of mind which this forbearance to ſpeake brought upon him, to the working which is in a bottle ſo ſtopt, or having no vent. Fifthly, he compares his intended ſpeaking to the opening of the bottle which gives it vent.</p>
                  <q>Behold, my belly is as wine; <hi>that is, the thoughts of my belly</hi> are as wine.</q>
                  <p>The Chaldee Paraphraſe ſaith, <hi>as new wine,</hi> which is full of ſpirits, and being ſtopt is ready to breake the bottle; which ſhews the mighty force which <hi>Elihu's</hi> thoughts had upon him, they would out, there was no ſtopping of them. Chriſt ſaith, (<hi>Math:</hi> 9.17.) <hi>No man putteth new wine into old bottles,</hi> but men put new wine into new bottles; why? becauſe they are ſtronger, and ſo more fit to preſerve the wine; <hi>My belly is as wine.</hi>

                     </note>The word which we render <hi>bottles,</hi> is never uſed in Scripture elſewhere in this ſence, but it is often uſed to ſignifie Wizards, or ſuch as have familiar Spirits (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 8.19. <hi>Iſa:</hi> 29.4.) becauſe they who uſed thoſe helliſh arts by compact with the Devill, did ſpeak out of their belly, &amp; ſo as it were, out of a bottle. Now, ſaith <hi>Elihu, My belly is as new wine that hath no vent, and it is ready to burſt like new bottles;</hi> even new bottles will break, unleſſe the new wine have ſome vent. And becauſe though new bottles be ſtronger then old to keepe in wine, yet the wine may be ſo ſtrong as to breake them, therefore <hi>Elihu</hi> here-by ſhewes that his deſire or neceſſity of ſpeaking was ſo urgent upon him, that though he ſhould ſtrengthen himſelfe, yea ſtrive with himſelfe as much as he could to refraine from ſpeaking, yet ſpeake he muſt.</p>
                  <q>I am full of matter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Obſerve, Firſt.</p>
                  <q>A man ſhould not ſpeak, eſpecially in weighty matters, till himſelfe be well ſtored with matter.</q>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>When ſome veſſells are drawne quite dry, and inſtruments ſpent and worne to the ſtumps, when they can neither doe nor ſay any more, then God fills up and furniſheth others for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</q>
                  <p>There was not a drop more to be ſqueez'd out of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends; but <hi>Elihu</hi> was a full bottle (<hi>Mal:</hi> 2.15.) there is a reſidue of the Spirit; God hath more Spirit or ſpirituall abilities to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of, and beſtow then he hath yet diſpoſed of to, or beſtowed upon any one or all the ſons of men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>God can furniſh Inſtruments with proper gifts for the worke which he Calls them to.</q>
                  <p>Here was a man Cut out on purpoſe for this worke, he was Clothed with a ſpirit of prudence and courage, as well as with a ſpirit of diſcerning. We have a wonderfull Example of this in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104248:66"/> 
                     <hi>Luther,</hi> who came forth againſt all the powers of the papacy. What a ſpirit had he? his was a ſpirit of might, his ſpirit Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him, his belly was like a bottle full of new wine, there was no ſtopping of it. Others would have been daunted and cowed downe with the tenth of that oppoſition which he met with, but he was bold as a Lyon, who turneth not aſide.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Why did <hi>Elihu</hi> come forth? why did his ſpirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine him? what made his belly like wine? Some charge him with pride and arrogancy of ſpirit, as if he did it out of vaine oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſhew his parts and gifts, to ſet himſelfe above thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Worthyes who had dealt and diſcourſed with <hi>Job</hi> before. But we have reaſon enough (conſidering what he ſpake, and what the iſſue of his ſpeaking was) to determine, that he was moved with a zeale for God, and to doe good to <hi>Job,</hi> not with a ſpirit of pride, to ſhew his learning, wit or wiſdome among men; and therefore we finde that when the whole matter was brought to an iſſue, and God himſelfe came to deale with <hi>Job</hi> and his three friends, God commends <hi>Job,</hi> and reproves his three friends, but there is no reproofe upon <hi>Elihu.</hi> Now for as much as God himſelfe doth not charge him, what hath man to doe to charge him? Not only charity but reaſon and judgement command us to thinke his deſigne honeſt, and his aymes ſincere, while he profeſſeth under ſo vehement an impulſe or impreſſion upon his ſpirit to engage and ſpeake in this matter.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Thirdly.</p>
                  <q>To ſee truth ill handled, ſhould fill our ſpirits with much zeal for God.</q>
                  <p>That was it which drew <hi>Elihu</hi> to this engagement, he ſaw thoſe men (though good men) had put a diſguiſe upon the things and dealings of God; and if men diſguiſe the truth, and maintaine error, if they deface the doctrines of faith and pure worſhip, with their owne phanſies and falſe gloſſes, it ſhould kindle a holy fire and fervour of ſpirit in us, to aſſert and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the truth. Our ſpirit within us (in all ſuch caſes) ſhould Conſtraine us.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly: In that <hi>Elihu</hi> was ſo Conſtrained and preſſed in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as wine which hath no vent, or as a woman with Child ready to travell.</p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:104248:67"/>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>It is a paine not to ſpeake when we have much to utter, and much minde to utter it.</q>

                        </gap>hu</hi> was full he had a Conſtraint upon him to vent his opinion. <hi>David</hi> ſaith (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 39.1, 2, 3.) <hi>I held my peace, even from good words;</hi> (he did not only forbeare idle and evill diſcourſe, but refrain'd from good) but it was a trouble to him not to ſpeak, eſpecially not to ſpeak good words; therefore he adds, <hi>My heart waxed hot within me. Jeremy</hi> found it no eaſie worke to keepe in words; yea, he deſcribes himſelfe as much pained by not delivering his minde, as a woman is when not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in child-birth (<hi>Jer:</hi> 20.9.) <hi>Then ſaid I, I will not make mention of him, nor ſpeak any more in his name, but his word was in my heart as a burning fire ſhut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not ſtay.</hi> There was wine, new wine in his belly, yea there was a fire within him; as we may be weary with ſpeaking, ſo with not ſpeaking, or forbearing to ſpeake, (<hi>Jer:</hi> 4.19.) <hi>My bowels, my bowels, I am pained at the very heart, my heart maketh a noiſe in me, I cannot hold my peace.</hi> Read him in the like trouble upon the ſame occaſion (<hi>Jer:</hi> 6.11.) <hi>Eliphaz</hi> (Chap: 4.2.) was thus preſſed, <hi>Who can withhold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from ſpeaking?</hi> 'Tis a great paine, to be mind-bound, or not to deliver our mind, when our mindes are full and we full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to deliver it.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, When he ſaith, <hi>I am Conſtrain'd, I am like a bottle ready to burst,</hi> It teacheth us.</p>
                  <q>The Spirit of God doth ſo over-power ſome men, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not containe.</q>
                  <p>The Phariſees and high Prieſts, thought to ſtop up the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, thoſe bottles full of the new wine of the myſteries of Chriſt, and therefore gave them Counſell, yea a command to ſpeake no more in his name. At the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, they ſaid of ſome in a common ſence, <hi>Theſe men are full of new wine,</hi> that is, they are drunken; but the truth was, they were full of the Spirit, full of Goſpel-truths, and like bottles full of new wine they could not hold. And when the Phariſees and high Prieſts would have ſtopt up thoſe bottles, and charged them that they ſhould ſpeak no
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104248:67"/> more in the name of Jeſus; they anſwered, <hi>Whether it be meet to obey God or man judge ye; for we cannot but ſpeak the things that we have ſeene and heard:</hi> you may cut out our tongues if ye will, take away the organs of ſpeech ye may, but otherwiſe we cannot but ſpeak. As it is ſaid of Chriſt, they could not reſiſt the Spirit by which he ſpake; ſo they were not able to reſiſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rir by which the Apoſtles ſpake. Some have ſuch Impulſes from the Devill upon them, that they cannot but ſpeak boldly as well as wickedly and blaſphemouſly; it is ſtrange to ſee what ſome both old and new Impoſtors have done, their bellyes have been like bottles full of new wine, they have even burſt to vent their wicked opinions.<note place="margin">Eſuris &amp; ſuit auditores qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus omne quod ſentit effundat, quibus qual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To open the lips is a preparation to ſpeaking; Chriſt opened his mouth and ſpake; ſpeaking is begun with opening the mouth; a man may open his lips for other ends then for ſpeaking, and a dumbe man opens his lips who cannot ſpeake, yet no man can
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104248:68"/> ſpeak without opening his lips: and why did <hi>Elihu</hi> open his lips? it was to refreſh himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>He that ſpeaks his minde, eaſeth his minde.</q>
                  <p>'Tis good to ſpeak to refreſh our ſelves, but 'tis much better to ſpeak for the refreſhing of others; yea, we ſhould ſpeak. (though to our own paine) that we may refreſh others, and ſpeak away their paine (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 50.4.) <hi>Thou haſt given me the tongue of the learned, to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary;</hi> They are good words indeed which refreſh both the ſpeaker, and the hearers. But the deſigne of ſpeaking is rather for the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of hearers, then of the ſpeaker. How vainly then doe they ſpend their breath in ſpeaking, who ſpeak without any deſigne of good, or of refreſhing, either to themſelves or others, who ſpeak only to be applauded and taken notice of, to be cryed up and commended for eloquent ſpeakers. Theſe are ſad deſignes of ſpeaking; better be a ſtammerer, then ſuch an Orator, better be dumb and not able to ſpeake, then to ſpeak for ſuch ends, with greateſt ability. Unleſſe we ſpeak, that others may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, converted, comforted, edified, ſaved, ſome way or other bettered, we were as good hold our peace and ſay nothing. The holy Apoſtle profeſſed (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 14.19.) <hi>I had rather ſpeak five words with my underſtanding, that I might teach others alſo, then ten thouſand words in an unknowne tongue.</hi> To ſpeak ſtrange words in an unknowne tongue, may gaine us a name among men; But neither are any ſoules gained, nor doth any ſoule gaine the worth of one farthing in ſpirituall knowledge by hearing thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and ten thouſands of words ſpoken in an unknowne tongue. We ſhould thinke all thoſe words even as loſt to us, by which we have not, at leaſt, intended the gaine and good of others. But ſuppoſe, while we ſincerely intend the good of others in ſpeaking, they get no good by what is ſpoken; yet it ſhall not be without good to us: for as <hi>Elihu</hi> here hoped, ſo may we to be refreſhed by it; for <hi>when a man hath diſcharged his duty to God and man, in ſpeaking his mind, it cannot but be a great eaſe to his minde. Elihu</hi> had a great duty upon him, to moderate and ſet this buſineſſe right between <hi>Job</hi> and his friends, to take downe that height of ſpirit that was in <hi>Job,</hi> and to allay that ſharpneſſe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104248:68"/> and bitterneſſe of ſpirit that was in his friends. When we have in ſincerity diſcharged our duty to all others, and done that which our Conſciences charge upon us, how doth it quiet and refreſh our minds? and how many have been burdened and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted in their ſpirits for neglecting this duty: They (I ſay) who neglecting to ſpeake when it was incumbent upon them to ſpeak, and the cauſe of God required it, have found it a burden upon them long after. When <hi>Mordecai</hi> had acquainted Queene <hi>Eſter</hi> with the ſad condition of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> (whoſe deſtruction <hi>Haman</hi> had plotted) and adviſed the meſſenger to <hi>charge her, that ſhe ſhould goe in unto the King to make ſupplication unto him, and to make requeſt before him for her people</hi> (Eſt: 4.8.) She returned him anſwer by the ſame meſſenger, that ſhe could not doe this without running the hazzard of her owne life (<hi>v.</hi> 10, 11.) yet <hi>Mordecai</hi> replyed (<hi>v.</hi> 14.) <hi>If thou Altogether holdst thy peace</hi> (let the danger be what it will) <hi>at this time, then ſhall their enlargement and deliverance ariſe to the Jewes from another place, but thou and thy fathers houſe ſhall be deſtroyed: and who knowes whether thou art come to the kingdome for ſuch a time as this?</hi> As if he had ſayd, It is thy duty to ſpeake for thy people at ſuch a time as this, and therefore if thou doeſt not breake through all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to ſpeake, thy ſilence will coſt thee deare, probably thou wilt looſe thy owne life by it, or if not, then certainly thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will trouble and vex thee for it as long as thou liveſt.

               <p>Firſt, He would not doe otherwiſe, becauſe he could not with any content to himſelfe. It was againſt the very graine of his ſpirit to doe otherwiſe; his diſpoſition lay a quite contrary way, he was a man of another genius or temper, a man of another mould and make, then to doe ſuch low and unworthy things, as accepting the perſons of, or giving flattering titles unto men. He is expreſſe in this (<hi>v.</hi> 22.) <hi>I know not to give flattering titles.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, He would not becauſe he durſt not <hi>give flattering titles, nor accept the perſons of men.</hi> The danger and dammage he ſhould incurre by doing ſo, kept him from doing ſo, as wel as his owne indiſpoſition to it.

And it is uſuall to put the face, or the countenance for the perſon, becauſe the face declares the perſon and ſhews who the mans is; and it is elegantly expreſſed by the face, becauſe accepting of perſons, importeth a reſpect to others for their outſide, or in conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104248:70"/> of ſome externall glory. <hi>Let me not accept the face of any man, or perſon,</hi> let him be who he will. The originall word <hi>iſh,</hi> moſt properly ſignifieth an eminent, or honourable man, a learned or wiſe man. As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſayd, I will not accept or lift up the face of a man, though he be <hi>(iſh)</hi> a man never ſo much lifted up, and exalted above his brethren. To accept the perſon of a man, is not a fault in it ſelfe; for as our perſons are accepted of God, ſo ought our perſons to be accepted with one another; yea, it is a duty to accept the perſon of a man; that is, to give him favour, honour, and due reſpect. Not only civility and humanity, but reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it ſelfe calls us to give outward reverence to them who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and are ſuperior, either to others of our ſelves. God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is ſayd to accept the perſons of his people firſt, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> their ſacrifices or ſervices. And we ought to accept the perſons of men according to their differences in place and power, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally according to thoſe gifts and Graces, which ſhine in them. Therefore when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let me not, I pray you, accept any mans perſon,</hi> his meaning is, let me not doe it in prejudice to the cauſe or truth that is before us. Then we are properly and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſayd <hi>to accept perſons,</hi> when in any matter, buſineſſe, or poynt of controverſie, our eyes are ſo dazel'd or blinded by external appearances, that we have reſpect rather to the perſon of the man, then to the matter, or the truth of the cauſe in hand. So then, this ſin of accepting perſons, is alwayes committed when we are more ſwayed by, or when there is more attributed to perſons then to things, that is, when the mans worth is more looked to then the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th or merit of his cauſe; or further, when ſomething in a perſon which hath no reſpect to the goodnes, or badnes of his cauſe, moves us to give him more or leſſe then is meete, this is ſinfully to accept or reſpect a perſon. Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> acquits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from all thoſe bonds and blinds which his reſpect to thoſe worthy perſons before him, might lay upon him. They were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and grave men, they were wiſe and good men, he had a great reſpect for them, he owed much reverence to them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering their age and gravity, their degree and dignity; yet he owed a greater reſpect to God, and to the truth, then to their perſons, and was thereupon reſolved, (though he had many and great temptations to doe it,) <hi>not to accept the perſons of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:104248:70"/>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>To accept perſons in prejudice to the cauſe or truth before us, is a high offence both to God and good men.</q>
                  <p>'Tis ſo in a double notion; Firſt, in the act of it, becauſe we doe that which in it ſelfe is not right, nor according to the mind of God. Secondly, in the iſſue, conſequence or effects of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by reſpecting perſons, we are endangered to many other ſins. While <hi>Solomon</hi> only ſaith (<hi>Prov:</hi> 28.21.) <hi>To have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons is not good;</hi> his meaning is, 'tis very evill, 'tis ſtarke naught. And the reaſon which he gives of the evill of it, is not only becauſe the act in it ſelfe is evill, but becauſe the iſſue and conſequence of it is worſe; For, (ſaith that Scripture) <hi>for a piece of bread that man will tranſgreſſe;</hi> That is, he that reſpects perſons, will turn aſide from Juſtice, for his owne advantage, though it be very ſmall, even for a piece of bread. The Prophet complaines of thoſe (<hi>Amos</hi> 2.6.) <hi>who ſold the righteous for ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the poore for a paire of ſhoes.</hi> They who have ſold or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up themſelves to this crooked Spirit of reſpecting perſons, will not ſticke to ſell both the perſons of the righteous, and the moſt righteous cauſes, not only (as the Prophet ſaith) for a paire of ſhoes, but (as we ſay) for a paire of ſhoe-buckles. <hi>They will ſoone judge, amiſſe of things, who have reſpect to perſons, and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes looke beſide the cauſe, who looke too much upon the face;</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould weigh with us in judgement, but truth or right, and that in a five-fold oppoſition.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Truth and right muſt weigh with us in oppoſition to relation. When a Brother, or a neere kinſman be in the cauſe, we muſt not decline, nor be biaſſed from the truth, yea though it be on his ſide to whom we have no relation, but that of <hi>man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We muſt keep to the truth, and doe juſtice in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to friendſhip. Though he be my friend, my old friend, and my fathers friend, I muſt not reſpect him, if truth ſtand upon the other ſide, upon the ſide of the meereſt ſtranger. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſayd, <hi>Socrates is my friend, and Plato is my friend,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Amicus Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Amicus Plato, ſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis amica ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas.</note> 
                     <hi>but truth is more my friend, and therefore I will ſtick to that.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We muſt hold to truth, in oppoſition to or notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the hatred of men; ſuppoſe a man beares us ill will, yea in other things hath wronged us, yet if his preſent cauſe be
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104248:71"/> righteous, we muſt doe him right: We may not bring in our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular wrongs or quarrells upon any cauſe, but that about which the wrong or quarrel riſeth. They ſhew the pureſt love to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, who act righteouſly towards thoſe that hate them, and will not wrong thoſe who have attempted to oppreſſe and ruine them. A true lover of Juſtice will do to others as himſelfe would have others doe to him, yea though they have not done to him, as they would be done to.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We muſt ſtand to truth in oppoſition to riches and worldly aboundance; riches uſually find more friends and favourers, then righteouſneſſe doth. And 'tis uſuall to favour the rich more then the righteous. How often is truth on the poore mans ſide over-ballanced by his adverſaries purſe. But O how poore are they in ſpiritualls and morals, who thus reſpect the perſons of the rich!</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, We muſt judge for truth in oppoſition to worldly greatneſs and power; and that in a two-fold conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Though men have a power to reward, and preferre us, to doe great things for us, yet this ſhould not draw us aſide; woe to thoſe who reſpect the greatneſſe of the perſon inſtead of the goodneſſe of the cauſe: yet how many are there who care not how bad a great mans cauſe is, if he will but engage to do them good: yea ſome great men look upon themſelves as much undervalued, if they be not favoured in their cauſe (how bad ſoever it be) becauſe they are able to doe them good who favour it. <hi>Balak</hi> tooke it very ill at <hi>Balaams</hi> hands, when he ſeemed unmoved by his ability to advance and reward him. <hi>Did not I earneſtly ſend for thee, to call thee? Wherefore cameſt thou not to me, am I not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble indeed to promote thee to honour?</hi> (Numb: 22.37.) And wilt not thou ſerve my intereſt, when I have ſuch a power to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance thine? Thus alſo <hi>Saul</hi> thought all muſt cleave to him, and forſake the cauſe of <hi>David,</hi> becauſe he was great and could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre them (1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 22.7.) <hi>Will the ſon of Jeſſe give every one of you fields, and vineyards, and make you all Captains of thouſands, and Captains of hundreds?</hi> Hath he any great places to beſtow, and honours to give? Why then doe ye ſeeme to adhere to him and his party. Hope of reward makes a great bias upon ſome mens ſpirits, and carrieth them quite off from truth.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſecond conſideration prevailing much with many
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:104248:71"/> in this matter; for though they are unmoved by rewards, and will not bite at the bayte of ſelfe-advancement; yet, ſay they, O he is a great man, and hath great power, he may do me a ſhrewd turne, he may vex me and undoe me, he may ſit upon my skirts hereafter and ruine me. Thus where hope doth not, feare may carry a man from reſpect to right to the reſpect of perſons. But know, That be a man never ſo great, and able to doe me a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, yet truth muſt be maintained and Juſtice be done, though we ſhould be quite undone by appearing for it. It hath been ſayd of old, <hi>Let juſtice be done, though heaven fall;</hi> much more ſhould it be done, though we for doing and abetting it fall to the earth. <hi>Moſes</hi> gave that charge more then once (<hi>Levit.</hi> 19.15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.16, 17.) <hi>Thou ſhalt not reſpect the perſon of the poore, nor honour the mighty, but in righteouſneſſe ſhalt thou judge thy neighbour.</hi> Againe, <hi>Ye ſhall not reſpect perſons in Judgement, but ye ſhall heare the ſmall as well as the great, you ſhall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgement is Gods;</hi> neither undue pity to the poore, nor carnal feare of the great (which two often doe) ought to put any check or ſtop to the execution of Juſtice. So in that excellent model of inſtructions which <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> gave his Judges (2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 19.7.) <hi>Wherefore now let the feare of the Lord be upon you, take heed, and doe it; for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor reſpect of perſons, nor taking of gifts.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Do not you reſpect perſons, for God reſpects no perſons; he is no gift-taker, therefore be ye no gift-takers; your duty is to give every one his due. That which is right to one man is right to another, either in the ſame, or in any paralel caſe; That which is the rich mans right in his cauſe, is the right of the poore man in his cauſe;<note place="margin">Quod uni ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quum eſt, non debet alteri in eodem caſu eſſe iniquum.</note> yea it is as ſinfull not to have a due reſpect to the rich man in his caſe, as not to have reſpect to the poore man in his. Then all ſorts and degrees of men are judged righteouſly, when there is no regard had or notice taken in Judgement, of what ſort or degree any man is. <hi>Judges are called gods, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould act like God without reſpect to men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as this is a truth in all thoſe caſes of judgement, where Magiſtrates ſit in the place of God, ſo it is as true in all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate judgements and determinations of brethren concerning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or things, which (by way of diſtinction from the former) is commonly called the putting or referring of a matter in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:104248:72"/> 
                     <hi>to men.</hi> We muſt take heed in private judgements, that we be not ſwayed according to the condition of perſons, nor muſt we make the fault great or leſſe, the cauſe better or worſe, becauſe the perſon is greater or leſſe, friend or ſtranger to us. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle gives this counſel and caution to the Churches (<hi>James</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.) <hi>My Brethren, have not the faith</hi> (that is, the doctrine of faith or profeſſion) <hi>of our Lord Jeſus, the Lord of glory, with reſpect of perſons; For if there come into your aſſembly a man with a gold ring, and there come in alſo a poore man in vile rayment, and you have reſpect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and ſay unto him, ſit thou here in a good place, and ſay to the poore, ſtand thou there, or ſit here under my footſtool: are ye not then partiall in your ſelves, and are become judges of evill thoughts.</hi> In admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the things of God which are ſpirituall, we muſt obſerve no civill difference, no diſtinction among men. Chriſt hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alike and equally to rich and poore, bond and free, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as to Church-priviledges and enjoyments, they muſt all be alike, and equall unto us. No man is to be knowne after the fleſh in the things of the Spirit (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5.16.) that is, no man is to be valued meerely, upon natural or worldly accounts; if we doe, then (as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> concludes in the place laſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>efore mentioned) <hi>are we not partiall in our ſelves?</hi> that is (as ſome alſo tranſlate that reproving queſtion) <hi>Have we not made a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi> a groundleſſe difference, or a difference grounded upon carnal reſpects, rather then upon any ſolid reaſon; and ſo as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the cloſe of the verſe, <hi>are become judges of evill thoughts,</hi> that is, have made our judgement of thoſe perſons, according to the dictate of our owne evill and corrupt thoughts, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rule of the word.</p>
                  <p>Further, this ſin of reſpecting perſons, is found alſo in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary converſe of men; For when we caſt favours upon thoſe that are ill deſerving, and commend thoſe (as we ſay) to the skies, who ſhould rather fall under our ſevereſt cenſure, and are led to doe all this alſo, becauſe the perſon is a kinſman or a friend; for though (<hi>eaeteris paribus,</hi> other qualifications and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances being equall) we are to reſpect friends and kindred, who are our owne fleſh, before ſtrangers, yet vertue and worth ſhould out-weigh relations, and (as <hi>Levi</hi> in doing Juſtice, <hi>Deut:</hi> 33.9.) ſo we in beſtowing rewards, <hi>ſhould not acknowledge our
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:104248:72"/> Brethren, nor know our owne children;</hi> but let ſuch have our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards who beſt deſerve them.</p>
                  <p>I may adde this alſo, To take up this or that forme of religion, becauſe ſuch and ſuch perſons are in it, and to reject another, though better, becauſe none but a few that are deſpiſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned are in it, is a moſt dangerous way of reſpecting perſons. This was the meaning of that queſtion (<hi>John</hi> 7.48.) <hi>Have any of the rulers, or of the Phariſees, believed on him?</hi> As if certainly that muſt alwayes be the beſt way and rule of believing, which is profeſſed by the rulers? Or as if it were ground enough to reject a way of religion becauſe the common people or the poore are moſtly found in it. Thus, 'tis ſtoried of a Great Prince that was converted to the Chriſtian faith, and reſolved to be baptized, that ſeeing a great many poore men in his way as he went, he asked to whom they belonged; it was anſwered they were Chriſtians, and of that religion which he was entring into; what, doth Chriſt keep his ſervants ſo poore? (ſayd he) I will not ſerve ſuch a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and ſo drew backe, even while he was but ſetting his face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt. I might inſtance the ſinfullneſs of accepting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in many other particular caſes, as well as theſe, but theſe may ſuffice for a taſt. <hi>Let me not</hi> (ſaith <hi>Elihu) accept any mans perſon,</hi>
                     <q>Neither let me give flattering titles unto man.</q>
                  </p>

                     </note> Firſt, <hi>I will not uſe a preface,</hi> or, <hi>I will not ſtand prefacing with man.</hi> Flatteries are uſually ſet forth in affected Prefaces and Apologies. Secondly, <hi>Let me not change names before men;</hi> or, <hi>let me not ſpeak to man under a borrowed name;</hi> That is, let me ſpeake plainly and clearly without ambages and fetches; let me ſpeake to every man, and about every thing by its owne name, and not with covered words, as if I were unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to touch thoſe to whom I ſpeake. Our tranſlation is yet more cleare to the ſcope and tendency of this place; <hi>I will not give flattering titles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſentence is but two words in the Hebrew; The verbe ſignifies (ſay the Rabbins) to <hi>hide,</hi> or <hi>conceale,</hi> or to carry a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cloſely and obſcurely; and they give the reaſon of it, becauſe in flattering there is a hiding of what men are, and a ſhewing of what they are not. The word ſignifieth alſo to give a <hi>nicke name</hi> or a <hi>by-name,</hi> and ſo the ſence is; I will not give ſecret reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor gird at any man upon the by; <hi>Jobs</hi> friends had done ſo ſometimes, though they after ſpake explicitely and directly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Further, the word ſignifies the giving of <hi>any additionall title.</hi> Thus I finde it uſed in the Prophet (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 44.5.) <hi>One ſhall ſay, I am the Lords:</hi> (ſpeaking how perſons ſhall flow into the Church) <hi>and another ſhall call himſelfe by the name of Jacob: and another ſhall ſubſcribe with his hand unto the Lord, and ſirname himſelfe by the name of Iſrael: He ſhall ſirname himſelfe;</hi> that's the word here uſed, he ſhall take up that title, that illuſtrious title, he ſhall liſt or enroll himſelfe among the people of God, and thinke it his honour and glory <hi>to ſirname himſelfe by the name of Iſrael.</hi> The word is ſo uſed againe (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 45.4.) <hi>For Jacob my ſervants ſake, and Iſrael mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have ſirnamed thee, though thou hast not knowne me.</hi> It is ſpoken of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I have given thee a glorious title; God did not only name <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but gave him a ſirname, he called him, <hi>Cyrus my ſervant, and Cyrus mine anoynted.</hi> Thus the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to give a title, or a ſirname; now there are ſirnames or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of two ſorts; Firſt, diſgracefull and reviling ones, juſtly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to, but commonly by vile men. Secondly, Honorable and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing ones. And theſe are of two ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Such as are true and well deſerved, many by the great acts which they have done, have purchaſed ſirnames; <hi>Alexander</hi>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:104248:73"/> King of <hi>Greece,</hi> for his Warlike valour and ſucceſſes, was called <hi>The Great;</hi> And among The Romans <hi>Scipio</hi> after his victories over the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> was ſirnamed <hi>Africanus.</hi> The Romane Hiſtories ſupply ſundry examples of this kind. And when in Scripture <hi>Paul</hi> is called an <hi>Apostle, Peter</hi> an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> They well deſerved theſe honorable Titles, becauſe as they were meerely of Grace, immediately called and ſent of God, to publiſh and plant the Goſpel all the world over, ſo they laboured aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly in it, and by their miniſtery ſubdued and conquered the world to the faith and obedience of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are alſo titles and ſirnames, which are meere pieces of flattery, there being no worth in the perſon that may juſtly deſerve them. 'Tis not ſinfull to give titles, but as we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate <hi>to give flattering titles unto men.</hi> We ſhould call men as they are, and as they deſerve; <hi>I will call a ſpade a ſpade,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi>) he that is good I will call him good, and he that is bad I will call him bad; and that which is ill done I will ſay it is ill done; <hi>Let me not give flattering titles unto men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Flattery is iniquity: to give flattering titles unto men is to tranſgreſſe the Law of God.</q>
                  <p>Some will not give true and due Titles to any man; The moſt truly honorable perſons and higheſt Magiſtrates, ſhall have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from them but <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee. Jacob</hi> a holy and a plaine man, yet called his owne brother, <hi>My Lord Eſau,</hi> (Gen. 32.4. Gen: 33.8.) <hi>Luke</hi> The Evangeliſt called <hi>Theophilus, Moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi> (Luke 1.3.) And <hi>Paul</hi> ſtiled <hi>Festus, Moſt Noble</hi> (Acts 26.25.) Now as they erre upon one extreame, who will not give true titles, ſo doe they on the other, who give (which <hi>Elihu</hi> here diſclaimes) flattering titles. There is a two-fold flattery.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, In promiſes.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, In praiſes.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Some are full of flattery in promiſes, they will tell you of great matters which they will doe for you, yet meane no ſuch thing. Thus (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.36.) The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> dealt with God, when in the time of their ſtraights and calamities they promiſed to doe great and good things, they would turne to the Lord and ſerve him; <hi>Nevertheleſſe</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>they did flatter him
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:104248:74"/> with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues; for their heart was not right with him,</hi> &amp;c. Thus many upon their ſick-beds, or in a day of trouble, what promiſes will they make? How deeply will they engage for duty, if God will reſtore them? how holy and zealous and upright will they be? they will leave their former ill courſes, and yet all is but flattery, they really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it not. 'Tis flattery in promiſes to God, when there is not a purpoſe in the heart to doe what we ſay, but only to get our ends upon him; And we deale no better many times by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; men in ſtreights will promiſe any thing, and when they have gained enlargement, performe nothing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a flattery in praiſes, and that's here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed againſt. This flattery in praiſing hath a double reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To the actions of men. 'Tis flattery to call that act good that is nought,<note place="margin">Multi ſunt qui vitia virtuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus vicinis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtare conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt &amp; viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um omne palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant adumbrata nomenclatura è vicino ſubjectae virtutis. <hi>Baſil: in Pſal: 61.</hi>
                     </note> that juſt that is unrighteous; To put ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of vertue upon thoſe things that are vicious, to call that which is indeed a covetous act, a thrifty one, and to call that act which is cruell, juſt, at moſt but ſtrict or ſevere, this is to flatter men in what they doe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a flattery of perſons, as to what they have and are, when we ſpeake more of them then is in them, when we ſpeake highly of them, who are low in all abilities and attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. How groſſely doe they give flattering titles, who blow up very Ideors with a conceit of their learning, who extoll fooles for wiſdome, and commend the wicked as vertuous, yea recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them as patternes of vertue.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould give honour to all men to whom it belongs; but we are not to flatter any man, for that belongs to no man. (<hi>Rom:</hi> 13.7.) <hi>Render therefore to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, custome to whom cuſtome, feare to whom feare, honour to whom honour.</hi> There is an honour that belongs to men with reſpect to their degrees, when none belongs to them with reſpect to their qualities. He that is very honorable as to his place, may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any honour as to his worth, yet he muſt be honoured as much as his place comes to. And as there is an honour due to thoſe that are above us, ſo there is an honour due to thoſe that are our equalls, yea to thoſe that are our inferiours, and below us. The Apoſtle gives that direction more then once; we have it firſt (<hi>Rom:</hi> 12.10.) <hi>Be kindly affectionate one to another, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104248:74"/> preferring one another.</hi> The people of God ſhould be ſo farre from an ambitious affectation of preheminence above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that they ſhould f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eely and really (not as many doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementally) give others the preheminence, and offer them the upper place or hand; The grace of humility, doth not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid us to exalt our ſelves above our betters, but it alſo (in many caſes) bids us ſet our ſelves below thoſe whoſe betters we are. One of the Ancients hath made three degrees of this kind of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. The firſt is, when we make our ſelves inferior to our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals; The ſecond, when we make our ſelves but equal to our inferiors; The third, when we make our ſelves inferior even to our inferiors, and leſſe then thoſe who are leſſer then we. Of this third ſort of humility, the Apoſtle ſpeakes againe in that ſerious admonition to the Church (<hi>Phil:</hi> 2.3.) <hi>Let nothing be done through ſtrife, or vaine glory, but in lowlineſſe of minde; Let each eſteeme other better then himſelfe.</hi> As it is good to judge (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth) the worſt of our ſelves, and the beſt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo it is good to have a better opinion of others then of our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>So then, the poynt lyeth not againſt giving honour to any man, or to men of all ſorts, but only againſt the giving of undue honour to any. Of that the Apoſtle ſpeakes (<hi>Gal:</hi> 1.10.) <hi>If I yet pleaſe men, I ſhould not be the ſervant of Chriſt;</hi> that is, if I ſhould pleaſe men by flattery, ſmoothing them up in their ſins or errors, I could not be the ſervant of Chriſt. They that were the ſtrick obſervers of Chriſt, could not but obſerve this in him, that though he came to ſave man, yet he was farre enough from pleaſing, that is, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moring any man. (<hi>Luke</hi> 20.21.) <hi>And they asked him, ſaying, Maſter, we know that thou ſayeſt and teacheſt rightly, neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteſt thou the perſon of any, but teacheſt the way of God truly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet caution is to be uſed here. For ſome goe ſo farre to the other hand, that while they thinke they ought not to flatter or plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, they care not how they ſlight or diſreſpect the perſons of men; and in ſtead of ſo: bearing (as they ought) to give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due titles, they will not (as was toucht before) give ſo much as thoſe that are due; that's a ſin in defect, as the other is in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. And they ſin much more who while they refuſe to give flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering titles, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e free to give reviling titles. There are theſe two g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eat tongue-evills among men; Some give flattering titles,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:104248:75"/> others give reviling titles, detracting, calumniating, and biting titles; it is as dangerous not to forbeare the one, as to be free and forward in giving the other, and therefore we ſhould take heed of both theſe extreames, that our ſpeech may have an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall reſpect to truth, both while we praiſe, and while we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</p>

                     </note>It ſeemes to have little vertue in it, or matter of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to give flattering titles, when we are not able, or know not how to give them; To heare one that is (as we ſpeak) a meere <hi>Countryman,</hi> or a <hi>clowne</hi> ſay, I will not give flattering titles, ſpeakes not his praiſe at all, becauſe 'tis ſuppoſed he at moſt can but ſpeake ſence, or true Engliſh; but to heare a learned man, or ſome Great Courtier ſay, I will not give flattering titles, this is ſomething, this ſhewes that his honeſty maſters his ability, and that his conſcience is too ſtrong for his parts. How is it then that <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>I know not to give flattering titles?</hi> Had not <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi> wit and skill, words and language at command to give them? Was he ſo courſely bred that he could not reach them?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Thoſe words, <hi>I know not,</hi> may have a three-fold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>I know not,</hi> is, I have not made that piece of knowledge my ſtudy, I have not ſet my ſelfe to learne the art of flattery, nor to gaine the skill of carnal Courtſhip. Thus <hi>I know not</hi> to doe it, is, I have not ſet my ſelfe to doe it, I have not made it my buſineſſe, or my ayme to doe it; <hi>A good man hath,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>deſireth no skill in that which is evill, or not his duty;</hi> how much ſoever any man knows to flatter, yet we may ſay he knows not to flatter who abhorreth flattery; And can ſay (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ:</hi> 4.20.) <hi>He hath not ſo learned Christ;</hi> that is, he hath heard no ſuch leſſons, nor received any ſuch inſtruction in the ſchoole of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>I know not to give flattering titles.</hi> And doubtleſſe, 'tis beſt being an Ideot, or a bungler at the doing of that which is not good, or (as the Apoſtle ſaith, ſome are to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good work) to be reprobate to every evill work, and word. How knowing are they, who can ſay in truth, they know not how to lie, or flatter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I dare not ſay (with the Papiſts) that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:104248:75"/> is, but I am ſure this neſcience is not only the mother of devotion, but a great poynt of devotion it ſelfe. And, in this ſence every godly man, and only a godly man knoweth not how to doe evill.</p>
                  <p>For as the wicked may have the Theory of good workes, and know what it is to pray, what it is to heare the word of God, yet they have no skill, they are not ſtudied, nor fitted for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of thoſe workes; So a godly man may know in ſpeculation what it is to doe wickedly, and how to doe it as well as the moſt wicked man in the world, yet he is not at all diſpoſed nor ready for the practiſe of any wickedneſs. As nature makes us reprobate to good, ſo grace to evill workes. The Prophet ſaith of a bad ſort of men, (<hi>Jer:</hi> 4.22.) <hi>They are wiſe to doe evill, but to doe good they have no knowledge.</hi> Were they an ignorant people? No, the meaning is, they had not ſet themſelves to learne the doing of that good which they knew; theirs were not ſins of ignorance, but of wilfulneſſe, and perverſneſſe. So on the other hand, 'tis the commendation of the people of God, <hi>They are wiſe to doe good, but to doe evill they have no knowledge. I know not to give flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing titles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As to know a thing or perſon, imports the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and approbation of it. (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 1.6.) <hi>The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous;</hi> that is, he approveth it. (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 101.4.) <hi>I will not know a wicked perſon;</hi> that is, I like him not, I regard him not, I will never give him teſtimony, he ſhall neither have my hand, nor my heart. So, not to know a thing or perſon, notes our diſallowance and diſtaſt of either; in this ſence Chriſt will ſay to thoſe great knowing profeſſors (<hi>Luke</hi> 13.27.) <hi>I tell you, I know you not whence you are, depart from me,</hi> &amp;c. Thus, here when <hi>Elihu</hi> profeſſeth, <hi>I know not to give flattering titles;</hi> his meaning is, I like not, yea, I cannot abide to doe it. I may be as much skilled as any man to ſpeake high words, poſſibly I could Court it as well as others, but I have no heart to doe it, yea it is the abhorrence of my ſoule to doe it. <hi>A good man doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the doing of evill, and therefore though he know well enough how to doe evill, yet he is truely ſayd not to know how to doe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Not to know a thing,</hi> is not to be accuſtomed, or practiſed in it. Thus when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>I know not to give flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing titles;</hi> he ſeemes to ſay, <hi>It is not my manner, I have not been
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:104248:76"/> uſed to flatter.</hi> As uſe doth not only make fitneſſe, but encreaſeth our knowledge, ſo diſuſe doth at once unfit us to doe a thing, and diminiſheth our knowledge how to doe it. And therefore what we uſe not to doe, we are rightly ſayd not to know to doe. <hi>I know not to give flattering titles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>The ſpirit of a good man is ſet againſt all that is evill, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cloſe nor comply with it.</q>
                  <p>His underſtanding aſſenteth not to it, his will chuſeth it not, his conſcience cannot ſwallow it, though not a camel, but a gnat, the leaſt of ſin-evils, much leſſe doth he give himſelfe up to the free and cuſtomary practiſe of great ſins. A good man may well be ſayd, not to know to ſin, becauſe though he knoweth the nature of all ſins, yet he knowingly declines the doing of every ſin. <hi>I know not to give flattering titles,</hi>
                     <q>In ſo doing my Maker would ſoone take me away.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe words, <hi>in ſo doing,</hi> are not expreſſed in the Originall, but ſupplyed to make up the ſence; and yet we may very well read the text without them; <hi>I know not to give flattering titles, my Maker would ſoone take me away,</hi> or as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Broughton</hi> renders, <hi>my Maker would be my taker away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>My Maker.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> expreſſeth God, by the work of creation, or by his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God as a creator; <hi>Elihu</hi> doth but include himſelfe in the number of thoſe whom God hath made, he doth not exclude o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from being made by God, as much as himſelfe, while he ſaith, <hi>My Maker.</hi> God is the maker of every man, and is ſo in a three-fold conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He is the maker of every man, in his naturall conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as he is a man, conſiſting of a reaſonable ſoule and body. <hi>I am fearefully and wonderfully made,</hi> ſayd <hi>David,</hi> with reſpect to both, (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 119.14.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God is every mans maker, in his civill ſtate, as well as in his naturall; he formeth us up into ſuch and ſuch a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as rich, or as poore, as high, or as low, as Governours or as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, according to the pleaſure of his owne will. (<hi>Prov.</hi> 22.2.)
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:104248:76"/> 
                     <hi>The rich and the poore meete together, the Lord is the maker of them both;</hi> he meaneth it not only, if at all in that place, that the Lord hath made them both as men, but he hath made the one a rich man, and the other a poore man. Thus the Lord is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of them both. And as the Lord makes men rich, ſo Great and honorable. (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 75.6.) <hi>Promotion cometh not from the Eaſt, nor from the West, nor from the South;</hi> It cometh from none of theſe parts or points of earth or heaven, it cometh from nothing under heaven, but from the God of heaven; <hi>God is the Judge, he putteth downe one, and ſetteth up another.</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, The Lord is the maker of every man in his ſpirituall ſtate, as good, and holy, and gracious. (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10.) <hi>We are his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works;</hi> till we are wrought by God, we can doe none of Gods worke, nor have we any mind to doe it. Now when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>My Maker would ſoone take me away,</hi> we may underſtand it in all theſe three ſences; he that made me this body and ſoule, when I came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, he that ordered my way and ſtate all this while that I have been in this world, he that formed me up into a new life, the life of Grace, and hath made me a <hi>new man</hi> in this and for another world. This <hi>my Maker would ſoone take me away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>It is good to remember God as our maker.</q>
                  <p>Man would not make ſuch ill worke in the world, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred God his maker, or that himſelfe is the work of God. We ſhould remember God our maker; Firſt, as to our being, as from him we receive life and breath. Secondly, as to our well-being, as from him we receive all good things, both for this life and a better. (<hi>Eccleſ:</hi> 12.1.) <hi>Remember now thy creator</hi> (not only that God is a creator, but thy creator, remember this) <hi>in the dayes of thy youth;</hi> And ſurely if thou remembreſt him well, thou wilt not forget thy ſelfe ſo much as to forget the duty which thou oweſt him. Thinke often upon thy maker, and then this thought will be upon thee alwayes, <hi>If I owe my ſelfe wholly unto God for making me in nature, how much more doe I owe my ſelfe unto God, for making me a new creature.</hi> We ought to live wholly to him from whom we have received our lives. He that hath made us ſhould have the uſe of us. He hath made all things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104248:77"/> (<hi>Prov:</hi> 16.4.) chiefely man, who is the chiefe of all viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which he hath made. Thoſe two memento's, That we are made by the power of God, and that the price by which we are redeemed is the blood of God, ſhould conſtraine us at all times and in all things to be at the call and command of God. <hi>My Maker</hi>
                     <q>Would ſoone take me away.</q>

(<hi>Iſa:</hi> 40.15.) <hi>Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the ſmall duſt of the Ballance; Behold, he taketh up the Iſlands as a very little thing.</hi> Now if Whole Iſlands, if all nations are ſuch lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle things as drops and duſts, then, what is any one particular man, how big ſoever he be? And how ſoone can God take him away! Little things are taken away in a little time.

                  <p>We tranſlate, <hi>He would ſoone take me away,</hi> or he would doe it <hi>in a little time,</hi> my ruine needs not be long in working, he

                  <p>Firſt, A violent death, or a violence in death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A ſpeedy or ſudden death, a quick diſpatch. When the fire was kindled and the word ſent out againſt <hi>Korah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> their maker ſoone took them away; he bid the earth open, and it tooke them away in the twinckling of an eye; they went downe quick into hell.

                     <hi>My Maker would ſoone burne or conſume me.</hi> The word in the Hebrew ſignifieth <hi>to burne,</hi> as well as to take away, and we know the burning of a thing is the taking of it quite away; fire makes cleane riddance. And againe Fire or flame riſeth up (as a thing that is taken up) into the aire, and that which is burned in the fire may be ſayd to be taken up with it. Thus alſo 'tis tranſlated (2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 5.20, 21.) <hi>David came unto Baal-perazim, and David ſmote them there,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and there they left their Images, and David and his men burnt them;</hi> we put in the margin, <hi>and David and his men tooke them away;</hi> which is the tranſlation here in <hi>Job.</hi> Either of the readings is cleare and full to the purpoſe; God hath fire, he hath hell-fire unquenchable for ſinners, their maker can quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and burne them up. (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 27.4.) <hi>Who would ſet the briars and thorns in battell against me, I would paſſe through them and burne them up together.</hi> How quickly can the Lord burne wicked men, who like briars and thorns ſcratch and teare the innocent? wicked men can no more ſtand before the wrath of God, then briars and thorns can ſtand before a flaming fire. That's a good reading; ours comes to the ſame ſence, <hi>my Maker would ſoone take me away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> As flattery and accepting of perſons are great, ſo they are very dangerous ſins, they are wrath-provoking ſins.</q>
                  <p>If we flatter men, God will not flatter us, he will deale plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with us. To receive flattery, or to ſuffer our ſelves to be flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:104248:78"/> is very dangerous, as we ſee in the example of <hi>Herod (Acts</hi> 12.22, 23.) who having made a very eloquent Oration, <hi>The people gave a ſhout, ſaying, it is the voice of a God, and not of a man;</hi> They gave him flattering titles, or (as ſome render the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this verſe) they wonder'd at his perſon. But what was the iſſue of it? Preſently (ſaith the text) <hi>the Angel of the Lord ſmote him, becauſe he gave not God the glory, and he was eaten up with wormes, and gave up the ghoſt.</hi> Thus his Maker tooke him ſoone away, for taking that glory to himſelfe. O take heed of entertaining flatteries when given, we ſhould put them back from us, as we would a poyſonous cup. High commendations of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons given to the Preacher, may have a ſad conſequence. <hi>When men give much glory to men, 'tis hard for men to give the glory back againe to God. Herod</hi> was ſo pleaſed and tickled with the glory which the people gave him, that he could not part with it, and ſo loſt himſelfe. Becauſe he forgat that he was a worme, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by wormes. The tranſlation given us by the Septuagint of this text in <hi>Job,</hi>

                     </note> complyes fully with that dreadfull example in the <hi>Acts; I know not how to give flattering titles, for in ſo doing the wormes or moths will eate me up.</hi> The words of <hi>Elihu</hi> thus ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in <hi>Job</hi> are a threatning aſſertion, That the wormes ſhall eate thoſe that give flatteries; and the judgement which fell u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> is an example threatning all thoſe that receive flattering ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, with that dreadfull doome <hi>of being eaten up by wormes.</hi> And doubtleſſe, if not that, yet either ſome other corporal and viſible judgement, or (which is much worſe) ſome ſpirituall and inviſible judgement, will overtake thoſe who love either to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter others, or to be flattered themſelves. And as that example ſhewes how dangerous it is to receive flatteries; ſo to give flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, hath in it a double danger.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is dangerous to others. When Paraſites flatter Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when Miniſters flatter the people, how doth it enſnare their ſoules? 'Tis hell and death to flatter ſinners, and not to deale plainly with them; to give lenitives inſtead of coroſives; to give oyle where vineger ſhould be given; to heale the hurt of the ſoule deceitfully, is the greateſt hurt and wounding to the ſoule. Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries are thoſe pillows ſpoken of in the Prophet (<hi>Ezek:</hi> 13.18.) ſowed to the Arme-holes or elbowes of wicked men, upon which many ſleepe without feare, till they dye without hope; yea theſe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104248:78"/> flatteries as well as any falſities and errors of doctrine, whether reſpecting faith or worſhip, are that <hi>untempered morter,</hi> of and againſt which the Prophet ſpeakes in the ſame Chapter (<hi>v.</hi> 10.15.) wherewith ſome daubed that wall of vaine confidence which others built, while they <hi>ſeduced the people, ſaying, peace, and there was no peace.</hi> How often doe the true Prophets warne the people againſt theſe flatteries of the falſe Prophets. And how ſadly doth the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> bewaile them (<hi>Lam:</hi> 2.14.) <hi>Thy Prophets have ſeene vaine and fooliſh things for thee, and they have not diſcovered thine iniquity, to turne away thy captivity, but have ſeene for thee falſe burdens, and cauſes of baniſhment;</hi> that is, the viſions which they have ſeene, they pretend, at leaſt, to have had from God, but they are their owne dreames and brain-ſick phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and ſo the <hi>cauſe of thy baniſhment;</hi> they have undone thee with theſe deceits, ſoothing thee up in thoſe thy ſins, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured thy baniſhment, and cauſed the Lord to thruſt thee out, and ſend thee farre away from thine owne Land. They have fed, yea, filled thee with falſe hopes, till thy condition was hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. How many thouſands have been deſtroyed by flatteries both for here and for ever. And if flattery be ſo dangerous to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, then</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It muſt needs be much more dangerous to the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. It is no ſmall ſin to palliate or cover the ſins of others;<note place="margin">Non leve ſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus eſt veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem palliare. <hi>Merc:</hi>
                     </note> But it is a farre greater ſin to commend the ſins of others, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend others in their ſin. And we may take the meaſure of this ſin by the puniſhment of it. When we heare the Lord threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning flatterers with ſuddaine deſtruction, doth it not proclaime to all the world, that their ſin is full of provocation? The Lord beares long with many ſorts of ſinners, but not with ſinners of this ſort. <hi>My maker would ſoone take me away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence note, Secondly.</p>
                  <q>God can make quicke diſpatch with ſinners.</q>
                  <p>As the grace of God towards ſinners,<note place="margin">Neſcit tarda molimina ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus ſancti gratia.</note> ſo his wrath needs no long time in preparations. When we deſigne great actions, we muſt take time to fit our ſelves. Princes muſt have time to ſet out an Army or a Navy, when they would either defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt, or revenge themſelves upon their enemies; But God can preſently proceed to action, yea to execution. He that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104248:79"/> made all with a word ſpeaking, can deſtroy the wicked as ſoone as ſpeake the word; he can doe it in the twinkling of an eye, with the turning of a hand. <hi>My Maker would ſoone take me away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe <hi>Elihu,</hi> being about to ſpeake in that great cauſe, ſets God before him, and God in his judgements, in caſe he ſhould ſpeake or doe amiſſe.</p>
                  <p>Note, Thirdly.</p>
                  <q>They that doe or ſpeake evill, have reaſon to expect evill at the hand of God.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If I ſhould flatter</hi> (ſaith <hi>Elihu) my Maker would ſoone take me away.</hi> I have reaſon to feare he will; not that God takes away every ſinner as ſoone as he ſins, (God rarely uſeth Martiall Law, or executes men upon the place, we ſhould live and walke more by ſence then by faith if he ſhould doe ſo) but any ſinner may expect it, God (I ſay) is very patient and long-ſuffering, he doth not often take ſinners away, either in the act, or immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the act of ſin. Yet there is no ſinner but hath cauſe to feare, leſt as ſoone as he hath done any evill, God ſhould make him feele evill, and inſtantly take him away. <hi>David</hi> prayeth (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 28.3.) <hi>Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity.</hi> There is a two-fold <hi>drawing away</hi> with the workers of iniquity. Firſt, to doe as they doe; that is, wickedly. Thus many are drawne away with the workers of iniquity; and 'tis a good and moſt neceſſary part of prayer, to beg that God would not thus draw us away with the workers of iniquity, that is, that he would not ſuffer the workers of iniquity to draw us away into their lewd and ſinfull courſes. Secondly, there is a <hi>drawing away</hi> to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and execution. In that ſence (I conceive) <hi>David</hi> prayed, <hi>Lord draw me not away with the workers of iniquity,</hi> who are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by ſome ſudden ſtroake of judgement; though I may have provoked thee, yet let not forth thy wrath upon me, as thou ſometimes doeſt upon the workers of iniquity: doe not draw me out as cattell out of the paſture where they have been fed and fatted, for the ſlaughter. Every worker of iniquity is in danger of preſent death, and may looke that God will be a ſwift witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: though moſt are reprieved, yet no man is ſure of that.</p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:104248:79"/>
                  <p>Againe, In that <hi>Elihu</hi> repreſents God to himſelfe ready to take him away, in caſe of flattery and prevarication in that cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Note, Fourthly.</p>
                  <q>It is good for us to over-awe our ſoules with the remembrance of the judgements and terrours of God.</q>
                  <p>'Tis profitable ſometimes to converſe with the threatnings, as well as with the promiſes; 'tis profitable to remember what God is able to do againſt us, as well as to remember what God is able to do for us; Even believers ſhould goe into the dreadfull treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of wrath, into the thunders &amp; lightnings of divine diſpleaſure, as well as into the delightfull treaſuries of mercy, of love &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; it is good for a good man to thinke God may take me away, as well as to thinke God will ſave and deliver me; we need even theſe meditations of God, to keepe downe our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and to fright our luſts. Though it be the more Goſpel way to make uſe of love, yet the Goſpel it ſelfe teacheth us to make uſe of wrath, (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5.11.) <hi>Knowing the terrour of the Lord we perſwade men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Note.</p>
                  <q>When we goe about any great worke, when we are either to ſpeak or doe in any weighty matter, it is good for us to ſet God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, to thinke of and remember our Maker.</q>
                  <p>As in great undertakings we ſhould remember our Maker, waiting for and depending upon his aſſiſtance, ſtrength, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, in what we doe or goe about; ſo we ſhould remember him to keepe our hearts right. And to remember ſeriouſly, believing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpiritually, that God beholds and ſeeth us in all our wayes and workes, and that according to the frame of our hearts, and the way that we take in every action, ſuch will the reward and the iſſue be, cannot but have a mighty command, and an anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effect upon us. We can hardly doe amiſſe with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>od in our eye. And therefore as it is ſayd of a wicked man (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 10.4.) that <hi>through the pride of his countenance he will not ſeeke after God, God is not in all his thoughts.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> ſaid of himſelfe (though in that Pſalme he ſpeakes chiefely as a type of Chriſt) and ſo in proportion or as to ſincerity every godly man ſaith like <hi>David,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104248:80"/> Pſal:</hi> 16.8.) <hi>I have ſet the Lord alwayes before me: becauſe he is at my right hand, therefore I ſhall not be moved;</hi> that is, as I ſhall not be utterly overthrowne by any evill of trouble, ſo I ſhall not be overcome by any evill of temptation: or I ſhall not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved either in a way of diſcouragement by the troubles I meete with, or in a way of enticement by the temptations I meete with. How ſtedfaſt, how unmoveable are they in the worke of the Lord, how doe they keepe off from every evill worke, who ſet the Lord alwayes before them, and have him at their right hand! Could we but ſet the Lord before us, either in his mercies or in his terrors, we ſhould not be moved from doing our duty in whatſoever we are called to doe.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre <hi>Elihu</hi> hath drawne out his ſpeech, in a way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, preparing himſelfe for his great undertaking with <hi>Job;</hi> He hath now fully ſhewed the grounds why he undertooke to deale with him, and what method he would uſe in that undertaking.

               <p>Secondly, A propoſition of the matter to be debated, or of the things that <hi>Elihu</hi> had obſerved in <hi>Job's</hi> ſpeech about this Controverſie, from the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe to the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We have his confutation of what <hi>Job</hi> had affirmed, from the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe to the 31<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We have his concluſion, exciting <hi>Job</hi> to make anſwer to what he had ſpoken, elſe to heare him ſpeaking, further in the three laſt verſes of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elihu</hi> in his Preface, moves <hi>Job</hi> about two things; Firſt, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend what he was about to ſay.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To make reply to and anſwer what he ſhould ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elihu</hi> moves <hi>Job</hi> to the former duty ſeverall wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By a mild Entreaty and ſweet Inſinuation in the firſt verſe; <hi>Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, heare my ſpeeches, and hearken to my words.</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>I doe not come authoritatively and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:104248:81"/> upon thee, to command or demand thy attention, but as a faithfull friend I deſire thee to attend unto my ſpeech, and hearken to my voice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He moves him to heare, by profeſſing his own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe and preparedneſſe to ſpeak, in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe; <hi>Behold now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath ſpoken in my mouth;</hi> that is, I have been (as it were) tuning my inſtrument, and fitting my ſelfe for diſcourſe, let me not looſe my labour nor my ſtudy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He moves him to attend from the ſincerity and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ingenuity of his heart in that which he had to ſay to him. This he layeth before him in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe; <hi>My words ſhall be of the uprightneſſe of my heart, and my lips ſhall utter knowledge clearely.</hi> What better Encouragement to heare! And</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Elihu</hi> moves him to heare from the Conſideration of his preſent ſtate, as a man, not only made by God, but by him inſtructed for the work which he had undertaken, the former of which is Expreſt, the latter Implyed in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</hi> Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> Calls out <hi>Job</hi> to heare. And</p>
               <p>Secondly, As he invites him to heare what he had to ſay, ſo he provokes him to anſwer what he ſhould ſay, verſ. 5. <hi>If thou canſt anſwer me, ſet thy words in order before me, ſtand up.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Be not diſcouraged, take heart man, doe thy beſt to defend thy ſelfe, and make good thy owne cauſe againſt what I ſhall ſay; Spare me not; Doe thy beſt, thy utmoſt.</p>
               <p>Having thus encouraged him in General to anſwer, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to give him two ſpeciall Motives.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From their Common ſtate or Condition, in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>Behold, I am according to thy wiſh in Gods ſtead; I alſo am formed out of the clay.</hi> As if he had ſayd; <hi>You have often deſired to plead with God, or that God would heare your plea; now conſider, I am in Gods ſtead, though a man like your ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He encourageth him from the tenderneſſe of his ſpirit toward him, reſpecting his preſent Condition, promiſing to deal with, or treate him fairely, gently, in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>Behold, my terror ſhall not make thee afraid, neither ſhall my hand be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy upon thee.</hi> That favour <hi>Job</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:104248:81"/> in dealing with me, <hi>My terror ſhall not make thee afraid,</hi> &amp;c. Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> begins with <hi>Job,</hi> that he might lead him to receive fairely, or anſwer fully what he had to ſay.</p>
               <p>The three firſt verſes of the Chapter, Containe the firſt part of the Preface, wherein <hi>Elihu</hi> excites and calls forth <hi>Jobs</hi> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by thoſe foure Conſiderations already diſtinctly propoſed, the firſt whereof is layd downe,</p>

                  <q>'Tis good to uſe gentleneſſe towards thoſe with whom we have to deale, eſpecially with thoſe who are either outwardly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or troubled in ſpirit.</q>
                  <p>Entreaties have great power; and therefore though the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles ſpeake ſometimes in a threatning way, and command attention upon utmoſt peril, yet for the moſt part they beſpeake it with Entreaties, (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5.20.) <hi>Now then we as Embaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be ye reconciled to God.</hi> The Apoſtles went about a begging, as it were, with this meſſage, with the beſt meſſage that ever was carried forth to the world, <hi>Reconciliation unto God; we pray you.</hi> And againe (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 6.1.) <hi>We then as workers together with him, beſeech you alſo that you receive not the grace of God in vaine;</hi> that is, the doctrine of the Goſpel hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the grace and favour of God freely in Jeſus Chriſt, (1 <hi>Theſ:</hi> 4.1.) <hi>Furthermore, we beſeech you brethren, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walke and to pleaſe God, ſo ye would abound more and more.</hi> As he did beſeech them not to receive the grace of God in vaine, ſo he did beſeech them to a progreſs in &amp; an Improvement of that grace. Again (1 <hi>Theſ:</hi> 2.7.)
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:104248:82"/> 
                     <hi>We were gentle among you, even as a Nurſe cheriſheth her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi> how tender is a nurſe to the infant hanging at her breaſt, or dandled on her knee. <hi>Speak ye Comfortably to Jeruſalem,</hi> was the Lords direction when ſhe was in her warfare; that is, in a troubled and afflicted condition. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.2.) The Hebrew is, <hi>Speak to her heart;</hi> ſpeak ſuch words as may revive her heart, and adde freſh ſpirits and life to her. The Apoſtles rule for the reſtoring of thoſe that are fallen, is, that they ſhould be kindly treated (<hi>Gal:</hi> 6.1.) <hi>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye that are ſpirituall reſtore ſuch an one with the ſpirit of meekneſſe.</hi> It is a great poynt of holy skill ſo to order a reproofe as not to provoke; ſo to ſpeak as to ſpeak open, or pick the lock of the heart; Affectionate Entreaties are bleſſed pick-locks, which doe not ſtraine the wards, but effectually lift up the holders and ſhoote the bolt of the heart, cauſing it to ſtand wide open to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and take in the truth of promiſes, counſels and reproofes. <hi>Meeke words meeken the ſpirit.</hi> 'Tis hard to refuſe what we perceive ſpoken in love; and if any thing will ſoften a hard heart, ſoft language is moſt likely to doe it. When <hi>Abigail</hi> came out and met <hi>David</hi> upon his way, hot upon revenge, yea having (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter) ſworn revenge againſt <hi>Nabal</hi> and his houſe, yet her Entreaties and mild words overcame that mighty warriour, at leaſt, took off the edge of his ſpirit, and of all his party, (1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 25.33.) Nor did he only accept of or ſubmit to her counſel, but gave thanks both to God and her for it; <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord, and bleſſed be thy advice, which haſt kept me this day from ſhedding-blood.</hi> Gentle words, like gentle raine, ſoake deep, and make the ſoule, like a fruitfull tree, bud and bloſſome. For as paſſion in the ſpeaker, begets paſſion in the hearer, and heate brings forth heate, ſo kinde and kindly words, are not only moſt uſefull, but moſt powerfull. There is a rebuking, and that Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly, or a ſpeaking of cutting words, uſefull in ſome caſes, then eſpecially, when ſinners have not only done evill, but are ſetled and reſolved in it. But in caſe of affliction, ſpecially of inward affliction, or trouble of ſpirit, ſoft words are beſt and doe beſt. <hi>Heare, I pray thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Elihu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And hearken to all my words.</q>
                  <p>Here's hearing, and hearkening, to hearken is more then to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104248:82"/> heare; to heare is barely to receive the ſound of words; but to hearken is to take up the ſenſe of them, or as it were to ſuck out the ſtrength and ſweetneſſe of them; to hearken is to weigh or ponder every tittle ſpoken, and take the value of it. The word in the text, which ſignifies <hi>to hearken,</hi> hath a ſingular elegancy in it. One of the Rabbins renders, <hi>Eare my words;</hi> heare my words and Eare them. The ſame word which in the verbe ſignifies to hearken, which is the worke of the eare, ſignifies alſo the eare, or inſtrument of that worke in the noune. To <hi>eare words,</hi> notes the moſt diligent attention, as to <hi>eye a thing,</hi> notes the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate inſpection. The word ſignifies alſo the beam of a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, becauſe by the eare, or by the two ears (as by a ballance) words are tryed and poyſed, whether they are weighty and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, or light and chaffy; when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, hearken to, or weigh my words, he intimates that he meant to ſpeak words which had worth in them, or that he meant to ſpeak matter more then words. And therefore he would not have a word loſt, <hi>Hearken,</hi> ſaith he,
<q>To all my words.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To all,</hi> not to this or that only, but to all; As if he had ſayd, <hi>I intend not, and I hope I ſhall not ſpeak one needleſſe or unuſefull words;</hi> not a word beſide the buſineſſe. Therefore <hi>hearken to all my words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note; Firſt.</p>
                  <q>They who ſpeak to inſtruction, admonition or exhortation, ſhould not uſe one word more then is uſefull, not a word more then is to the purpoſe.</q>
                  <p>Seeing, <hi>every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it in the day of Judgement,</hi> (Math: 12.36.) How ſhould every man take heed of ſpeaking an idle word, a word of which he can give no good account for any good it is likely to doe. Idle words will make ſad worke one day, and words of no value or account, will turne to a heavy account in the great day. <hi>That's an idle word, which doth neither worke the heart for good, nor ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the hand to or in a good worke.</hi> And if we ſhould be carefull not to ſpeake one idle word, or not one word unworthy to be heard, how ſhould we avoyd evill words, or words which corrupt the hearers.</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:104248:83"/>
                  <p>Secondly, As the words referre to that duty which <hi>Elihu</hi> minds <hi>Job</hi> of, and moved him to, <hi>Hearkning to all his words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>They who heare, eſpecially about holy things and ſoule-matters, ſhould heare all.</q>
                  <p>One word ſhould not be loſt, when every word is precious. We gather up the filings and leaſt duſts of Gold. The eare ſhould gather all that truth which the mouth ſcatters, and the heart ſhould lay it up as treaſure. We may charge many ſorts of men with deficiency at eare-worke. And ſurely if men will not heare all that they ought to believe and doe, they can neither doe nor believe any thing that they heare.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some will not heare the word at all, they are like the deafe Adder ſtopping their eares at the voyce of the charmer, charme he never ſo wiſely to them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others thinke that there's not a word more to be heard, but what they have heard already, who can ſpeak what they know not?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There are few who hearken to any word that is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; that is, who make it their buſineſſe to heare, who heare with diligence, and labour at it. As it is a great labour to ſpeak, ſo I aſſure you, it is no ſmall nor eaſie labour to heare, if you heare indeed and as you ſhould. To heare the word is the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the whole ſoule. Among many hearers, there are but few hearkeners, ſuch I meane as weigh and conſider what they heare.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, There are very few who heare and hearken to all the words of righteouſneſſe and ſalvation. As ſome though they heare all, yet hearken to halves, ſo others will heare but halfe, or only ſo much as pleaſeth them of what is ſpoken. When the King of <hi>Judah</hi> (Jer: 36.23.) had the Role brought to him which <hi>Baruch</hi> had written from the mouth of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> he heard three or foure leaves of it read to him as he ſate by the fire, and then he cauſed it to be cut with a penknife and caſt into the fire; He did not read it out, he had enough of it, he had (as we ſay) <hi>his belly full,</hi> but his heart was altogether empty, he was very angry and vext at the word, but not at all humbled nor affected with it; and therefore would not heare all thoſe words.</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:104248:83"/>
                  <p>Againe, To hearken is to obey, to ſubmit and yield up our ſelves to the truth we heare. <hi>Samuel</hi> tells <hi>Saul</hi> (1 Sam: 15.22.) <hi>To obey is better then ſacrifice, and to hearken then the fat of Rams;</hi> to obey and to hearken is the ſame thing; the obedient eare is the hearkening eare. <hi>Mine eare haſt thou opened</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 40.6.) This opening or digging of his eare (as we put in the Margin) ſignified his readineſſe to obey, as 'tis expreſſed (<hi>v.</hi> 7, 8.) <hi>Then ſayd I loe I come; I delight to doe thy will O my God.</hi> And in reference to this he had ſayd before (<hi>v:</hi> 6.) <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and offering thou didſt not deſire, burnt-offering and ſin-offering haſt thou not required;</hi> that is, for themſelves, or comparatively to that, which in the volume of thy booke is written of me, that I ſhould doe. Which clearely expounds and is almoſt the ſame in termes with that of <hi>Samuel; To obey is better then ſacrifice, and to hearken, then the fat of Rams.</hi> Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> preſſeth <hi>Job</hi> to hearken to <hi>all his words</hi> obedientially, or to hearken with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to obey. Take a few Conſiderations, why we ſhould both heare and hearken to, that is, obey, the whole mind of God, all thoſe words which have the ſtamp of divine authority upon them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, All the words of God are alike holy and true, pure and precious. Though ſome truths are more neceſſary to be knowne and believed then others, yet all are neceſſary; nor can we be diſcharged from the duty of hearing and obeying any one of them, if called.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a like or the ſame power and authority in all the words of God; ſo that to neglect or ſlight any one word, is to put a ſlight upon the authority of God himſelfe. There is but one Law-giver and word-ſender.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Not to ſubmit to any one word (though it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed we hearken to all others) drawes upon us the guilt of non-ſubmiſſion or diſobedience to the whole word of God. That's the Apoſtles concluſion (<hi>James</hi> 2.12. <hi>ver.) Whoſoever ſhall keepe the whole Law, and yet offend in one poynt, he is guilty of all;</hi> for though in many things we offend all, yet there is a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-ſence wherein we are ſaid to keep the whole Law of God. And ſo the Apoſtles meaning is, that whoſoever ſhall give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a looſe or a liberty, whoſoever ſhall diſpence or indulge himſelfe in breaking any one Command of God, he breakes all,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:104248:84"/> that is, he declares himſelfe ready to break all, if he had a like occaſion or temptation.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We would have all our words hearkened to by God, we would have God grant all our Petitions, all our requeſts, and ſupplications, and ſhall not we hearken to and obey all the precepts of God? Shall we not receive and believe all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and threatnings?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, As we deſire God would, ſo God hath promiſed to heare all our words, even all the requeſts of his people which are according to his will. Chriſt ſpeakes without reſtriction (<hi>Math:</hi> 21.22.) <hi>All things whatſoever ye aske in my name, believing ye ſhall receive.</hi> And againe (<hi>John</hi> 14.13, 14.) <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall aske in my name, that will I doe,</hi> &amp;c. Nor are there any reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the promiſes of God in granting and doing what we aske, but only theſe two; Firſt, that we aske <hi>right things;</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that we aske <hi>aright.</hi> Now if the Lord hath promiſed to hearken to all our words, not to this or that, but to all our words which are according to his will, (we have no liberty to aske be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the will of God, beyond the rule of Scripture, nor can we aske any thing beyond that, but it is to our hurt and damage, now if God (I ſay) will hearken to all our words) ſhould not we hearken to all his?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The condition upon which God hath promiſed to heare all our words, is, that we ſhould be ready ro heare and hearken to all his words, (1 <hi>John</hi> 3.22.) <hi>Whatſoever we aske we receive, becauſe we keepe his Commandements, and doe the things that pleaſe him.</hi> It were not confidence, but higheſt and moſt hatefull impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to expect that God ſhould pleaſe us by giving us what we aske, while we refuſe (which is the condition of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe) to doe the things that pleaſe him. Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> would have <hi>Job</hi> hearken to all his words, he being about to ſpeake, not his owne, but the words of God. And that <hi>Job</hi> might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ot delay the opening of his eare to heare, <hi>Elihu</hi> tells him further in the next verſe, that himſelfe had already opened his mouth to ſpeake.</p>

                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:104248:84"/>
                  <p>Firſt, That a man hath been long ſilent; they that are full of talke, and ſpeake out of ſeaſon, may be ſaid to have their mouth alwayes open, rather then at any time to open their mouthes. But <hi>Elihu</hi> profeſſed in the former Chapter that he had waited as a Diſciple to heare and to learne, and had waited with utmoſt patience; therefore he might well ſay, <hi>Behold now I have opened my mouth,</hi> and taken upon me to ſpeake. So (<hi>Chap:</hi> 3.1.) after <hi>Job</hi> had ſate ſilent a great while, it is ſaid, <hi>Then Job opened his mouth, and curſed the day of his birth;</hi> Thus to open the mouth, intimates much ſilence or forbearance of ſpeech, and long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a ſeaſon or opportunity to ſpeake.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Opening the mouth, implyeth as ſpeaking after much ſilence, ſo with much prudence. A fooles mouth is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſayd to be alwayes open, becauſe whenſoever he ſpeaketh, he is found ſpeaking imprudently and impertinently.<note place="margin">Os aperire di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur apud Hebraeos, qui inſtituunt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monem ſerium et de re gravi. <hi>Piſc:</hi>
                     </note> But a wiſe man will not ſpeake, unleſſe he may ſpeake to purpoſe, and ſo opens his mouth to ſpeake. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 24.7.) <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is too high for a foole, he openeth not his mouth in the gate;</hi> that is, he is unfit to ſpeak in the preſence of wiſe and judicious men, he may open his mouth in the ſtreets, and in common Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but he opens not his mouth in the gate, where the Elders and Magiſtrates uſed to meete and judge the weightieſt matters. There is a foure-fold Conſideration to be had, as to the due open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the mouth, (And 'tis no ſmall matter to open the mouth with thoſe Conſiderations.)</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Conſideration is to be had of the place and Company where, and to whom we ſpeake. We muſt not caſt pearles before ſwine, nor give ſtrong meate to children.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The time and ſeaſon wherein we ſpeake muſt be conſidered; every truth is not fit for every time. Chriſt would not ſpeak all at once to his Diſciples, for this reaſon, (<hi>John</hi> 16.12.) <hi>I have many things to ſay unto you, but ye cannot beare them now;</hi> and becauſe ye cannot beare them now, therefore I will not ſay them now.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſideration is to be had how and in what way to ſpeake, whether inſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uctingly, or exhortingly, reprovingly, or Comfortably, we ſhould alwayes labour to divide the word of God, and what we ſpeake from it aright, giving every one his proper part and portion. Then a man opens his mouth to ſpeake,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:104248:85"/> when he Conſiders how to ſort his ſpeech according to the ſtate of things and perſons before him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſideration is to be had of the end or tendency of ſpeech, what our ayme and mark is; we ſay, <hi>a fooles bolt is ſoone ſhot,</hi> he Conſiders not his ayme and mark in ſpeaking; he that opens his mouth, looks to his mark, and drives a deſigne, or hath a purpoſe in every word that paſſeth from him.</p>

When a man (I ſay) doth not ſpeak any of theſe covert wayes, but freely and liberally, then indeed he opens his mouth to ſpeake. We have that Expreſſion in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.21.) <hi>In that day will I cauſe the horn of the houſe of Iſrael to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them, and they ſhall know that I am the Lord;</hi> That is, I will give thee boldneſſe, and liberty of ſpeech: time was when thou didſt not dare to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>peake a word for God, or of God, of his praiſe, name and worſhip, or if thou didſt it was but in a Corner, or whiſperd in ſecret; but the time ſhall come when I will give thee the opening of the mouth; thou ſhalt ſpeak my truth and praiſes boldly: and the Enemy ſhall know that I the Lord have procured thee this liberty. 'Tis a great mercy when God gives his people the opening of the mouth, or liberty of ſpeech, to ſpeak boldly, no man hindring, no nor ſo much as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them. The Prophet makes that the character of <hi>an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill time, when the prudent keep ſilence,</hi> (Amos 5.13.) As in evill or calamitous times, it becomes the Godly prudent to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſilent, adoring the juſtice of Gods ſevereſt diſpenſations towards them with patience and without murmuring at his hand. So in ſome evill times they are forced to keepe ſilence, (though as <hi>David</hi> ſpake, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 39.2.) their ſorrows be ſtirred) either leſt by ſpeaking, even nothing but truth and reaſon, they draw fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſorrows upon themſelves; or becauſe they ſee it but loſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſpeake to a people obſtinate and reſolved on their way.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This phraſe of opening the mouth to ſpeake, notes the things ſpoken to be of very great worth, ſuch as have been long concocted and digeſted, and at laſt ready to be brought
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:104248:85"/> forth, as out of the treaſury of an honeſt and underſtanding heart.<note place="margin">Os aperire eſt bene diſcuſſa et praemeditata habere dicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da. <hi>Bold:</hi>
                     </note> The heart is the treaſury of words, there they are ſtored up: and from thence iſſued forth; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> As there is a ſtock of evill words in the hearts of evill men, ſo of good and gracious words in the hearts of Godly men, and when they open their mouthes (according to this notion) it is to bring forth the treaſures, and riches of their hearts, to bring forth the gold and ſilver and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things ſtored up there; all theſe are very uſefull interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this phraſe; and I might give diſtinct obſervations from them, but it may ſuffice to have named them. I ſhall only adde that the laſt is conceived by ſome to be chiefely intended in the latter branch of this verſe.</p>
                  <q>My tongue hath ſpoken in my mouth.</q>
                  <p>This ſeems a ſtrange Expreſſion; where ſhould the tongue ſpeak but in the mouth? when the tongue is out of the mouth, can it ſpeak? as the mouth cannot ſpeak without the tongue, ſo the tongue cannot ſpeak out of the mouth: why then doth he ſay;

We ſay ſuch a thing is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſavory to the palate; And we call that <hi>Palate wine,</hi> which is quicke and lively, briske and pleaſant to the taſt. Thus when <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihu</hi> ſaith here, <hi>My tongue hath ſpoken in my mouth or palate;</hi> His meaning is; I have uttered only that which I have wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, what my tongue hath ſpoken to you, I have taſted my ſelfe; I have put every word to my palate; For as a man that that taſteth wine or any other ſapid thing, muſt have it upon his palate, before he can make a Judgement, whether it be ſweet or ſharpe, quick or flat: ſo faith <hi>Elihu,</hi> my mouth hath ſpoken in my palate, I taſted my words before I ſpake them.</p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:104248:86"/>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>Judicious and wiſe men will tast and try what they intend to ſpeake before they utter it.</q>
                  <p>The ſpeaker preſents his words to the taſt of the hearer; For as this Scripture hath it at the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe of the next Chapter, <hi>The eare tryeth words, as the mouth taſteth meat;</hi> now he that ventures his words to the taſt and cenſure of others, had need take a taſt of them before he doth it. <hi>My tongue hath ſpoken in my mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the ſcope of <hi>Elihu</hi> in adding this, namely, to gaine attention,</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>There is great reaſon we ſhould heare that carefully, which the ſpeaker hath prepared with care.</q>
                  <p>They who regard not what they ſpeake, deſerve no regard when they ſpeake; but a weighing ſpeaker, ſhould have a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hearer. And what any mans tongue (in the ſence of <hi>Elihu</hi>) hath <hi>ſpoken in his mouth,</hi> that we ſhould heare, not only with our eare, but with our heart. This a ſtrong argument to quicken attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet <hi>Elihu</hi> gives in another, and a ſtronger in the next verſe.</p>

                  <p>In the former verſe <hi>Elihu</hi> called for an open eare, becauſe he opened his mouth, and was about to ſpeak, or had ſpoken what he had well taſted.

                  </q>
                  <p>The meaning is not, that the uprightneſſe of his heart ſhould be the ſubject upon which he would treat, though that be a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and moſt uſefull ſubject, yet it was not the poynt he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſcuſſe: but when he ſaith, <hi>My words ſhall be of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe of my heart,</hi> his meaning is, my words ſhall flow from

                     </note> 
                     <hi>I will ſpeak truth plainly, I'le ſpeak as I thinke, you may ſee the Image of my heart upon every word, I will ſpeak without dawbing, without either ſimulation or diſſimulation.</hi> Some conceive this to be a ſecret reproofe of, or reflection upon <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, as if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſuſpected them to have ſpoken worſe of <hi>Job,</hi> then they could thinke him to be in their hearts. But as we cannot judge mens hearts directly, ſo there is no reaſon why we ſhould judge ſo of their hearts conjecturally. It is enough to the purpoſe, that <hi>Elihu</hi> aſſerts his owne uprightneſſe without reflecting upon or ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the uprightneſſe of thoſe, who had dealt with <hi>Job</hi> before; <hi>My words ſhall be in the uprightneſſe of my heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This uprightneſſe of his heart may have a three-fold Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Firſt, to paſſion; Some ſpeake in the heat and fire of their hearts, rather then in the uprightneſſe of them; it is good to ſpeak with the heat and fire of zeal in our hearts; but take heed of the heat and fire of paſſion, I will not ſpeak in the heat, but in the uprightneſſe of my heart, ſaith <hi>Elihu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, This uprightneſſe may be oppos'd to partiality, I will not ſpare when there is cauſe to ſpeake home, nor preſſe, nor load thee with any thing where there is not cauſe for it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This uprightneſſe in ſpeaking,<note place="margin">Non loquar ad calumniendum vel ad rid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> may alſo be oppos'd to ſpeaking without cleare ground or proofe. And 'tis ſuppoſed that <hi>Elihu</hi> aymed more ſpecially at this, <hi>Jobs</hi> friends having been ſo high in his reproofe, charging him with divers things for which they had no proofe, but only a vehement ſuſpition. The words of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> are full (<hi>Chap:</hi> 22. 5.) <hi>Is not thy wickedneſſe great, and thine iniquities infinite? for thou haſt taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and ſtripped the naked of their Clothing: Thou hast ſent widdowes empty away, and the armes of the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe have been broken:</hi> Surely <hi>Eliphaz</hi> could not ſpeak this in the uprightneſſe of his heart, knowing it to be ſo, though he ſpake it in this uprightneſſe of his heart, that he really thought it to be ſo. Which kind of uprightneſſe <hi>Paul</hi> had in perſecuting the Saints, (<hi>Acts</hi> 26.9.) <hi>I verily thought with my ſelfe, that I ought to doe many things contrary to the Name of Jeſus of Nazareth.</hi> Thus <hi>Jobs</hi> friends verily thought he had done many Groſſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:104248:87"/> to the Law of God, but they only thought ſo, they could not prove it; This is a lame kinde of uprightneſſe, and in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this <hi>Elihu</hi> might now ſay, I will not charge or burden thee with any thing but what I know to be true, and had even from thy own mouth. <hi>My words ſhall be of the uprightneſſe of my heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall not ſtay to give particular notes from theſe words, according to this three-fold oppoſition; The reader may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them in that, as he hath occaſion; Only in Generall Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>The heart and tongue ſhould goe together.</q>
                  <p>The tongue ſhould alwayes be the hearts Interpreter, and the heart ſhould alwayes be the tongues ſuggeſter; what is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the tongue ſhould be firſt ſtampt upon the heart, and wrought off from it. Thus it ſhould be in all our Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and exhortations, eſpecially when we ſpeak or exhort about the things of God, and diſpence the myſteries of heaven. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpake from his heart while he ſpake from his faith (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 116.10.) <hi>I believed, therefore have I ſpoken.</hi> Believing is an act of the heart, with the heart man believeth; ſo that to ſay, <hi>I belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, therefore have I ſpoken;</hi> Is as if he had ſaid, <hi>I would never have ſpoken theſe things, if my heart had not been cleare and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in them.</hi> The Apoſtle takes up that very proteſtation from <hi>David</hi> (2 Cor: 4.13.) <hi>According as it is written, I believed, therefore have I ſpoken; we alſo believe, and therefore ſpeak;</hi> that is, we moved others to believe nothing but what we believed, yea, were fully aſſured of, our ſelves, as the next words of the Apoſtle import, <hi>Knowing, that he which raiſed up the Lord Jeſus, ſhall raiſe up us alſo by Jeſus, and ſhall preſent us with you.</hi> To ſpeak what we in our hearts believe, is to ſpeak in the upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our hearts.</p>
                  <p>Some ſpeak without their hearts, that is, coldly, they have no heart at all in ſpeaking; as ſome heare without their hearts, only with their eares; ſo ſome ſpeak without the heart, only with the tongue.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others ſpeake what was never in their hearts; They have no experience in themſelves of what they ſay to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. They throw out their words at a venture. It is ſad to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:104248:87"/> ſpeak that as a truth, or a Comfort to others, which we have not found in our ſelves, that is, have not felt the operation of it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our owne hearts. How are they to be lamented, who ſpeak of the things of God as a Stage-player, who acts the part of, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonates a Prince, being himſelfe but a poore plebeian. It is bad to ſpeak without our hearts, or coldly, but 'tis worſe to ſpeak what was never in our hearts, or hypocritically.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Not a few ſpeak quite againſt their hearts; theſe are at fartheſt diſtance from ſpeaking in the uprightneſſe of their heart; they ſpeak with a falſe and malicious heart, they ſpeak with a deceitful and double heart, with a heart and a heart. There are three wayes wherein men ſpeak againſt their owne hearts and Conſciences.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In the profeſſion which they make of themſelves, (<hi>Rev:</hi> 2.9.) Chriſt writing to the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> ſaith, <hi>I know thy faith and patience,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>Blaſphemy of them who ſay they are Jewes and are not, but lye,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo at the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Chapter, <hi>Which ſay they are Jewes and are not, but doe lye.</hi> We are not to underſtand it ſtrictly, that they profeſſed themſelves to be of the Nation of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham.</hi> A <hi>Jew</hi> there is, any one that holdeth out a profeſſion of the faith of Chriſt. Old Teſtament words are often applyed to the New Teſtament, or Goſpel ſtate; they ſay they are <hi>Jewes,</hi> that is, true believers, but they are not, and doe lye; to lye, is to goe againſt a mans mind, againſt his Conſcience; they make a great profeſſion of godlineſſe and holineſſe, of Chriſt and his wayes, and they lye at every word; for indeed they are <hi>the Synagogue of Satan.</hi> Thus at this day ſome make profeſſion before the Church of God, and by ſuch profeſſion get admittance into the Church of God, who yet belong to the Synagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeakes of ſuch, (1 <hi>Ep: Joh:</hi> 2.19.) <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us;</hi> that is, they were not truly of us, though they once deſired to come in and joyne themſelves to us, and for a time walked with us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The tongue ſpeaks againſt the heart many times in the promiſes which men make to others of what they will doe. O what Courteſies and friendſhips will ſome men profeſſe! they will tell you aloud how they love you, and how much they are your ſervants, while there is nothing in their hearts, but deceit
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:104248:88"/> and guile, yea poſſibly nothing but wrath and revenge to death. Thus <hi>Iſhmael</hi> went out <hi>weeping all along as he went (Jer:</hi> 41.6.) and ſayd, <hi>Come to Gedaliah, the ſon of Ahikam,</hi> yet he invited them into the City as poore birds into a ſnare, to deſtroy them preſently; He was ſeemingly troubled at their affliction and wept, but his were Crocodiles tears, he murthered them as ſoone as he had them in his power.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Some ſpeake againſt their hearts doctrinally or in the Doctrines which they propound and teach. There are three ſorts who ſpeak amiſſe doctrinally.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some ſpeak that which is not right in the uprightneſſe of their hearts; or, I may ſay, they ſpeak that which is falſe with a true heart; that is, they think it to be a truth which they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when 'tis an error, and will be found ſo at laſt. When ever we ſee different opinions ſtifly maintained among honeſt and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, (which though it be a very ſad ſight, yet it is too often ſeene, in that caſe I ſay) one ſide alwayes ſpeaks that which is falſe with a true heart, and utters error uprightly. The truth is, ſome men defend an error with better and more honeſt hearts, then ſome others defend the truth. For</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are ſuch as ſpeak right without any up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe of heart, or they ſpeak truth with a falſe heart; this <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpecially profeſſeth againſt; he would not only ſpeak that which was right, but with uprightneſſe. The Apoſtle found ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral teachers of this ſecond ſort (<hi>Phil:</hi> 1.16, 17, 18.) Some preach Chriſt, that is, the Goſpel, yea the truth of Chriſt in the Goſpel, (elſe the Apoſtle would not have rejoyced in it, as he profeſſeth he did at the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>I therein doe rejoyce, yea and will rejoyce.</hi>) Yet theſe men did not preach in the uprightneſſe of their own hearts; for, ſaith he, <hi>Some Preach Christ out of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and ſtrife, and ſome out of good will,</hi> (they preached Chriſt, pure Goſpel, yet not with pure hearts, for, he adds, they did it) <hi>ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to adde affliction to my bonds;</hi> They preacht to oppoſe the Apoſtles more then to ſet up Chriſt, and though they preached the truth, yet they did it more <hi>in pretence then in truth;</hi> as 'tis ſayd at the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe. The ſame Apoſtle ſpeakes of others, (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 11.13, 14.) who preached what was true for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and yet he calls them <hi>falſe Apoſtles, deceitfull workers, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt, and no marvell, for
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:104248:88"/> Satan himſelfe is transformed into an Angel of light.</hi> They formed and ſhaped themſelves into Angels of light, and tooke up the doctrine of the faithfull Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt in ſome things, yet they did it not in the uprightneſſe of their hearts, but that they might weaken the eſtimation of the true Apoſtles in the hearts of the people, and ſet up themſelves there, that ſo in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things they might with greater efficacy or more effectually, miſ-lead them or draw them into error. Thus ſome are found ſpeaking lyes in the truth of their hearts, and others ſpeaking truth in the falſeneſſe of their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Many ſpeak that which is falſe with a falſe heart; This is the height of wickedneſſe. The Apoſtle propheſieth of ſuch (1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 4.2.) <hi>Who ſhall ſpeake lyes in hypocriſie:</hi> the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they ſpeak is a lye, and they ſpeak it with a baſe and falſe heart too. And therefore he ſaith of theſe in the ſame verſe, <hi>Their conſciences are ſeared with a hot iron;</hi> that is, they are inſencible both of the miſchiefe they doe, and of the miſery they muſt ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> profeſſeth himſelfe to be none of all theſe; He ſpake that which was right and true in the uprightneſſe and truth of his heart. Such a one the Apoſtle directs the Goſpel Deacon to be, (1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3.9.) <hi>Holding the myſtery of faith in a pure Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which is the ſame with an upright heart. And he tells us (1 <hi>Theſ:</hi> 2.4, 5.) That himſelfe did not uſe any guile in the miniſtration of the Goſpel. He had truth on his ſide, and he had truth in his heart, as he alſo profeſſed to his Brethren the <hi>Jewes, (Rom:</hi> 9.1, 2.) <hi>I ſpeak the truth in Chriſt, I lye not, my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence alſo bearing me witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. And againe, (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2.17.) <hi>We are not of thoſe that Corrupt the truth; we ſpeak the truth, and ſpeak it truly.</hi> He is a better ſpeaker that ſpeaks with an upright heart, then he that ſpeakes with an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent tongue; He is the happy ſpeaker, who ſpeakes more with his heart then with his tongue, that can ſay with <hi>Elihu</hi> to <hi>Job, My words ſhall be of the uprightneſſe of my heart.</hi> Words ſpoken of that ſubject, and words flowing from that ſubject, are lovely words. Of this latter ſort ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi> to <hi>Job, My words ſhall be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And my lips ſhall utter knowledge clearly.</q>

(<hi>Jer:</hi> 5.11.) <hi>He made bright his arrowes,</hi> there this word is uſed. It is applyed alſo to Chiefe men (1 <hi>Chron:</hi> 7.48.) <hi>Theſe were Choyce men,</hi> pure men. So ſaith <hi>Elihu (My lips ſhall utter cleare ſhining pure knowledge.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>We ſhould ſpeak cleare truth. Truth without mixture, truth well winnowed, doctrine well refined.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The commandement of the Lord</hi> is a pure word, (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 19.8.) There's not any droſs at all in it, 'tis like ſilver tryed ſeven times in the fire (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 12.6.) The Prophet among other bleſſings which God promiſeth to his Church and people, hath this (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 30.24.) <hi>The Oxen likewiſe and the young Aſſes that eare the ground ſhall eate cleane Provender, free from the ſtraw, and chaff, duſt and darnel.</hi> But may we not here renew the Apoſtles queſtion, (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 9.9, 10.) <hi>Doth God take care for oxen?</hi> or ſaith he it altogether for our ſakes? for our ſakes no doubt it is written; That <hi>the mouth of the oxe treading out the corne, ſhould not be muzzl'd,</hi> was written for the Miniſters ſake, to aſſure them, that while they labour in the Goſpel to feed ſouls, their bodies ſhould be fed. And that the <hi>oxen and young aſſes ſhall eate cleane pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender,</hi> was written for the peoples ſake, to aſſure them, that Chriſt would ſend them ſuch Miniſters as ſhould feed them with pure holy wholeſome doctrine, not with the chaffe of unwritten traditions, nor with the mixtures of humane i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>entions. They ſhould be taught cleare knowledge, as <hi>Elihu</hi> here ſpeaketh. This mercy was alſo prophecied (<hi>Zeph:</hi> 3.9.) <hi>Then will I turne to the people a pure language,</hi> or a <hi>Clean lip:</hi> it is this word, that is,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:104248:89"/> what they ſpeak, ſhall be pure truth. Their language ſhall be, not only Grammatically pure, proper and genuine, but Theological<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pure, without any tincture of error in it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the word is taken (according to our tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) Adverbially.</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>We ought to ſpeake truth clearly.</q>
                  <p>Some ſpeake cleare truths, who yet doe not ſpeak them clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. They ſpeak great truths, yet obſcure them in their own way of expreſſions; they who wrap up ſound doctrine in hard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth words, or deliver it in an unneceſſary multitude of words, doe rather puzzle and confound their Auditors, then enforme or inſtruct them. And they who ſpeak not knowledge clearly, are like thoſe who mud the waters, or raiſe a duſt in the ayre, which will not let others ſee diſtinctly what they hold or put in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Speaking in darke words and ſtrange notions, is like ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſtrange language. They only ſpeak profitably, who ſpeak clearly. We commonly ſay, <hi>Truth ſeekes no corners,</hi> truth would not be hid. What are obſcure and ambiguous words, words of a doubtfull conſtruction and interpretation, but <hi>corners,</hi> wherein many hide truth, while they pretend to ſpeak and publiſh it. Such ſpeakers as wel as they who ſpeak in an unknowne language, are Barbarians to their hearers. And therefore as the Apoſtle in reference to an unknowne tongue, ſo ſhould we ſay in reference to any covert or obſcure way of ſpeaking in our owne mother tongue, <hi>We had rather ſpeak five words that others may be edified, then ten thouſand words in hard and ſtrange expreſſions.</hi> Though we ſpeak in a knowne language, yet doubtfull words hinder edifying as much as an unknowne language doth; yea ſuch are as a forrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to their hearers, while they ſpeak in their owne Country tongue: 'Tis a ſpeciall gift of God, to ſpeak knowledge clearly. The Apoſtle hath left that excellent advice with all who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſpeak the great things of eternall life, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11.) <hi>If any man ſpeak</hi> (that is, if he ſpeak about the things of God, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things) <hi>let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God.</hi> What are they? The oracles of God are the knowne word of God. But how are thoſe oracles to be knowne? Surely as God ſpake them, plainly and clearly; The oracles of God were ſpoken without ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:104248:90"/> therefore let no man ſpeake them as the oracles of the devil were ſpoken, or as the devill ſpake his oracles, that is, ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and doubtfully; The devill of old gave out all his anſwers and oracles doubtfully and darkly to his darke and blinded vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries; what he ſayd might beare ſeverall Conſtructions. And he ſpake ſo on purpoſe, that whatſoever the event or iſſue proved to be, he (though the father of lyes) might have the reputation of ſpeaking truth.<note place="margin">Croeſus Halym penetrans mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam perver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And when <hi>Saul</hi> came to Enquire of the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> that is, of the Devill, (1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 28.11.) he gave him a doubtfull reſolve; <hi>To morrow ſhalt thou and thy Sons be with me</hi> (v. 19.) Which ambiguous an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer might be underſtood as of the next day following, ſo indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely of any day neere approaching. Satan loves not to ſpeake knowledge clearely. But the ſervants and meſſengers of Chriſt, muſt uſe great plainneſs of ſpeech while they are treating of and giving out the mind of God to his people; and be carefull that as the doctrine is ſound which they deliver, ſo there may be a clearneſs in their delivering of it. Their lips (as <hi>Elihu</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged his ſhould) ought to <hi>utter knowledge clarely.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>There are two things here to be enquired; Firſt, what we are to underſtand by the Spirit of God, to whom <hi>Elihu</hi> attributes his making. Secondly, Why doth <hi>Elihu</hi> attribute his making to the Spirit of God? To the former queſtion, I anſwer; Firſt, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively, that by the Spirit of God we are not to underſtand a power or vertue put forth by God, in which ſence we ſometimes read the Spirit of God in Scripture. But by the Spirit of God here, we are to underſtand God the Spirit. In which ſence we read (<hi>Gen:</hi> 1.2.) <hi>The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</hi> As alſo (<hi>Math:</hi> 3.16.) <hi>He ſaw the Spirit of God deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending like a dove, and lighting upon him;</hi> that is, upon Jeſus Chriſt, baptized by <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Jordan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond queſtion is, Why doth <hi>Elihu</hi> attribute his making to the Spirit of God? Regeneration or our new-making is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the work of the Spirit, but is Creation, or our naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution his work alſo? Saith not <hi>Moſes?</hi> (Gen: 2.7.) <hi>The Lord God formed man out of the dust of the earth; Jehovah Elohim</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med man. And if we look into the firſt of <hi>John</hi> ver: 2, 3. we read thus; <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God; the ſame was in the beginning with God, all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made, that was made.</hi> There our maker (for the making of all things is attributed to him) is the Son, the ſecond perſon in the holy Trinity, or the <hi>Word,</hi> who (as it followeth in that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) <hi>was made fleſh.</hi> Why then doth <hi>Elihu</hi> here aſcribe his making to the Spirit? And how are theſe Scriptures recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, By that received <hi>Maxime</hi> in Divinity, <hi>The workes of the holy Trinity towards the creature are undevided.</hi> So that, while this Scripture aſcribes the making of man to the Spirit or Third perſon in the Trinity, it doth not at all croſſe thoſe which aſcribe it to the firſt or ſecond, the Father or the Son. <hi>The Spirit of God hath made me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Man as to his bodily making, or the making of his body, is the workmanſhip of God.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As we are his workmanſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus to good</hi> (or

We have heard of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine conſultation or reſolution rather (<hi>Gen:</hi> 1.26.) <hi>Let us make man:</hi> The Father made man, and the Son made man, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit made man; The Father by the Son, through the holy Spirit made man.

And this is true, not only of the firſt man in his creation, but of every man ſince the creation, there is a concurrence of a divine power and workmanſhip in the ſetting up of man as man. (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 100.3.) <hi>It is he that made us, and not we our ſelves;</hi> God doth not only make us holy men, but he makes us men. Hence <hi>David</hi> (Pſal: 13.9-14.) <hi>I am fearefully, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made.</hi> He ſpeaks there of the frame of his body, though that be much more true in reference to the admirable frame of the new creature which is ſet up in the ſoule; ſo, indeed we are fearefully and wonderfully made. (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 27.11.) <hi>This is a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of no underſtanding</hi> (But did God ever make a people without naturall underſtanding? Surely no, but they were a people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpirituall underſtanding, they did not underſtand what the mind, and meaning of God was, and what their owne duty was; Such are a people of no underſtanding, how wiſe ſoever they are in their owne eyes, or in the eyes of the world, what followeth) <hi>Therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will ſhew them no favour;</hi> That is, God who made and formed them, both in their naturall capacity as men, as alſo in their civill and ſpirituall capacity as a Church and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or as a Nationall Church (underſtanding it of the <hi>Jewes</hi>) will not have mercy on them, will not favour them. We read the ſame Church at once looking to God as their maker and moſt earneſtly moving and imploring his pity upon the ſame account. (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 64.8, 9.) <hi>But now O Lord, thou art our father, we are the clay, and thou our potter, and we all are the work of thy hand;</hi> As if they had ſayd, Thou O Lord, haſt moulded us as thy creatures, and faſhioned us as thy Church, when we were but a rude maſſe or heape without forme or comelineſs, therefore doe not marre thy owne worke, doe not breake the veſſels of thine owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or as it followeth in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Be not wroth very ſore O Lord, neither remember iniquity for ever, behold, we beſeech thee, we are all thy people.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, No man ought to looke upon himſelfe as his owne; So the Apoſtle argues (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 6.19.) <hi>Know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your owne;</hi> No man is his owne, he is Gods, who hath made him. Saints and believers eſpecially are not their own in that repſect; as alſo becauſe their bodies <hi>are the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the holy Ghoſt;</hi> that is, the holy Ghoſt hath ſanctified them for himſelfe, for his peculiar ſervice, and for his habitation. Now as the bodyes of Saints are the temple of the holy Ghoſt, becauſe he doth ſanctifie them; ſo they are the temple of the holy Ghoſt, becauſe he hath reared them up, and built them. That conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhould urge us to duty; our bodies are temples built, as well as temples ſanctified by the holy Ghoſt; And therefore we are not our owne at all, nor in any reſpect; and if we are not our owne at all, but the Lords, then we ought to be alwayes for the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Hence, Thirdly, Hath <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> made us? (as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith) then let the Spirit uſe us; how ſad is it, that when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God hath made our bodies and ſoules, we ſhould let the wicked ſpirit uſe either (as he doth both the bodies and ſoules of carnall men) to his baſe ſervices. The evill ſpirit did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make your bodies nor your ſoules, why ſhould he have the command of either? Therefore <hi>as your members have been wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of unrighteouſneſſe to ſin, ſo let them be inſtruments of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe unto God.</hi> Seeing the holy Spirit hath made us, let not the evill ſpirit uſe ſo much as a little finger of us; for, he hath not made not only ſo much as a little finger of our hand, but ſo much as the leaſt haire of our heads (as Chriſt ſaith we our ſelves can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, <hi>Math:</hi> 5.36.) <hi>white or blacke.</hi> And therefore let not the evill ſpirit make uſe of one haire of our heads white or black, as a flagge of pride and vanity, or to be an occaſion of ſin to others. He that maketh the houſe ought to have the poſſeſſion and ſervice of it, either to dwell in it himſelfe, or to receive rent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from him that dwells in it. The ſpirit having made us, ſhould not only have the rent and revenue, but the full poſſeſſion of us for ever. That which is of God ſhould be for God, for him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, and only for him.</p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:104248:92"/>
                  <p>Secondly, In that the making of man is attributed to the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>The Spirit of God is God.</q>
                  <p>The holy Ghoſt is not only a power of God, or a word gone out from God, but the holy Ghoſt is God. This is cleare from the efficiency of the holy Spirit; <hi>The Spirit of God hath made me.</hi> The work of creation is attributable to none but God. That power which at firſt ſet up man in his creation, continueth him to this day; this power and great prerogative is given to the Spirit; therefore the Spirit is God. (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 33.6.) <hi>By the word of the Lord</hi> (his ſubſtantiall Word or Son) <hi>were the heavens made, and all the hoſt of them, by the breath</hi> (or Spirit) <hi>of his mouth;</hi> that is, <hi>Jehovah</hi> by his Eternall Son and Spirit made all things. The heavens and their hoſt, are there expreſſed by a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdoche</hi> of the part, for the whole creation, or, for all creatures both in heaven and in earth. Againe (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 104.30.) <hi>Thou ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt forth thy Spirit, they are created;</hi> The Spirit of God creates every day; what is it that continueth things in their created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but providence? That's a true axiome in Divinity; <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is creation continued;</hi> Now the Spirit of God who created at firſt, creates to this day; <hi>Thou ſendeſt forth thy Spirit, they are created.</hi> The work of creation was finiſhed in the firſt ſix dayes of the world, but the work of creation is renewed every day, and ſo continued to the end of the world. Succeſſive providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall creation as well as originall creation is aſcribed to the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture is full of arguments to prove that the holy Ghoſt is God; Which (becauſe this fundamentall truth is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly ſpoken againſt) I ſhall a little touch upon.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As the Spirit createth and makes the naturall man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of body and ſoule, ſo he regenerateth (which is a greater creation) the whole into a ſpirituall man; therefore he is God. (<hi>John</hi> 3.5.) <hi>Except a man be borne againe of water, and of the Spirit</hi> (that is, of the Spirit who is as water) <hi>he cannot enter into the kingdome of God.</hi> The holy Ghoſt is alſo call'd, <hi>The ſanctifier;</hi> ſanctification is regeneration in progreſs, and motion; regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſanctification begun, and ſanctification is regeneration
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:104248:93"/> perfecting from day to day. (2 <hi>Theſ:</hi> 2.13.) <hi>We are bound to give thanks to God for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, becauſe God hath from the beginning choſen you to ſalvation, through ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the Spirit, and beliefe of the truth.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> writes to the <hi>Elect</hi> (1 Pet: 1, 2.) <hi>according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God the father, through ſanctification of the Spirit.</hi> Now, who can doe theſe great things but God? who can regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or give a new nature, who can ſanctifie or perfect that new nature but God alone? Men and Angels muſt let theſe workes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone for ever, or (as we tranſlate, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 49.8.) theſe acts ceaſe for ever from men and Angels, as much as the redemption of man from the grave, or from hell, from corruption, or condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Spirit is omniſcient, <hi>He knoweth all things,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 1.12. 2 10.19.) <hi>The Spirit knoweth all things, yea the deep things of God.</hi> He is not only acquainted with, and privie to the ſurface and outſide of things, but he ſearcheth things to the bottom of them. Nor doth he ſearch only the deepe or bottome things of common men, or of the chiefeſt of men, Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (whoſe hearts are uſually as much deeper then other mens, as their perſons and places are higher) but the Spirit ſearcheth the deep things, the bottome things of God, the things of God that lye loweſt, and moſt out of ſight, the Spirit underſtandeth; therefore the Spirit is God. For (as the Apoſtle argueth, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2.11.) <hi>No man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of a man that is in him; even ſo the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God,</hi> or, he that is God; if the ſpirit that is in man, were not man, or the intellectuall power in man, it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know the things of man; and if the Spirit of God were not God, he could never ſearch and know the deep, the deepeſt things of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As the Spirit of God knoweth all things, as he ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the deep things, even all the ſecrets, and myſteries of God; ſo he teacheth all things, even all thoſe ſecrets and myſteries of God, which 'tis needful or uſeful for man to know. The Spirit is a teacher, and he teacheth effectually (<hi>Joh:</hi> 16.13.) <hi>When the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelfe</hi> (that is, he ſhall not teach you a private do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or that which is contrary to what ye have learned of me)
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:104248:93"/> 
                     <hi>but whatſoever he ſhall heare, that ſhall he ſpeake, and he will ſhew you things to come.</hi> Which laſt words are</p>
                  <p>A fourth argument that he is God. As the Spirit teacheth, ſo he foretelleth all things (1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 4.1.) <hi>Now the Spirit ſpeaketh expreſſely, that in the latter times ſome ſhall depart from the faith, giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits and doctrines of devills.</hi> The Spirit of God clearly foreſeeth and infallibly foretelleth what ſhall be, before it is, therefore he is God. The Lord by his holy Prophet (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 41.23.) challengeth all the falſe Idol gods of the Heathen to give that proofe of their Divinity; <hi>Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are Gods.</hi> As if he had ſayd, Doe that and we will yield the cauſe. Men and Devills may gueſſe at, but none can indeed ſhew things to come but God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Spirit appoints to himſelfe officers and miniſters in the Church, therefore he is God, (<hi>Acts</hi> 13.2.) <hi>The holy Ghoſt ſaid, ſeparate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The holy Ghoſt furniſheth thoſe Officers whom he calleth with power and gifts, as he pleaſeth, that they may be fit for the work or miniſtery of the Goſpel (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 12.8.11.) <hi>To one is given by the Spirit, the word of wiſdome, to another the word of knowledge by the ſame Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But all theſe worketh that one and the ſelfe-ſame Spirit, dividing to every man ſeverally as he will.</hi> Now, who can give wiſdome and knowledge, who can give them prerogatively, following in this diſtribution, or diviſion of gifts, no rule, nor giving any other reaſon of it but his owne will, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God only?</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The holy Ghoſt is ſinned againſt; therefore he is God. Some, poſſibly may object and ſay, This is not a convincing or demonſtrative argument, that the holy Ghoſt is God, becauſe he is ſinned againſt; For man may ſin againſt man. All ſecond table ſins are ſins againſt our Neighbour; and the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (1 Ep: 8.12.) that while they uſed their lawfull liberty in eating with offence, they <hi>ſinned against the Brethren.</hi> I anſwer, Whoſoever is properly ſinned againſt is God, becauſe God is the Law-giver. And, though many actions of men are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect wrongs to man, yet in every wrong done to man, God alſo is wronged, and, in ſtrict ſence, he only is ſinned againſt by man. For the reaſon why any action is a wrong to man, is becauſe it is
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:104248:94"/> againſt ſome Law of God. And if to be ſinned againſt in ſtrict ſence, be proper to God only; then the argument ſtands good, that the Holy Spirit is God, becauſe he is ſinned againſt; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if we conſider, that there is ſuch an Emphaſis put upon ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt the holy Ghoſt in the holy Scripture (more if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then upon ſinning againſt the Father, or the Son) (<hi>Math:</hi> 12.31.) <hi>Wherefore, I ſay unto you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>All manner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men, but the blaſphemy againſt the holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto men;</hi> As if he had ſaid, Though you ſin againſt the Father, and the Son, it ſhall be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you, but if you ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt it ſhall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given either in this world or in the world to come; that is, it ſhall never be forgiven. Seeing then there is more in ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Ghoſt then againſt the Father, or the Son, who are God, the holy Ghoſt muſt needs be God. For though there is no degree or graduall difference in the deity, each perſon being coeternall, coequall, and conſubſtantiall; yet the Scripture attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes more in that caſe, as to the poynt of ſinning againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, then to ſinning againſt the Father, or the Son; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly the holy Ghoſt is God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The holy Ghoſt is the object of divine worſhip; are not we baptized <hi>in the Name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghost?</hi> Is the Father, and the Son God, and the holy Ghoſt not God, who is joyned with them in the ſame honour? Shall a creature come in competition with God? And doth not the Scripture or word of God, direct us to pray for grace from the Spirit as well as from the Father or the Son? (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 13.13. <hi>Rev:</hi> 1.4.) Thus we ſee how full the Scripture is in giving the glory of the ſame workes upon us, and of the ſame worſhip from us to the Spirit, as to the Father and the Son: And therefore from all theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes we may conclude, That the Holy-Ghoſt with the Father and the Son, is God bleſſed and to be glorified for evermore. <hi>The Spirit of God hath made me,</hi>
                     <q>And the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</q>
                  </p>

                     </note>The words carry an alluſion (as Interpreters generally agree) to that of <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribing the creation of man (<hi>Gen:</hi> 2.7.) <hi>And the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the earth, and breathed into his noſtrills the breath of life, and man became a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:104248:94"/> ſoule. Elihu</hi> ſpeakes neere in the ſame forme, fully to the ſame effect; <hi>The breath of the Almighty hath given me life,</hi> or, <hi>enlivened me;</hi> As if he had ſayd, That ſoule which the Lord hath breathed into me, hath made me live. The ſoule of man may be called the breath of the Almighty, becauſe the Almighty is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed infuſing it into man at firſt by breathing. And therefore the word <hi>Neſhamah,</hi> which properly ſignifies the breath, doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by a Metonymie of the effect ſignifie the ſoule it ſelfe which cauſeth breathing. Thus our tranſlaters render it (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 57.16.) <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>will not contend for ever, neither will I be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes wroth, for the ſpirit ſhould faile before me, and the ſoules which I have made.</hi> As the ſoule of man was breathed in by God, ſo the ſoule is that by which man breathes. Breath and ſoule come and goe together. Some comparing the originall word <hi>(Shamaijm)</hi> for the heavens, with this word <hi>(Neſhamah)</hi> which here we tranſlate <hi>breath,</hi> take notice of their neere affinity, intimating that the ſoule of man is of a heavenly pedegree, or comes from heaven; yea the latine word <hi>(mens)</hi> ſignifying the <hi>mind,</hi> is of the ſame conſonant letters with the Hebrew <hi>Neſhamah,</hi> and, as ſome conceive, is derived from it.</p>
                  <p>So then, I take theſe words, <hi>The breath of the Almighty,</hi> as a deſcription of that part of man which is oppoſed to his body; <hi>The Spirit of God hath made me;</hi> that is, hath ſet me up as a man, in humane ſhape, <hi>And the breath of the Almighty hath given me life;</hi> that is, this ſoule which the Almighty hath breathed into me, hath made me a living man, ready for any humane act, or (as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeakes) <hi>God breathing into my noſtrills the breath of life, I became a living ſoule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſoule of man floweth immediately from God.</q>
                  <p>'Tis the breath of God; not that God liveth by breathing; the way of his life is infinitely above our apprehenſion; But 'tis cleare in Scripture, That the Almighty breathed into man the powers of life. And therefore he is called (by way of Eminence) <hi>The father of ſpirits,</hi> (Heb: 12.9.) For though the Almighty is rightly entituled the Father of the whole man, though both body and ſoule are the worke of God, yet he is in a further ſence, the father of our ſpirits, or ſoules, then of our bodyes. And here
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:104248:95"/> 
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhewing how man is diſpoſed of when theſe two are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by death, ſaith (<hi>Eccl:</hi> 12.7.) <hi>Then ſhall the duſt</hi> (that is, the body) <hi>returne to the earth as it was, and the ſpirit</hi> (that is, the ſoule) <hi>ſhall returne to God who gave it.</hi> The body is the gift of God, but the body is not the breath of God, it is not ſuch an immediate gift of God as the ſoule is; when the body of man was made at firſt, God tooke the duſt of the earth and formed his body out of it, but when he gave him a ſoule, he breathed that from himſelfe; it was an immediate effect of Gods power, not dealing with, nor working upon any prae-exiſting matter. The ſpirit or ſoule of man is purely of God, ſolely of God. And hence we may inferre.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Then the ſoule is not a vapour, ariſing from the craſis or temperament of the body, as the life of a beaſt is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Then the ſoule of man is not traduced from the parents in generation, as many learned men affirme, eſpecially, to eaſe themſelves of thoſe difficulties about the conveyance of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſin or defilement into the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We may hence alſo inferre, then the ſoule is not corruptible; it is an immortall ſubſtance. How can that be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible or mortall, which hath its riſe (as I may ſay) immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from God, or is breathed in by the Almighty, who is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether incorruptible and immortal. And whereas there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold incorruptibility; Firſt, by divine ordination, that is, God appoynts ſuch a thing ſhall not corrupt, and therefore it doth not; ſo the body of man in it's firſt creation was incorruptible, for though it were in it ſelfe corruptible, being made out of the earth, yet by the appoyntment of God, if man had continued in his integrity he had not dyed. And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>By ſin came death;</hi> yea doubtleſſe if God ſhould command and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt the meaneſt worme that moves upon the earth to live for ever, or the moſt fading flower that groweth out of the earth to flouriſh for ever, both the one and the other would doe ſo. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, there is an incorruptibility in ſome things, not meerely by a law or appoyntment of God, but as from that intrinſecall nature, which God hath beſtowed upon them, and implanted in them. Thus the Angels are immortall, they have an incorruptible nature, and likewiſe the ſoule of man, being breathed from the Almighty, is in it's owne nature incorruptible; it hath naturally
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:104248:95"/> no ſeedes of diſſolution in it, becauſe no contrariety, no contrary qualities in it, as all bodyes or corporeall ſubſtances have. I know the Apoſtle ſaith (1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 6.16.) <hi>God only hath immortality;</hi> it's true, he only hath it in himſelfe independently, originally; but he derives and gives it as a talent to ſome creatures in a way of dependance upon himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>The ſoule brings in the life of the body, The life of man.</q>
                  <p>What is the body without the ſoule, but a lumpe of clay; As ſoone as ever the ſoule departs, life departs, man dyeth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a putrifying carkaſſe; yet ſuch is the folly of moſt men, that all their care is for the life of the body, which is (at beſt) a dying life, they utterly neglect the ſoule, which, as it is the life of the body, ſo it ſelfe never dyeth. The ſoule is the Jewell, the body is but the Cabinet, the ſoule is the kernel, the body is but the ſhell. Will you be ſollicitous, about a Cabinet, and a ſhell, and ſlight the Jewel, or throw away the kernel? Will you take care of that which liveth, the body, and will you not take care of that which holds your life, the ſoule?</p>
                  <p>Againe, Note.</p>
                  <q>Life is the gift of God.</q>
                  <p>If the ſoule which is the cauſe of life in man, be of God, then the life of man is of God alſo. The cauſe of the cauſe is the cauſe of the effect or thing cauſed. But we need not argue it from Logick rules, Scripture teſtimony being ſo aboundant in this thing. (<hi>Acts</hi> 17.25.) <hi>He giveth to all, life and breath, and all things.</hi> And (<hi>v.</hi> 28.) <hi>In him we live and move and have our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Spirituall and eternall life, are the gift of God, ſo alſo is naturall life. And if ſo, Then</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Live to God; Secondly, Seeing God gives us life, we ſhould be willing to give our lives to God. Yea Thirdly, We ſhould therefore be ready to give up, or rather to lay downe our lives for God. And as we ſhould give up our lives to God when he calls for them by natural death, ſo we ſhould give up our lives for God, when he calls us to beare witneſs to his name and truth by violent death.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall yet take notice of one thing further, before I paſſe from
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:104248:96"/> this verſe; <hi>The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some, upon good grounds, referre the firſt clauſe; <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God hath made me,</hi> to the creation both of ſoule and body; and the ſecond or latter clauſe, <hi>the breath of the Almighty hath given me life,</hi> to that quickning which we receive by the Spirit to the duties whereinto we are called in this life. The breath of the Almighty hath given me life; that is, hath fitted and prepared me for the ſeverall offices and ſervices of life. As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſayd, <hi>The Spirit of God hath not only made me a man, but a man for worke, yea the Spirit of God hath quickned me to the preſent worke and buſineſſe I am come about.</hi> Thus, life imports not only ſpirituall life in the being of it, but all the furniture, ornaments, and abilities of a ſpirituall life.

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>God giveth not only the life of nature unto men, but he fits them for all the duties, and ſervices of this life.</q>
                  <p>We, indeed, are ſcarcely to be reckoned among the living, if we have no more but a naturall life; what is it to be able to eate and drinke, to heare, and ſee, and ſpeake; unleſſe we have more then this, we deſerve not to be numbred or written among the living; we are upon the matter, but dead lumps, and clods of clay. It is the breath of the Almighty that quickens us and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradds ability to doe good, that frames, faſhions, and fits us for every good word, and worke; <hi>This is the life of man;</hi> when a man is fitted for duty, and ſervice, when he is furniſhed for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, to ſtand God, and his Brethren in ſome ſtead while he is in this world, then he lives. The motions, impulſes and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:104248:96"/> the teachings and guidings of the Spirit of God, are the life of our lives. We can doe nothing of our ſelves, till the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty beſtows a new life upon us; and as we can doe nothing at all in ſpiritualls, till he gives us a new life, ſo we can do nothing to purpoſe till the Spirit acts &amp; ſtirres up that life in us. It is the Spirit who firſt beſtows; Secondly, encreaſeth; Thirdly, excites our ſpirituall life, &amp; puts the new creature into motion. All our good thoughts and holy actings, all our uprightneſſe and ſincerity, all our ſtrength and ability flow from the Spirit; untill the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit workes in us, we ſit ſtill; and when the Spirit worketh, we muſt not ſit ſtill; <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom:</hi> 15.18.) <hi>will not dare to ſpeak of any of thoſe things, which Chriſt hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient by word, and deed;</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>My owne workes are not worth the naming, I will not ſo much as mention any thing that Chriſt hath not wrought in me by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> That was a mighty worke which he was enabled to doe, to make the Gentiles obedient in word, and deed. Chriſt did not leave him to doe it in his owne power. The breath of the Almighty enabled him; and ſo he doth all thoſe that are able and willing, ready for and ſucceſſefull in any ſuch holy worke.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore aſcribe all to his working and quickening; let us ſet down our ſeverall Items of receit in our account-books, confeſſing that we have nothing of our own. This gift, that grace, that ability to doe, to ſpeake, to ſuffer, to act, we have received from him. Let the whole Inventory of our ſoules riches, have Gods name written upon it, and aſcribed to his praiſe alone. And if we thus uncloath our ſelves, by giving God the glory of all, we ſhall looſe nothing by it, for God will apparrell and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us, deck and adorne us better every day. The poorer we are in our ſelves, the richer will he make us. To be thus diminiſh't is the beſt way to our encreaſe. 'Tis the breath of the Almighty that teacheth us, and if we can but humbly enough, that is, heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily acknowledge it, we ſhall be taught and learne enough.</p>
                  <p>So much of theſe words as they are a direct aſſertion. I ſhall conſider them a little in their connection, and reference both to what went before, and to that which follows after; which was the ſecond conſideration of this verſe at firſt propoſed,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This verſe may be connected with the three former verſes, and then the ſence appeareth thus; As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſayd,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:104248:97"/> 
                     <hi>O Job, I have moved thee to heare me patiently, and attentively, and let it not ſeeme grievous to thee to doe ſoe; For, though I am thy inferiour in age, and degree, yet I am a man as well as thou, and I have a ſoule and body like thine, yea the Spirit of God that made me, hath alſo furniſhed me; I have rceeived ability from God as thou haſt, I ſtand upon even ground, or equall termes with thee, as to creation, and I am not altogether voyd of inſtruction; and therefore as a man I have a poſſibility to underſtand reaſon; and as a man indowed by the Spirit of God, I have a capability to direct thee about the wayes of God, or how to underſtand and comport with his providences towards thee. Thou haſt been long under the hand of God, and long in the hands of men, who have rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled and troubled thy mind then eaſed it; who knowes but that I, who all this while have been but a looker on, may ſee ſomewhat in thy caſe, which hath hitherto been hid from thy former underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. Therefore pray favour me (it may prove in the iſſue a favour to thy ſelfe) with an houre or two of patient attention.</hi> Take this note from it.</p>
                  <q>The conſideration of our common originall, that we have all one maker, or are all come out of the hand of God, ſhould make us willing to heare, and learne of one another.</q>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> argueth; <hi>Heare me;</hi> why? <hi>Becauſe the Spirit of God hath made me, as well as thee;</hi> doe not deſpiſe what I have to ſay, as if you were a man of another mould, or pedigree, the ſame God, out of the ſame matter, by the ſame Word, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, hath form'd us both. Some pictures are more highly prized then others of the ſame perſon, becauſe drawne by a better hand, by An <hi>Apelles,</hi> or A <hi>Michael Angelo.</hi> The fame of the Artiſt or workman puts a value upon the worke; And the title of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour doth ſometimes commend a piece more then, in truth, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the forme or matter. But come among the ſons of men, all their faces and features are drawne by one hand; The ſame moſt exact hand of God hath wrought and faſhioned them all, both as to their outſide, and inſide, both as to the forme of theſe houſes of clay, and as to all the ornaments and beautifyings of them. As we all walke upon the ſame earth, drinke out of the ſame wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, breath in the ſame ayre, as we are all covered with the ſame Canopy of heaven, and lighted with the ſame Sun, ſo we are all
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:104248:97"/> made with the ſame hand; The Spirit of God hath made one as well as another; This man hath not had a better pencill nor a more skilfull Limner then that. Thus we may argue from the common condition of man in nature, to a mutuall condiſcenſion among men. Indeed Chriſtians, who have higher principles, have alſo higher topicks &amp; arguments then that, why they ſhould condeſcend one to another; and (as the Apoſtle directs, <hi>Eph:</hi> 4.4, 5, 6.) <hi>Keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace.</hi> Saints ſhould <hi>be lowly and meeke with long-ſuffering, forbearing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in love,</hi> (as the Apoſtle there exhorts) not only becauſe one hand hath made all their bodyes, but becauſe they are one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; though they are many naturall bodyes, yet one myſticall body; <hi>There is one body, and one ſpirit;</hi> As one Spirit hath made them, ſo they are made one ſpirit; <hi>There is alſo</hi> (as it followeth) <hi>one hope, one Lord, one faith, one Baptiſme, one God, and father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</hi> How ſhould all Saints be one, who are comprehended and united under this ſeven-fold oneneſs. That we have all one maker in nature, is a very moving argument to meekneſs, love, and unity, but that all believers are made one by Grace, is a much more moving argument.</p>
                  <p>Againe, We may conſider theſe words in connexion with the three following verſes, and then, as in connection with the former, they are a prevention of <hi>Job's</hi> pride, ſo in this, they are a prevention of his feare, or an encouragement of him to a chearfull hearing of what <hi>Elihu</hi> had to ſay. <hi>Job</hi> had been dealt ſeverely with by his three friends, and the terror of God was upon him, he was under much diſpondency of ſpirit. Now (ſaith <hi>Elihu) Anſwer me if thou canſt, ſtand up, ſet thy words in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, for the Spirit of God hath made me, and given me life; I am a creature, and I am but a creature, I am no more then thou art, I am made of God, and thou art made of God as well as I, I was made out of the duſt, as thou art; I am not God to terrifie thee, but I am ſent of God, to counſel and comfort thee; my hand ſhall not be heavie upon thee, I promiſe to deale tenderly with thee, I am ſuch a one as thy ſelfe, as I am not worſe, ſo I am not better, we ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like together in this diſpute; therefore thou mayeſt freely come forth, and anſwer me, who am but a poore creature, as thy ſelfe is.</hi> Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> beſpeakes <hi>Job</hi> in the ſixth and ſeventh verſes; <hi>If thou canſt
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:104248:98"/> anſwer me, ſet thy words in order before me, ſtand up, Behold, I am according to thy wiſh. Speake freely, and cleare thy ſelfe, if thou art able, thou haſt free leave for me.</hi>

                  <p>This verſe may have a four-fold reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To the inſufficiency, or incompetency of <hi>Job's</hi> parts and intellectuals to deale with <hi>Elihu</hi> in this matter; as if they were a daring challenge, Anſwer me if thou canſt, doe thy worſt. And hence ſome of the Ancients charge <hi>Elihu,</hi> as if he came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Job</hi> boaſtingly, and ſpake thus in the pride of his owne ſpirit, and in the diſdaine of <hi>Job,</hi> at once to ſhew and ſlight his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>If thou canſt anſwer me.</hi> As if (like ſome irrefragable Doctor) he had ſaid; <hi>I ſhall ſpeak ſuch reaſon, as I know thou canst not anſwer; doe what thou canſt, ſet all thy wits aworke, and beate thy braines as much as thou wilt, thou wilt but looſe thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and weary thy ſelfe in vaine.</hi> Thus the meaning of, <hi>Anſwer me if thou canſt,</hi> is, <hi>Thou canſt not anſwer.</hi> But I ſuppoſe <hi>Elihu,</hi> (though hot ſpirited enough) was yet of a better ſpirit &amp; temper then to ſpeak either thus proudly of himſelfe, or deſpiſingly of ſo worthy a man as he had before him; nor did <hi>Elihu</hi> look upon <hi>Job</hi> as ſuch a puny to him, or ſo much his underling as that he durſt not hold up the Bucklers in diſpute againſt him. <hi>Elihu</hi> knew <hi>Job</hi> was an old experienced Souldier, well verſ'd in the wayes and things of God. And therefore</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>(If thou canſt)</hi> may rather referre to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſoareneſſe of <hi>Job's</hi> body, to the wounds or troubles which he had received and felt from the Almighty in his ſpirit, then to any inability of his mind for argument. As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid; <hi>I conſider how it is with thee, thou art a man diſeaſed and diſtempered in thy body, fitter to lye upon or keep thy bed, then to ſtand up to a diſpute, fitter for a hoſpitall then for the Schooles. Thou alſo haſt a troubled and an afflicted ſpirit, I doubt thou art not in caſe to anſwer me, or to ſtand up longer in a way of diſpute; but this I ſay, if thou canſt anſwer me, pray doe: ſet thy words in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me. I will not lay this burden upon thee, unleſſe thou art wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take it, unleſſe thou findeſt thou haſt ſtrength and ſpirit to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:104248:98"/> beare and carry it through. Anſwer me if thou canſt, otherwiſe I will ſpeak my thoughts out, and make what uſe of it thou pleaſeſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I conceive <hi>Elihu</hi> might here intend to let <hi>Job</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that he was reſolved to put him to the utmoſt, that he was reſolved to bring the ſtrongeſt arguments, and uſe the quickeſt way of reaſoning for his conviction that he could; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he alſo adviſeth <hi>Job</hi> to doe the like, to doe his beſt, to buckle himſelfe to the buſineſſe with all his might, for he was not come to dally with him: he would have him ſet his ſhoulders to the work, and gather all the forces of his ſoule to the battaile, he bids him bring forth even his horſemen for his defence (as I may ſpeak in alluſion to that in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Jeremy; If thou haſt run with footmen, and they have wearied thee, how ſhalt thou contend with horſes) Elihu</hi> was purpoſed and reſolved to bring out his greateſt ſtrength, his horſemen to the battaile, and therefore wiſheth <hi>Job</hi> doe ſo too. Thus he gives him faire warning, <hi>If thou canſt, anſwer me;</hi> doe thy utmoſt, I am ready for thee.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, While <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>If thou canſt, anſwer me, ſet thy words in order before me, ſtand up.</hi> We may take his words as a gentle and ſweete invitation to the worke; As if he had ſayd, <hi>If thou haſt ſpirits enow left to hold diſcourſe with me, or to reply upon me, come friend, ſpare me not, ſet thy words in order before me, I will not be a terror to thee.</hi> Or there may be this condeſcending ſence in theſe words of <hi>Elihu; Doe not thinke (O Job) becauſe I begin to ſpeak, that therefore I meane to ſpeak all, or to have all the diſcourſe my ſelfe; aſſure thy ſelfe, I have no purpoſe to hinder thee in any defence, which thou art able to make for thy ſelfe: No, though I am come with my beſt preparations to urge thee, and reply upon thee, as to all that hath past between thee and thy friends, yet I am as willing that thou ſhouldeſt anſwer, as I am ready prepared and preſt to ſpeake; thou hast free leave to make thy Apologie, to ſay what thou canſt for thy ſelfe, I intend not to impoſe upon thee, nor by any Authority to compell thee to ſtand to my ſentence, as if I were thy Maſter, or would Lord it over thee; Doe and ſpeake thy beſt for thy owne vindication, I am ready to receive it from thee, and give thee a faire account of my thoughts about it. If thou canſt, anſwer me,</hi>
                     <q>Set thy words in order before me.</q>
                  </p>

                     </note> often and moſt properly uſed for
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:104248:99"/> the marſhalling of an Army; and ſo is elegantly applyed here in this matter of controverſie, or polemicall diſcourſe. <hi>Set thy words,</hi> thy reaſons, thy arguments, as it were in battaile aray againſt me; we had the word in the former Chapter at the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe. It is applyed alſo to the exactneſs of the heart in prayer, not an affected exactneſs or curioſity about words, or to word it with God, but it notes exactneſs or ſpirituallneſs rather in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating and diſpoſing the ſtrongeſt Scripture reaſonings, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with God in prayer. Prayer is, as it were, a battaile fought in heaven, not in wroth or revenge, but with faith and holy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Thus did <hi>Jacob</hi> when he wraſtled with the Angel, (<hi>Gen:</hi> 32.) And thus <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 5.3.) <hi>In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I will direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up,</hi> or, <hi>I will mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall my prayer,</hi> I will bring up petition after petition, pleading after pleading, even till I am become like <hi>Jacob</hi> a Prince with God, till I have won the field, and got the day. Thus the word is applyed by a metaphor both to diſputations with men, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to God. Further, we may take the meaning plainly without any ſtraine of rhetorique, <hi>Set thy words in order before me.</hi> Methode is good in every thing, either an expreſſe or a covert methode. Sometimes 'tis the beſt of art to cover it; in ſpeaking there is a ſpeciall uſe of methode; for, though, as one ſaid very well (ſpeaking of thoſe who are more curious about methode, then ſerious about matter) <hi>Methode never converted any man;</hi> yet methode and the ordering of words, is very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Our ſpeeches ſhould not be heaps of words, but words bound up, not a throng of words, but words ſet in aray, or, as it were, in ranke and file. The Prophet (<hi>Joel</hi> 2.5.) deſcribes a terrible Judgement of God <hi>by a ſtrong people ſet in battaile aray.</hi> In purſuance of which ſence, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Broughton</hi> renders the next words, not (as we) <hi>ſtand up,</hi> but <hi>ſtand to it,</hi> as Commanders ſay to their Souldiers, <hi>ſtand to it;</hi> and the <hi>Italian</hi> tranſlation thus; <hi>Set thy words in order before me, preſent thy ſelfe to the Combate.</hi> Thus he continues the metaphor; As if he had ſaid; <hi>Chuſe thy ground,</hi>

The Apoſtle (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 16.13.) ſpeaks in that language
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:104248:99"/> about our ſpirituall warre; <hi>Watch ye, ſtand faſt,</hi>

                     <hi>quit your ſelves like men; man it,</hi> be ſtrong. There is ſuch a ſence in <hi>Elihu's</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation here to <hi>Job; Set thy words in order before me, ſtand up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, in that <hi>Elihu</hi> when he was thus bent to ſpeak, and was ſo full of matter to ſpeak, that as he tells us in the former chapter, <hi>He was like bottles of wine, and that he could not hold,</hi> yet gave <hi>Job</hi> faire law, and bids him anſwer, if he could.</p>
                  <p>Note Firſt.</p>
                  <q>In all matters of difference we ſhould be as willing to heare what others can anſwer, as we are deſirous that others ſhould heare what we can object.</q>
                  <p>If thou canſt, anſwer me. It is good to ſpeak in a right cauſe, eſpecially to ſpeak rightly, and it is very good to learne what can be anſwered.</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Elihu</hi> looking upon <hi>Job</hi> as a man in a weake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſpeaks incouragingly, <hi>ſtand up;</hi> as much as to ſay, <hi>Take heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>It is our duty to refreſh thoſe that are troubled, or to comfort thoſe that are weake, whether in body or in minde.</q>
                  <p>We ſhould doe our beſt to put ſtrength and infuſe ſpirits into ſinking hearts and fainting ſpirits. Thus <hi>God dwells</hi> (Iſa: 57.51. and ſo ſhould we) <hi>with him that is of a contrite and humble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As theſe words, <hi>If thou canst, anſwer me,</hi> import that as <hi>Elihu</hi> intended to put <hi>Job</hi> to the utmoſt, ſo he would have <hi>Job</hi> beſtirre himſelfe to the utmoſt.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>Every man ſhould doe his beſt for the clearing or maintaining of a good and righteous cauſe.</q>
                  <p>'Tis ſinfull to be ſlight in matters of moment. <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to doe, doe it with all thy might</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ: 9.10.) we ſhould eſpecially doe theſe two things with all our might; Firſt, maintaine the truth of God; Secondly, our

There is nothing more unworthy a man, much more a Chriſtian, then to leave either truth, or our own integrity to ſinke or ſwim, to ſhift for themſelves. Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> provokes <hi>Job</hi> to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and ſends him a friendly challenge, which leſt he ſhould refuſe or not accept, he gives him a comfortable account (as a cordiall) what manner of man he ſhould find him to be, even a man moulded and modell'd to his owne heart, or minted to his mind, as will appeare in the next verſe.</p>

If ever a man will ſpeak when he comes to a buſineſſe, it is when things and perſons are according to his wiſh. <hi>Job</hi> had oftentimes wiſht that he might be mildly heard by God, &amp; not ſo harſhly dealt with by man; his friends having been ſo over-ſevere and rigorous toward him, that he was even compelled in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of his ſoule, to cry out, <hi>He that is afflicted, ſhould have pitty from his friends.</hi> Yea, when <hi>Job</hi> wiſht to be heard by God, he, with much earneſtneſſe deprecated his ſeverity, (<hi>Chap:</hi> 9. 34. and <hi>Chap:</hi> 13. 24.) <hi>Let not thy dread make me afraid.</hi> Thus, <hi>Job</hi> had wiſht for a milde and gentle treatment from all hands. In anſwer to which deſire <hi>Elihu</hi> preſents himſelfe to him.</p>
                  <q>Behold, I am according to thy wiſh in Gods ſtead.</q>
                  <p>Thoſe words <hi>(According to thy wiſh)</hi> may have a two-fold interpretation; Firſt, as we render, <hi>according to thy wiſh,</hi> is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what thou haſt heretofore ſpoken or drawne out in wiſhes; thou haſt thy vote, thy wiſh, and what wouldſt thou have more. As if he had ſaid; <hi>O Job, I have heard thee wiſhing ſuch wiſhes, that thou mighteſt be more tenderly handled; that God would not oppreſſe thee with his Majeſty, nor thy friends with their ſeverity. Now thou haſt thy deſire, I doe here promiſe my ſelfe ſuch
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:104248:100"/> a one to thee as thou hast deſired; For as I will be a faithfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for God, ſo, I, who am in Gods ſtead, will not (as thou hast prayed God would not at the hearing of thy caſe) be terrible nor dreadfull to thee; I doubt not but to carry the matter with thee to thy hearts content. I am according to thy wiſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>Wee ſhould labour as much as in us lieth to anſwer the deſires and wiſhes of others in all things lawfull, eſpecially when they are weak and labouring under ſore burthens of affliction and infirmity.</q>
                  <p>It is not good to be croſſe-grain'd at any time to our brethren, much leſſe at ſuch a time; ſome love (as it were) to lie thwart in every buſineſſe, nor is any thing more deſireable to them, then to oppoſe another mans deſire. The ſweetneſſe and ingenuity of theſe words, <hi>I am according to your wiſh,</hi> in what I ſafely may, is ſeldome heard among brethren. Some indeed are too forward to be according to the wiſh of others in things that are ſinfull. When theeves and murderers ſay to them, <hi>Come, come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurke privily for the innocent without cauſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Caſt in your lot among us, let us all have one purſe;</hi> They ſay, we are according to your wiſh, we will goe with you. When the prophane ſay, come run with us into all exceſſe of riot, to drunkenneſs and uncleanneſs, they anſwer, we are according to your wiſh, we are for you. It is good to lie croſſe to the ſinfull deſires of men; but to comply with their honeſt deſires, and to anſwer every good wiſh of their ſoules, is a great part of our goodneſſe, and of our fulfilling the law of love: we ſhould ſtrive in that ſence, to fall in with every ones wiſh, and to become all things to all men, both for their edification and conſolation. <hi>Behold, I am according to thy wiſh.</hi>

                     </gap>os the mouth or meaſure of any other man: in that God only tranſcends the meaſure of all men; <hi>My thoughts are not as your thoughts, nor my wayes as your wayes; but look as the heavens are high above the earth, ſo my thoughts are above your thoughts, and my wayes above your wayes,</hi> ſaith the Lord (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.8, 9.) But the wayes of one man are like the wayes of other men, and the thoughts of one man are like the thoughts of other men; There is no ſuch tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendency among men; They are all (as men) of one meaſure, that is, not only finite, but they are all ſhort and narrow, even they who carry the greateſt length and breadth among the ſons of men. If we conſider man with man, as to his ſinfull condition, ſo one man is perfectly like another; one man is of the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with another; as <hi>Solomon</hi> expreſſeth it (<hi>Prov:</hi> 27.19.) <hi>As in water face anſwers face, ſo the heart of man to man.</hi> If man look downe into the water, that face which he ſeeth in the water is like
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:104248:101"/> that face which ſeeth the water. Thus the hearts of the children of men anſwer one another, heart anſwers heart, as face anſwers face: And as man anſwers man fully, as to naturall ſinfulneſſe, ſo moſtly as to naturall abilities, as for thoſe which are acquired, though the difference may be ſo great that one man may be clearly diſcerned to excell another, yet that man who excells moſt, doth not exceed man; and therefore may be compaſſed by man. It is ſaid (<hi>Rev:</hi> 21.17.) That the wall of the new <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem was meaſured according to the meaſure of a man, that is, of the Angel.</hi> There is one meaſure of an Angel, and there is another meaſure of a man; Angels have a meaſure above men; why then doth he ſay according to the meaſure of a man, that is, of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel? I anſwer, he ſpeakes ſo becauſe the Angel appeared in the ſhape of a man, to doe that worke. Now as the meaſure (that is, the Ability) of an Angel is above mans; So God hath a meaſure infinitely above both men and Angels. But men are of a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>I am according to thy mouth or meaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Man and man are of a meaſure.</q>
                  <p>Let us not make a God of any man, no nor an Angel. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Jude</hi> reproves thoſe who had the perſons of men in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Men will be leſſe to us then was expected, if we expect too much from them, or more from them, then is meete. For though one man may have a little more height and largeneſſe of parts and gifts, in that which is either acquired or infuſed, then his neighbour, yet what man is there in the world, but hath his match, &amp; ſhall finde his meaſure in ſome other men; yea, though ſome men exceedingly out-goe others, yet their equalls may be found among men, no man out-goes all men: The beſt of men have but the meaſure of a man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take this Caution from it; <hi>Let no man make a God of himſelfe, or look upon himſelfe as if he were in his meaſure beyond all other men.</hi> We are very apt to doe ſo. And if we have but little more then ſome others, we are ready to thinke we have more then all others, or to look upon our ſelves as if we tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the meaſure of mankinde, and ſo ſwell preſently with pride and ſelfe-conceit; then which nothing is more uncomely or unmanly. Not a few eſteeme themſelves ſo unparalell'd in the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104248:102"/> parts and beauty of their bodies, that they deſpiſe others, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doe it in reference to the endowments and abilities of their minds; they have ſuch a quickneſſe of underſtanding, ſuch a ſtrength of memory, ſuch a fluency of ſpeech, ſuch a depth of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſuch power of arguing, as they ſuppoſe none can match them or meaſure with them. All ſuch have forgotten that they are but men. Therefore as no man ſhould admire another, ſo let him not thinke highly of himſelfe, let him rather thinke that though poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly there are ſome below him, yet there may be many, yea a great many more above him, and enow that are upon the ſame levell with him. <hi>I am according to thy wiſh or meaſure,</hi> ſaith <hi>Elihu.</hi>

                  <p>'Tis enough to make all the Miniſters of Chriſt tremble and cry out in the Apoſtles words, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:104248:102"/> to remember that when they ſpeake to men, they ſpeake in Gods ſtead. <hi>We</hi> (ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5.20.) <hi>are Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors for Christ, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be yee reconciled to God.</hi> Thus ſpake he who had indeed an immediate call and commiſſion from God; and they who have not ſuch an immediate call and commiſſion as he had, yet ſpeaking of or about the things of God; and coming in the name of God, they ſhould ſpeake as placed in Gods ſtead. And if the Miniſters of Chriſt ought to ſpeake as in Gods ſtead, then ſurely they that heare, ſhould heare them as ſpeaking in Gods ſtead. The Apoſtle teſtifies of the <hi>Galathians</hi> (Gal: 4.14.) <hi>My temptation which was in my fleſh ye deſpiſed not, nor rejected, but received me as an Angel of God, even as Christ Jeſus.</hi> Ye received me not only as an Angel or meſſenger of Chriſt, but as if Chriſt had been there in perſon, ſo did ye receive me. He gives the ſame teſtimony of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> (1 Theſ: 2.13.) <hi>For this cauſe alſo thanke we God without ceaſing, becauſe when ye received the word of God, which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of man, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, which effectually worketh alſo in you that beleeve.</hi> I doe not ſay, that what every man ſpeaketh about the things of God, is preſently to be taken for the word of God, or as if God ſpake it. But if that be his ſcope and purpoſe, if that be his Theame and his buſineſſe, if that be the ſubject matter and ſubſtance of his ſpeech, Then he (as to the body of his ſpeech) is to be lookt upon as uttering the word and minde of God in Gods ſtead. 'Tis a very great means to advance our profit in hearing the word, when they who ſpeak it are lookt upon as ſpeaking in Gods ſtead, and not bringing an errand of their owne.</p>
                  <p>Before I paſſe from this firſt clauſe of the verſe, I ſhall briefely touch two other readings and interpretations of it.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Some render thoſe latter words not <hi>in Gods ſtead</hi> as we, But, <hi>in reſpect of God.</hi> As if he had ſaid, In reſpect of God, I ſtand in the ſame proportion, or upon the ſame terms with thy
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:104248:103"/> ſelfe, for he is the God of us both, nor did God make me of any better or more excellent matter then thou art made of; which he fully expreſſeth in the cloſe of the verſe, as it followeth.</p>
                  <q>I alſo am formed out of the Clay.</q>
                  <p>Theſe words are another argument (as was ſhewed when I gave the proſpect of the whole Context) why <hi>Job</hi> ſhould heare <hi>Elihu;</hi> I am in Gods ſtead indeed, but I am a poore creature, moulded out of the duſt, made up of earth, as thou art; <hi>I alſo am formed out of the Clay;</hi> therefore ſtand up, anſwer me, and feare not; anſwer me and ſpare not. The higheſt and holyeſt that ever diſpenced the minde of God, in Gods ſtead, to his Church and people here on earth, were made of earth, and were formed out of Clay. The Apoſtle makes that humble confeſſion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and fellow-Apoſtles (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 4.6.) <hi>We have this treaſure in earthen veſſels, that the excellency of the power might be of God.</hi> The weakneſs of the inſtrument lifts up the glory of the ſuperior agent. They who by commiſſion are the Miniſters of God, and ſo in Gods ſtead, are yet but, as other men, in their naturall ſtructure and conſtitution. (<hi>Acts</hi> 10.26.) when <hi>Cornelius</hi> gave too much reſpect, a kinde of Adoration to <hi>Peter,</hi> he forbad him, ſaying, <hi>Stand up, I alſo am a man.</hi> As if he had ſaid with <hi>Elihu,</hi> I am formed out of the clay as well as thee. There is a reſpect due to the perſons of men, and much more to the Meſſengers of God, yet too much may ſoone be given; I will none of that, ſaith <hi>Peter; I alſo am a man.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> (Acts 14.15.) when the people were ſo hightned in their ignorant reſpects, that they would have ſacrificed to them, as Gods, <hi>They rent their cloathes</hi> (as in caſe of blaſphemy) <hi>and ran in among the people, crying out and ſaying, Sirs, why doe ye theſe things?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> uſed this expreſſion, to aſſure <hi>Job</hi> that he would deale very tenderly with him; What, doſt thou think, that I who am a piece of clay will inſult over thee, who art as good a piece of clay as I? why ſhould one earthen veſſel daſh hard upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? When we are tempted to pride in our ſelves, let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that we are clay, when we are provoked to anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our brethren, or to any harſh and rigorous dealing with them, let us remember that we alſo are clay, that our pedigree and our ſtock is from the duſt as well as others. If our feet be but a little fouled, we think our ſelves ſomewhat humbled by it, if but a little dirt ſtick to our ſhoes, or hang about our cloaths, we are ſomewhat aſhamed of our ſelves, yet the truth is, we are all duſt, all clay, all mire, we are nothing as to our bodyes, but a little living duſt and breathing clay, why then ſhould we be lifted up in high thoughts of our ſelves? I might hence alſo give a third note; 'Tis a common Theame, but of important uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <q>Man is a very fraile creature, he is clay.</q>
                  <p>But having had occaſion to ſpeak to this alſo heretofore, I ſhall not ſtay upon it. Only conſider, that, as man is clay, ſo he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to clay, yea turning into clay. We are but a little well compacted and compounded duſt, and we ſhall ere long crumble into duſt. We are every day going back, and ſhall ſhortly be gone back to what at firſt we were. Theſe conſiderations ſhould wither and nip the buddings of ſelfe-confidence, and bring down the height of mans ſpirit; <hi>I alſo am formed out of the clay.</hi>

                  <p>We may take notice of one thing farther, <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaking here of his own naturall formation, gives it in this ſtile; <hi>I alſo am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out of the clay.</hi> This is a peculiar Scripture-expreſſion, or the proper phraſe of the holy Ghoſt, not of a heathen Author, Poet, or Orator. They at beſt had only ſome rude notions about this myſtery of mans originall, His formation by the power of God out of the earth.

There is a terribleneſſe of man to man. Thus the holy Prophet (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 25.2.) ſaith, <hi>The blaſt of the terrible one is like a ſtorme againſt the wall.</hi> Yea, ſome men are not only dreadfull, like ſavage beaſts, but like devills, they even act or play the devill with their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. How farre have they departed from their duty, and broken all the lawes of love, which command us to be as God one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in kindneſs, in mercy and compaſſion? I grant, Magiſtrates by their place and office are ſaid to be terrible, <hi>yea a terror,</hi> but it is <hi>to evill doers</hi> (Rom: 13.3.) <hi>Rulers are not a terror to good workes, but to the evill;</hi> that is, not to thoſe whoſe workes are good, but to evill workers.

Againe, Goſpel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in ſome caſes are to be terrible, they may be <hi>Boanergeſſes,</hi> ſons of thunder to the obſtinate and rebellious, to the proud and preſumptuous ſinner; they muſt cut him out a portion to his condition, and <hi>ſave him</hi> (if it may be) <hi>with feare.</hi> But the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall temper and carriage of the Miniſters of the Goſpel is meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and gentleneſſe, they ſhould be full of love and of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>inſtructing even thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, if God peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will give them repentance, to the acknowledging of the truth.</hi> (2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 2.25, 26.)

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:104248:105"/> for his mouth craveth it of him,</hi> that's our reading; and we put in the Margent, <hi>and his mouth boweth unto him.</hi> The mouth of a labouring man boweth to him, as begging that he would get and give it ſomething to eate, and ſatisfie the craving of his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry ſtomacke. 'Tis ſad to ſee ſome poore men ſo given to Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that they had rather ſtarve then worke, and when (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the propriety of this text in the <hi>Proverbs) their mouth boweth</hi> to them, that they would take paines to get a little bread to eate, they had rather endure the burthen of hunger, then the burthen of labour; But I inſtance this place only for that word which ſignifies a <hi>burthen,</hi> or to burthen. Thoſe dreadfull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies which mere publiſhed againſt any people in Scripture, are called <hi>Burthens.

                     <hi>My Eloquence ſhall not be heavie upon thee;</hi> that's farre from the text; yet there is a truth in the thing; As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid, Though I am about to ſpeake, and have much to ſpeake, yet I would not ſpeak ſuch words, nor ſo many (I hope) as ſhall be burthenſome to thee. I would not burthen thee with Eloquence; that is, either with affected Eloquence, or the over-flowings of Eloquence. Multiplicity of expreſſion is very burthenſome; nor is any thing in ſpeech more grievous to a wiſe man, then an unneceſſary heape of words. They who have a fluency of ſpeech, are uſually more pleaſed to heare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſpeak, then others are to heare them. <hi>Elihu</hi> (according to this reading) ſpake diſcreetly, and to the purpoſe, while he thus engageth to <hi>Job; I will not burthen thee with my Eloquence.</hi> But I paſſe that alſo.</p>

                     <hi>My hand ſhall not be heavie upon thee.</hi> The hand is taken two wayes; properly, and improperly; it is not to be taken properly here; we cannot ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect <hi>Elihu</hi> of any ſuch rude behaviour, that he would lay a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hand on <hi>Job.</hi> Improperly the hand ſignifies any act of a man towards man; ſo a mans words may be his hand; A mans hand may be heavie on him, whom he never touched or came neere, yea, a mans hand may be heavie upon him whom he never ſaw.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:104248:106"/> Our hand is heavie upon others, not only by outward violence upon the body, but by any preſſure upon the mind or inward man; our vexing or troubling another, whether by doing or ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which afflicts him, is the laying of a heavie hand upon him. That's the meaning of <hi>Elihu; My hand ſhall not be heavie upon thee;</hi> that is, I will doe nothing, nor will I ſay any thing, which (in it ſelfe) ſhall be grievous and vexatious to thee. We finde <hi>David</hi> complaining (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 32.4.) that <hi>the hand of God was heavie upon him day and night;</hi> that is, God appeared as diſpleaſed with him, he could not get evidence of his love in the pardon of his ſin; This preſſed his ſoule like an intollerable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. Great afflictions of any kinde are a heavie hand upon us. <hi>Elihu</hi> who ſaw the heavie hand of God upon <hi>Job</hi> already, giveth him this comfortable promiſe, That he would not adde griefe to his ſorrow; <hi>My hand ſhall not be heavie upon thee;</hi> I know thou haſt thy load already. Theſe latter words are of the ſame gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall importance with the former; And we may Note further from them.</p>
                  <q>Meekneſs and gentle dealing becomes us while we would reduce others from their error, or reprove them for it. My hand ſhall not be heavie upon thee.</q>
                  <p>The Apoſtle called God to record concerning the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (2 Cor: 1.23, 24.) that it was to ſpare them that he had not come as then to <hi>Corinth.</hi> As if he had ſayd, I was loth to lay ſo heavie a hand upon you, or deale with ſuch ſeverity, as your caſe required. And yet he adds, what ſeverity ſoever I or others ſhall uſe towards you, we ſhall uſe it, <hi>Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but as helpers of your Joy.</hi> We ſhall not come with Lordly power upon you, we purpoſe not to carry it by meere authority and command, but of entreaty and love; we will not Lord it over your conſciences, but only regulate them, that your comforts may flow in more freely. Hard words are oftentimes more preſſing then the hardeſt blowes. Words may weigh much more upon the ſpirit, then a heavie burthen upon the backe. I grant a heavie hand muſt be layd upon ſome, there is no other way to deale with them. The word is a hammer and a fire. But as I intimated before, we muſt diſtinguiſh of perſons and of cauſes, and accordingly lay our hand. God hath not made his
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:104248:106"/> Miniſters Lyons to ſcare his flock, nor Bulls to gore them, but Shepheards to feed them and watch over them. And eſpecially when the hand of God is upon any, our hand ſhould not.</p>
                  <p>For concluſion, take here the laws of a juſt diſputation. <hi>Elihu</hi> in this Preface (I have yet gone no farther) gives <hi>Job</hi> free leave to anſwer, and ſet himſelfe to the battaile with him, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to deale with him in the faireſt and in the meeteſt way he could wiſh or deſire. It is the obſervation of a moderne Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon this place, conſidering the equanimity and gentleneſſe with which <hi>Elihu</hi> engaged himſelfe to mannage this diſpute. <hi>If ſuch a ſpirit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>could be found as here Elihu profeſſeth in this controverſie with Job,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Levaterus.</note> 
                     <hi>how ſoone might all our controverſies be ended; but we ſee moſt men every where magiſterially impoſing one upon another, yea magiſtratically. If they cannot impoſe mage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterially, and make others believe what they ſay, becauſe they ſay it, then they will impoſe magiſtratically, the Magiſtrates ſword ſhall make way, if ſtrength of argument cannot. And</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when they have diſputed a while and anſwer is made, they will not receive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but tell of priſons, of ſword and fire.</hi> Thus he taxed the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Magiſtrates of thoſe times, who layed indeed a moſt heavie hand upon all who ſubmitted not to the Babyloniſh yoke. And it were well if there were not ſomething of ſuch a ſpirit, a bitter ſpirit, an impoſing ſpirit, a ſpirit of dominion over the faith of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers remaining at this day; but that we could with ſweetneſs and gentleneſs treat about our differencies, and ſay as this man did (though a man full of zeale for truth) to our diſſenters, we will not terrifie you with the Magiſtrates ſword, nor will we deale by ſubtleneſs; we will not perſwade you by bonds and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; <hi>Our terror ſhall not make you afraid, nor our hand be heavie upon you, neither will we provoke other hands to be heavie on you;</hi> we will carry all things fairely, amicably, Chriſtianly, waiting in the uſe of proper meanes, counſels, convictions, and prayers, till God ſhall make way into every mans ſpirit to receive the truth.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre <hi>Elihu</hi> hath (like a ſubtle Orator) prefac'd it with <hi>Job,</hi> to prepare him for an attentive hearing,<note place="margin">Hactenus exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium ſequitur propoſitio.</note> for a candid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of, and a ready condiſcention to what he had ready to propoſe, and ſay.</p>

As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſayd; <hi>O Job, while I conſider thy preſent ſuffering condition, I deny not that thy affliction is great, and thy croſſe heavie; I deny not that thy afflictions are many, and of long continuance; I deny not that in the debate held with thy friends, thou haſt ſpoken many things well, and haſt inſisted upon very profitable and remarkable truths: nevertheleſſe, I cannot diſſemble my diſlike of ſome things thou haſt ſpoken, and muſt tell thee plainly wherein either through paſſion, or want of information, thou haſt been much miſtaken. And yet thou ſhalt ſee that I will not impoſe my ſenſe upon thy words, nor ſtrain nor torture them by undue and odious inferences to thy diſadvantage; But ſhall recollect and fairly repreſent ſome paſſages which have fallen from thee, and ſhew thee the error of them. I know thou canſt not deny that thou haſt ſayd the things which I am offended with; and I believe when thou haſt heard me a while, and conſidered better of them, thou wilt not undertake to defend them. Surely thou haſt ſpoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voyce of thy words, ſaying, I am cleane,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In that <hi>Elihu</hi> coming to charge <hi>Job</hi> about what he had ſpoken, profeſſeth he had been a ſerious hearer of him, while he was ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>What we object againſt others, we ſhould have good evidence and proofe of it our ſelves.</q>
                  <p>There are two infallible witneſſes, or they may be ſo; Firſt, eye-witneſſes, ſuch as have ſeene that which they ſay; the witneſs of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:104248:108"/> the eye is ſureſt as to what is done. Secondly, Eare-witneſſes, and they are the ſureſt as to what is ſpoken. We ſhould not take up ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations by <hi>heare-ſay, but be able to ſay, we have heard the accuſed ſay it.</hi> Thus ſaid <hi>Elihu,</hi> I have not taken up this matter by the way, from thoſe I met with, But I have been upon the place my ſelfe; I ſtood by thee and heard while theſe words dropped from thy mouth. Many report what they never heard, they report up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on report; as thoſe accuſers in the Prophet, (<hi>Jer:</hi> 20.10.) <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port (ſay they) and we will report it.</hi> They cannot ſay, as <hi>Elihu,</hi> You have ſpoken it in our hearing, and we have heard the voyce of your words, but we heare you have ſpoken it; or you are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for ſpeaking it. How many tranſgreſs the rules of charity, and break the bonds not only of civill friendſhip, but of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an love, upon reports of what others report. 'Tis dangerous to report more of others, then we have heard them ſay, till (at leaſt) we are ſure the reporters heard them ſay it.</p>
                  <p>Againe, When <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt ſpoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voyce of thy words;</hi> He would convince <hi>Job</hi> to the utmoſt.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>To accuſe or condemne any man out of his owne mouth, must needs ſtop his mouth. <hi>Or,</hi> To be condemned out of our owne mouth, is an unanſwerable condemnation.</q>
                  <p>When our owne ſayings are brought againſt us, what have we to ſay? Chriſt told the evill and unprofitable ſervant, who would needs put in a plea for his idleneſs, and excuſe himſelfe for hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Lords talent in a napkin (that is, for not uſing or improving his gift) (<hi>Luk:</hi> 19.22.) <hi>Out of thine owne mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked ſervant;</hi> I will goe no further then thy owne words. And we ſee, as that evill ſervant had done nothing before, ſo then he could ſay nothing, becauſe judged out of his owne mouth. When the offenders tongue condemneth him, who can acquit him? (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 64.8.) <hi>So they ſhall make their owne tongue to fall upon themſelves.</hi> The tongues of ſome men have fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and cruſht them like a mountaine, and they have been preſſed downe, yea irrecoverably oppreſſed with the weight of their owne words. The Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> tells us what the Lord will do when he comes to Judgement, in that great and ſolemne day of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:104248:108"/> his ſecond Appearing, (<hi>v:</hi> 15.) <hi>He ſhall convince all that are ungodly, of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and of all their hard ſpeeches, which ungodly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him.</hi> He ſhall ſay to them, are not theſe your words? can you deny them? or have you any plea for them? Have you not ſpoken theſe things in my hearing? And have I not heard the voyce of your words, ſpeaking thus and thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully of my wayes, ordinances, and ſervants? This is like wounding a man with his own weapon, 'tis like the act of <hi>David</hi> in cutting off the head of <hi>Goliah</hi> with his owne ſword. He that is condemned by his owne ſaying, dyeth by his own ſword. <hi>David</hi> ſaith of ſychophants and ſlanderers (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 55.21.) <hi>Their words were ſmoother then oyle, yet were they drawne ſwords.</hi> Such draw theſe ſwords with an intent to wound other mens reputation or good name, but they ofteneſt wound their owne; And as their words who ſlander others, rebound upon themſelves, and turne to their owne diſgrace, ſo alſo doe theirs for the moſt part, who are much in commending or poſſibly only (which was <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe) in vindicating themſelves. <hi>Surely thou haſt ſpoken in my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But what had <hi>Elihu</hi> heard <hi>Job</hi> ſpeake? the next words are an anſwer, or declare the matter of his ſpeech; and in them, as was ſaid before in opening the Context; <hi>Elihu</hi> firſt chargeth him with an over-zeale in juſtifying himſelfe, <hi>I have heard the voyce of thy words, ſaying;</hi>

                  <p>This thou haſt ſayd, and this I charge upon thee as a great ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. For the clearing of theſe words, I ſhall doe theſe foure things, becauſe upon this charge the whole diſcourſe of <hi>Elihu</hi> throughout the Chapter depends.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſhall give the ſence and explication of the words as here expreſſed by <hi>Elihu,</hi> and ſome briefe notes from them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſhall ſhew what matter of accuſation, or of fault there is in theſe words of <hi>Job,</hi> as brought by <hi>Elihu</hi> in charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, or how ſinfull a thing it is for any man to ſay he is without ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I ſhall enquire what ground <hi>Job</hi> had given <hi>Elihu</hi> to charge him with ſaying theſe things.</p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:104248:109"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, (which followeth upon the third) I ſhall inquire whether <hi>Elihu</hi> dealt rightly and fairely with <hi>Job,</hi> in bringing thi ſore and ſevere charge againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To open the words, as they are an aſſertion, Thou haſt ſayd, <hi>I am cleane without tranſgreſſion, I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me.</hi> Some diſtinguiſh the three terms uſed in the text, as a deniall of three ſeverall ſorts of ſin. Firſt, That, by <hi>being cleane without tranſgreſſion,</hi> he intends his freedome from ſins againſt ſobriety, or that he had not ſinn'd againſt himſelfe. Secondly, that, <hi>by being innocent,</hi> his meaning is, he had not done impiouſly againſt God. Thirdly, that, by <hi>having no iniquity in him,</hi> he cleares himſelfe of wrong done to man. Theſe three ſorts of ſin, containe ſin in the whole latitude of it. All ſin is either againſt our ſelves, ſtrictly called intemperance, or againſt God, ſtrictly called impiety, or againſt man, ſtrictly called unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. But though this hath a truth in it, as to the diſtinction of ſins, yet it may be over-nice to conclude <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct reſpect in theſe diſtinct expreſſions; And it may be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned whether the words will beare it quite thorow. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I paſſe from it and leave it to the readers Judgement.</p>
                  <p>Further as to the verſe in generall, we may take notice, that the ſame thing is ſayd foure times; twice affirmatively, <hi>I am cleane, I am innocent;</hi> And twice negatively, <hi>I am without tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, There is no iniquity in me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>I am cleane without tranſgreſſion.</q>
                  <p>The word which we render <hi>cleane,</hi> implyeth the cleaneſt of cleanneſſe; 'tis rightly oppoſed to the word <hi>tranſgreſſion,</hi> which ſignifieth, a defection or turning off from God. Every ſin in the nature of it, is a defection from God; but ſome ſins are an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or reſolved defection from him. Some even throw off the ſoveraignty of God over them, and his power to command them, not being willing to ſubmit their backs to his burden, nor their necks to his yoke. Theſe are juſtly called <hi>ſons of Belial,</hi> they not only tranſgreſſe the Law, but throw off the yoke of Chriſt from their necks, and his burden from their ſhoulderS, and ſay (like them, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.14.) <hi>We will not have this man reigne over us.</hi> So then, when <hi>Job</hi> ſayd, <hi>I am cleane without tranſgreſſion,</hi> he may be very well underſtood thus; <hi>Though I have many failings, yet
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:104248:109"/> I am free from defection, though I have many weakneſſes, yet I am free from rebellion and obſtinacy. I ſtill retaine an entire love to God, and am ready to ſubmit to his will, though I often find my heart, through corruption, riſing up against my duty; I am tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned aſide through the ſtrength of temptations, but I turne not aſide through the bent of my affections.</hi> This doubtleſſe or ſomewhat like this was <hi>Job's</hi> ſence when ever he ſayd, <hi>I am cleane without tranſgreſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Tranſgreſſion is a pollution, <hi>or,</hi> Sin is a defilement.</q>
                  <p>If once men ſtep over or beſides the line and rule of holineſſe the Law of God (which to doe is tranſgreſſion) they become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy. <hi>Job</hi> ſuppoſed himſelfe uncleane, if guilty of tranſgreſſion. Sin is an uncleane thing, and it maketh man uncleane. This the Church confeſſed (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 64.6.) <hi>We all are as an unclean thing,</hi> or perſon; As if they had ſaid, Time was, when there was a choice people among us, who kept themſelves pure from common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements; But now the contagion and corruption is ſo epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and univerſal, that the whole body of our people lookes like a lump of filthineſſe and uncleanneſſe. We are over-ſpread with a loathſome Leproſie from head to foote, from top to toe. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe keeps us faire, and righteouſneſſe ſweet.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>A ſinleſſe perſon is a cleane perſon.</q>
                  <p>When we arrive at perfect freedome from ſin, we ſhall be cleane indeed, perfectly cleane. And according to the degree or proportion of our freedome from ſin in this world, is our clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in this uncleane world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thou haſt ſaid, <hi>I am innocent;</hi> ſo we read; There are two ſignifications given by the learned, which are of very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conſideration for the clearing up of this text. Firſt,<note place="margin">

                     </note> the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word which we tranſlate <hi>innocent,</hi> is derived from a roote which ſignifieth to hide, to cover, or protect; And that two wayes; Firſt, to protect actively, or to defend others; Secondly, It notes protection paſſively, or to be protected by another. Some conceive that <hi>Elihu</hi> here intended it of <hi>Job</hi> in an active ſignification, whereas we ſay, <hi>I am innocent,</hi> they ſay, <hi>I protect,</hi>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:104248:110"/> and ſo referre to him, as a Magiſtrate I have protected the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, I have protected thoſe whom the ſons of violence have proſecuted. Indeed <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks his practice much in that (<hi>Chap:</hi> 29. 12.) <hi>I delivered the poore that cryed, and the fatherleſs, and him that had none to helpe him; The bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh came upon me, and I cauſed the widdows heart to ſing for joy. Job</hi> had been a <hi>great Protector</hi> of the poore; And by this word the Hebrews expreſſe an haven or harbour for Ships; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe harbours or havens are places of protection to Ships; Firſt, they are places of protection to Ships from winds and ſtorms, they are ſafe places from rocks, ſhelfs and ſands; a Ship in harbour is under protection from the dangers of the Sea. Secondly, A Ship in harbour is under protection from enemies and Pirats; while ſhee is abroad at Sea, if enemies come ſhee muſt ſhift for her ſelfe, ſhee muſt run or fight, but in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſhe is under the protection of the State or Country where ſhe arriveth. Thus all Magiſtrates are or ſhould be, a juſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is a good harbour for all that are in danger of the winds and ſtormes, of the rocks and rage of wicked men. Good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours are an harbour, and oppreſſors like ſtorms and rocks. That's one ſence of the word in the active ſignification. And ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it in this ſence <hi>Job</hi> aſſerts highly for his owne honour, while he ſaith, I have been a protectour of the oppreſſed, I have been a harbour or a haven to the weather-beaten poore.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others take this protection paſſively, <hi>I have been protected. Job</hi> was once protected from all outward evill, from the invaſion of devills and evill men. God made ſuch an hedge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, that Satan could not touch him. But the ſence given of this protection here intended is ſpirituall, <hi>I have been protected from the evill of the world, or from the evill world, I have been kept from that pollution and corruption, which</hi> (as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>is in the world through luſt.</hi> And that is a bleſſed, yea the beſt part of a Saints protection, <hi>he is kept through the power of God through faith unto ſalvation;</hi> He is not given up to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements and apoſtacy of times or places, the Lord preſerves his ſpirit and his wayes pure and cleane. Our tranſlation, <hi>I am inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> compared with this, <hi>I have been kept or protected from ſin.</hi> The one is a very good expoſition and illuſtration of the other; <hi>For innocency is our ſafety, and integrity our beſt keeper. Innocency
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:104248:110"/> is our faire haven, and ſafeſt harbour.</hi> When the windes are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and the Seas moſt rough and angry, there; if any where, we may ſhelter and anchor our ſelves from the ſtorme and tempeſt. Thus <hi>David</hi> prayed (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 25.21.) <hi>Let integrity and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs preſerve me;</hi> that is, let me be preſerved in mine integrity and uprightneſs. And that he had been ſo preſerved, he tells us (<hi>Pſ:</hi> 41.12.) <hi>As for me thou upholdeſt me in mine integrity.</hi> He that can ſay, <hi>I am innocent,</hi> ſhall have cauſe to ſay, <hi>I am protected;</hi> the innocent perſon is under covert; God protecteth the innocent, yea maketh innocency their protection. Man is never ſo well ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, as by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and by his own innocency. 'Tis guilt which leaves our breaſt naked to every dart and thruſt.</p>
                  <p>Againe to come a little nearer to our tranſlation (though this be very ſignificant) <hi>I am innocent;</hi> 'Tis a negative, I have done no hurt, or I have no guilt upon me. The Rabbins tell us,<note place="margin">

I have no filth in my skirts, nor fouleneſſe in my hands. I goe not in the naſty habit of ſin, but in the lovely, comely, beautifull dreſſe of Grace. Thus various is the ſence of the word which we tranſlate <hi>innocent. Job's</hi> converſation was ſo well ordered, that it had not a plight nor an haire (common infirmities ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) amiſſe or out of order. Our tranſlation gives in his mind fully, yet it is not unprofitable to take in this plenty and copiouſneſs of elegant metaphors riſing out of the original words, here rendred, <hi>I am innocent.</hi> But if we take the word ſtrictly, then to be innocent, is to doe or to have done no hurt, to be harmeleſſe, and ſo guiltleſſe of the hurt or harme of any.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>Sin is an hurtfull thing.</q>
                  <p>It hurts, firſt our ſelves; Secondly, it hurts others in whoſe ſight it is committed, either firſt by the ill example given them, or, ſecondly, by injury done to them; either firſt in their credit, or, ſecondly, in their eſtates. Yea, thirdly, ſin hurts God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:104248:111"/> It hurts God in his honour. Innocency is properly that which doth no hurt; Innocent perſons are harmeleſſe perſons; no man ever hurt himſelfe, or others, much leſſe the name and honour of God, while he holdeth his innocency.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job's</hi> laſt aſſertion is;
<q>Neither is there iniquity in me.</q>

                        </gap>, pravitas eſt rectitudini oppoſita.</note>Iniquity is that pravity either of ſpirit or action which is contrary to all that righteouſneſs or rectitude which the rule of Gods word requireth. It comprehends both the irregularity of our actions, and the irregularity of our thoughts or conceptions. 'Tis a departure from the way in which, and from the ſcope and mark, to which we ſhould direct our whole courſe. Iniquity is an unequall an undue or crooked thing. It turneth others from their right, and is it ſelfe a continuall ſwerving from it. So much for the opening of theſe words, as they are a propoſition contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a charge brought againſt <hi>Job, I have heard the voyce of thy words, ſaying, I am cleane from tranſgreſſion, I am innocent, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there iniquity in me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond poynt propoſed was, to conſider what matter of accuſation there is in theſe words. Matters of accuſation ariſe from our evill deeds; <hi>That we are not cleane from tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we are not innocent, that there is much iniquity in us;</hi> theſe are properly matter of accuſation. But here <hi>Elihu</hi> makes it matter of accuſation, that <hi>Job</hi> ſayd, he was cleane from tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, that he was innocent, that there was no iniquity in him. And indeed, to be charged with the greateſt tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is not more then this, to be charged with ſaying, we are cleane from tranſgreſſion. To ſay we have no ſin, is very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to ſay we are without iniquity, is a ſaying full of iniquity, (1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8.) <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin</hi> (Here is <hi>Job</hi> ſaying ſo, as <hi>Elihu</hi> chargeth him) <hi>we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> And (<hi>v:</hi> 10.) <hi>If any man ſay, he hath no ſin, he maketh God a lyar, and his word is not in him.</hi> Now what greater ſin can there be, if we conſider the force of theſe two verſes, then for any man to ſay he hath no ſin? How extreamly ſinfull this is, may be ſhewed in foure things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is extreame pride for any man to ſay; <hi>I have no ſin;</hi> What is pride? but an over-reckoning of our ſelves. When we
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:104248:111"/> value our ſelves, 'tis beſt to doe it at an under rate, and to ſay leſſe of our ſelves (if it may be) then we are, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, who called himſelfe <hi>leſſe then the leaſt of all Saints;</hi> Pride alwayes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-reckons and caſts us up more then we are worth. Some rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon their temporall and many more their ſpirituall eſtates at many thouſands (as I may ſay) when upon a true account they are worſe then nothing. So did the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> (Rev: 3.17.) <hi>Thou ſayeſt I am rich, and encreaſed with goods, and have need of nothing, and knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poore, and blind, and naked.</hi> They who are ſoule-blind, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee either how bad they are, or what good they want; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinders the ſight of our wants ſo much as a conceit that we are full.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is the greateſt deceit, even ſelfe-deceit, to ſay or ſuppoſe that we are (in this ſence) <hi>cleane without tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> ſo ſaith that text of the Apoſtle (<hi>v:</hi> 8.) <hi>He that ſaith he hath no ſin, deceiveth himſelfe.</hi> It is bad enough to deceive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and woe to them that doe ſo; but how bad is their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who deceive themſelves! He is in an ill condition who is deceived by others; But if a man deceive himſelfe, where ſhall he have his amends? Selfe-admirers, and ſelfe-flatterers, are the Greateſt ſelfe-deceivers. And who or what ſhall be true to that man, who is falſe to himſelfe?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is a lye and the greateſt lye, (that's more then a bare deceit) for it is ſuch a lye as leaveth no truth at all in us. He that ſaith he hath no ſin in him, hath no truth in him; what hath he in him then, but a lye? Every ſin is a lye, and he that ſaith he hath no ſin in him, hath nothing of truth in him; what hath he then in him, or what is he, but a lye? (<hi>v:</hi> 10.) <hi>The word of God is not in him,</hi> which is the treaſury of all truth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath no truth in him, nor can have, till he hath repented of that lye.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, (that ye may ſee there is exceeding much in this charge) <hi>To ſay ſo, is blaſphemy, and the higheſt blaſphemy;</hi> Why? Becauſe it makes God a lyar, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e that ſaith he hath no ſin, doth not only deceive himſelfe, but as much as in him lyeth, he makes God a lyar (<hi>v:</hi> 10.) To deceive with a lye, is the worſt ſort of deceivings; and what lye is worſe then, or ſo bad as that which makes the God of truth a lyar, and turnes the truth of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:104248:112"/> God into a lye. Lay theſe foure conſiderations together, and then it will appeare how heavie a charge is contained in theſe words, when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith he had heard <hi>Job</hi> ſay, <hi>he was cleane with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tranſgreſſion, he was innocent, and no iniquity in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, thirdly, conſider a little further, what occaſion had <hi>Job</hi> given <hi>Elihu</hi> to ſay that he had ſayd, <hi>I am cleane from tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, There are ſeverall paſſages upon which <hi>Elihu</hi> might pitch this charge; I will only name foure texts, out of which, poſſibly this might ariſe. Firſt, (<hi>Chap:</hi> 10. 7.) where <hi>Job</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God himſelfe ſaith; <hi>Thou knoweſt that I am not wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> He appealed to the knowledge of God himſelfe in the thing. The ſecond may be collected from (<hi>Chap:</hi> 16. 17.) <hi>Not for any injuſtice in my hand, alſo my prayer is pure.</hi> The third, from (<hi>Chap:</hi> 23. 10.) <hi>But he knoweth the way that I take, when he hath tryed me I ſhall come forth as gold; My foot hath held his ſteps, his way have I kept and not declined.</hi> In the fourth place <hi>Elihu</hi> might take thoſe words (<hi>Chap:</hi> 27. 5.) <hi>God forbid that I ſhould juſtifie you, till I die I will not remove my integrity from me. My righteouſneſs I hold faſt, and will not let it goe, my heart ſhall not reproach me as long as I live.</hi> All theſe are <hi>Job's</hi> aſſertions concerning his owne innocency, And theſe or ſuch like paſſages as theſe, <hi>Elihu</hi> ('tis likely) being an attentive hearer, had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and picked up as the matter of this firſt part of his charge, <hi>Job's ſelf-juſtification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, let us conſider whether <hi>Elihu</hi> did right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring this charge againſt <hi>Job</hi> from theſe ſayings? or whether he dealt ſo ingenuouſly with <hi>Job</hi> as he promiſed, while from theſe or the like paſſages he ſaith, <hi>Job</hi> had ſayd, <hi>I am cleane with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tranſgreſſion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For anſwer, firſt, take notice that <hi>Elihu</hi> was not the firſt that had charged <hi>Job</hi> thus; he had been thus charged by his three friends before. <hi>Zophar</hi> ſayd (<hi>Chap:</hi> 11. 4.) <hi>Thou hast ſayd my doctrine is pure, and I am cleane in thine eyes;</hi> that is, in the eyes of God. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſeem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s to ſay as much (<hi>Chap:</hi> 15. 14.) <hi>What is man that he ſhould be clean? and he which is borne of a woman that he ſhould be righteous?</hi> While <hi>Eliphaz</hi> put theſe queſtions, he intimated that <hi>Job</hi> had made ſuch affirmations. <hi>Bildad</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was upon the ſame ſtrain with him (<hi>Chap:</hi> 25. 4.) <hi>How
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:104248:112"/> then can man be juſtified with God? or how can he be cleane that is borne of a woman?</hi> We ſee then, this was not the firſt time by three, that <hi>Job</hi> had heard this charge, and had made anſwer for himſelfe. And as theſe charges, ſo <hi>Job's</hi> anſwers have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened heretofore upon thoſe former paſſages, and therefore I ſhall not ſtay much upon the poynt here. Yet becauſe <hi>Elihu</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumes this argument, yea makes it his ſtrongeſt argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Job,</hi> I ſhall a little conſider whether he did rightly or no in this thing.</p>
                  <p>To cleare (which we muſt remember) that <hi>Job's</hi> innocency had received a three-fold teſtimony in this booke.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He received a teſtimony from God himſelfe, and that a very notable and glorious one (<hi>Chap:</hi> 1. 8.) <hi>Haſt thou conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my ſervant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, He received a further teſtimony from the pen-man of this book, who having recorded the ſeverall afflictions of <hi>Job,</hi> and his behaviour under them, repeats it twice (<hi>Chap:</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Chap:</hi> 2. 10.) <hi>In all this Job ſinned not, nor charged God fooliſhly.</hi> The teſtimony which God gave him, referred to his former actions or converſation before his affliction. The teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which the writer gave him, referred ſpecially to his latter words or ſpeeches under his affliction. Beſides theſe teſtimonies which are not at all queſtioned nor can be; we find a third te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, and that he gives of himſelfe. Now though <hi>Elihu</hi> did highly reverence the teſtimony which God had given (if we may ſuppoſe he had notice of it) and would alſo the teſtimony of the pen-man of the booke, had it then been written; yet he que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned the teſtimony which <hi>Job</hi> gave of himſelfe. Now, that there was ſome ſeverity in this charge upon that ſuſpition, may appeare by conſidering it in a few particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It muſt be ſayd on <hi>Job's</hi> part, or in favour of him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth, that he never affirmed, he was not a ſinner. Nay we ſhall find him more then once, twice, or thrice, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſinfulneſs of his nature, and the ſins of his life. We find him alſo confeſſing that notwithſtanding all the righteouſneſs and integrity in him, yet he would owne none of it before God; and that if he ſhould juſtifie himſelfe, his owne cloaths would ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre him. Therefore <hi>Job</hi> was far from ſaying he had no ſin in him, in a ſtrict ſence.</p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:104248:113"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Moſt of thoſe paſſages wherein he ſpeakes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as cleane and righteous, may be underſtood of his imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive cleanneſs and righteouſneſs, as a perſon juſtified in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, of whom he ſpake with ſuch a Goſpel ſpirit and full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith, that he might well aſſert this of himſelfe, <hi>I know that being juſtified, I am cleane and without ſin.</hi> It is no fault for a believer to ſay, <hi>I am cleane without tranſgreſſion, through free Grace, in the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Much of what <hi>Job</hi> ſpake in this matter is to be taken that way.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When <hi>Job</hi> affirmes theſe things of himſelfe, we may ſay this in favour of him, he meanes it of great tranſgreſſions. The words in the text note defection and wilfull ſwerving from the right way. His friends charged him with hypocriſie, with oppreſſion, with taking the pledge for nought, with ſtripping the naked of their clothing. <hi>Thine iniquity is great</hi> (ſaid <hi>Eliphaz) and thy ſin is infinite.</hi> Now ſaith <hi>Job, I am cleane,</hi> I have no ſuch tranſgreſſions. And he might well anſwer his friends charge of impiety againſt God, and iniquity towards men, with a flat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, yea with an affirmation of the contrary; There is no ſuch iniquity in me, prove it if you can. He was unblameable in the ſight of man.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In favour of <hi>Job</hi> this may be ſayd; what he ſpake of himſelfe and of his owne righteouſneſs, was upon much provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, of when his ſpirit was heated by his friends, who ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly urged theſe crimes againſt him. In theſe heats he ſpake highly of himſelfe, and though it doth not excuſe any mans ſin when he hath ſpoken ſinfully, to ſay I was provoked; yet it doth abate the greatneſs of the ſin. Good <hi>Moſes</hi> (who was the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man upon the earth) when through provocation he ſpake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly with his lips, felt the ſmart of it, and God reckoned ſorely with him for it: Yet to ſpeake amiſſe upon provocation, is not ſo much amiſſe, as to ſpeake ſo in cold blood, or unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Elihu</hi> might have put a fairer interpretation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon theſe ſayings of <hi>Job;</hi> He might have taken them in the beſt ſence, as <hi>Job</hi> meant them, that he was righteous, cleane and innocent in all his tranſactions with men, and had not wickedly at any time departed from God. And then ther had not been ſuch matter of fault in what he ſaid, as was broughe againſt him.</p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:104248:113"/>
                  <p>Yet, in vindication of <hi>Elihu,</hi> it muſt be granted, <hi>Job</hi> gave him occaſion to rebuke and blame what he had ſaid, and that chiefly upon theſe three accounts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe he ſpake many things of himſelfe which had an appearance of boaſting, and ſo of vaine ſpeaking. A little tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſayd of our ſelves, or in our owne commendation, may be thought too much, how much more, when we ſay much.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He ſpake ſuch things as carri'd a ſhew of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldneſs with God. He did not obſerve his diſtance, as he ought, when he ſo earneſtly preſſed for a hearing to plead his cauſe before God; eſpecially, when he ſo often complained of the ſeverity of Gods proceedure with him, with which <hi>Elihu</hi> taxeth him directly in the two verſes following. Upon both theſe grounds <hi>Elihu</hi> thought (and was no doubt guided in it by the Spirit of God) to cut him to the quick, that <hi>Job</hi> might learne to ſpeake more humbly of himſelfe, and more temperately to God. And therefore</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Lord did righteouſly, yea and graciouſly let out the ſpirit of <hi>Elihu</hi> upon him in another way then his friends before had done. He did not charge him with wickedneſs in fact, but dealt with him about the unwarineſs of his words. <hi>Job</hi> could not ſay he had never ſpoken ſuch words, for ſuch words he did ſpeake, though he did not ſpeake them as <hi>Elihu</hi> tooke them. When words are out they muſt ſtand to the mercy of the hearers, and abide ſuch a judgement as may, with truth be made of them, though poſſibly, beſides the purpoſe of the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. A man (in that caſe) is not wronged, he ſhould learne to ſpeak more warily, and not give occaſion of offence. Doubtleſſe the Lord had a gracious intent upon <hi>Job,</hi> in ſtirring the ſpirit of <hi>Elihu</hi> to repreſent his words in the hardeſt ſence, that he might humble him. <hi>Job's</hi> ſpirit was yet too high and not broken e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, as it was afterwards. Nor doth <hi>Job</hi> reply or retort up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Elihu</hi> for this; And when the Lord himſelfe began to deal with him, he ſaith, <hi>Who is this that darkeneth councell by words without knowledge</hi> (Chap: 38. 2.) and <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe being brought upon his knees confeſſeth (<hi>Chap:</hi> 42. 3.) <hi>I have uttered that I underſtood not, things too wonderfull for me, which I knew not:</hi> I have been too bold I confeſſe. Though it was not <hi>Jobs</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or meaning to ſpeake ſo (he had integrity in what he ſpake)
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:104248:114"/> yet his words did beare ſuch a conſtruction. And the Lord ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd <hi>Elihu</hi> to urge them upon him to the utmoſt.</p>
                  <p>Yet, notwithſtanding all that hath been ſayd, I doe conceive, that <hi>Elihu</hi> had not the leaſt imagination, that the meaning of <hi>Job</hi> in thoſe aſſertions concerning himſelfe, was, that he had not ſinned at all, or that there was no ſin in him; But taking his words in the beſt and faireſt conſtruction they could beare, he yet ſaw cauſe to check and reprove him, for ſaying ſo much, in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, about his innocency; whereas he ſhould have been chiefly taken up in glorifying God, and humbling himſelfe under his mighty hand. So much for the anſwer to the fourth query, what reaſon <hi>Elihu</hi> had to charge <hi>Job</hi> thus? It hath been ſhewed wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> may be ſayd in favour of <hi>Job;</hi> And alſo, that <hi>Elihu</hi> might without breach of charity charge him with theſe ſayings.</p>
                  <p>To ſhut up this verſe, take only two briefe notes from the whole.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The best of men have their failings, and are apt to over-report themſelves.</q>
                  <p>Our moſt deliberate actions and ſpeeches have ſome tincture of the fleſh, how much more thoſe which paſſe us in a paſſion. Though <hi>Job</hi> ſpake what was true, yet he ſpake more then was meete. And they that heard him might take juſt occaſion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, not knowing his ſpirit and the ſtrain of his heart in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith (<hi>James</hi> 3. 2.) <hi>If any man of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend not in word, the ſame is a perfect man, and able alſo to bridle the whole body.</hi> He hath a mighty command over his ſpirit, that can command his tongue; eſpecially when he is provoked. It is a reall part of perfection, not to offend in word. This good man ſpake many things well, yet all was not well ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>Againe, In that <hi>Job</hi> ſpake thus, under the preſſure of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>In times of affliction it is better to be much in bewailing of ſin, then in making reports wherein we have not ſinned.</q>
                  <p>There will no hurt come of that; but while we are reporting our innocency, and good deeds, though what we ſpeak be true, yet 'tis ſubject to conſtruction, and layeth us open to reproofe.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, We may learne from the dealing of <hi>Elihu</hi> with <hi>Job,</hi>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:104248:114"/> That in all diſputations, and matters of controverſie with others, we ſhould take heed, that we faſten no uncharitable interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the words of our adverſary, nor adde any thing of our owne to them, nor wreſt them beſides their grammaticall and genuine conſtruction; yet even thoſe ſpeeches which are true in ſome reſpect, if they exceed the bounds of modeſty, may freely be reprehended. For we ought not only to doe that which is good, and ſpeake that which is true for the matter, but we ought to doe and ſpeake in a good or becoming manner. Thus farre of the firſt fault which <hi>Elihu</hi> found and reproved in <hi>Job,</hi> his over-confidence in ſaying he was not faulty, or in juſtifying himſelfe. In the two next verſes, he blames him with reflecting over-boldly and unduely upon the dealings of God; The particulars whereof were expreſſed before in opening the whole Context, and come now to be further opened.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren were very ſuſpitious of this (<hi>Gen:</hi> 43.18.) <hi>The men were afraid becauſe they were brought to Joſephs houſe, and they ſaid, becauſe of the money that was found in our ſacks mouth the firſt time, are we brought in that he may ſeek occaſion againſt us;</hi> As if they had ſaid, we well perceive he would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſome matter to accuſe us, and ſo to detaine us upon that occaſion. Thus ſaid the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (2 Kings 5.7.) when <hi>Naman</hi> came to him with a meſſage from his Prince to deſire him that he would heale him of his Leproſie; The King of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> began preſently to ſtartle, and thought it was nothing but a meere trick and a device to bring on ſome further deſigne, what? ſaid he, <hi>Am I God to kill and make alive, that this man is come to me, wherefore conſider I pray you, and ſee how he ſeeketh a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell againſt me.</hi> They may be judged to watch for a diſcourteſie who deſire courteſies of us beyond our power. This made the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> jealous, that the King of <hi>Syria</hi> being confident of future ſucceſſe, by his former ſucceſſes againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was by this device only ſeeking an occaſion to renew the warre. We have an eminent Scripture to this purpoſe (<hi>Dan:</hi> 6.4, 5.) <hi>Daniel</hi> being advanced high at Court, it drew a great deale of envie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him among the Princes and Preſidents; and therefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to try their utmoſt to pull him down; And hereupon (ſaith the text) <hi>they ſought occaſions againſt Daniel concerning the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> that is, they enquired narrowly into his proceedings as to the mannagement of that great power and truſt which the King had committed to him in civill things, but <hi>they could find no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:104248:115"/> nor fault; foraſmuch as he was faithfull.</hi> They could not pick a hole in his coate (as we ſay) neither was there any error or fault found in him. When this would not doe, then they would needs goe another way to worke (envie is reſtleſſe) and becauſe they were diſappointed in their firſt attempt about civills, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to matters of religion; <hi>Then ſaid thoſe men we ſhall not finde occaſion againſt this Daniel, except we finde it in regard of the Law of his God.</hi> And we ſee in the following parts of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what occaſion they found againſt him. This is hard deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed, and it is quite contrary to the Law of Love in all the actings of it. The Apoſtle aſſures us (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 13.7.) <hi>Love beareth all things,</hi> Love hath ſtrong ſhoulders to beare wrongs and injuries, and <hi>Love believeth all things;</hi> not that a believer is a vaine credulous perſon, giving out his faith he knows not how, or to he knows not what; but he believeth all things to the utmoſt line of truth and reality, as alſo of appearance and probability; he that loves is very willing to believe that things are meant as they are ſpoken, and that they are intended as they are done. Thus he that loves much, <hi>believes all things,</hi> and further, <hi>charity hopeth all things;</hi> it hopes the beſt, and puts the faireſt interpretation that may be upon thoſe things and doings which carry in them at leaſt ſome colour of ſuſpition; this is the Genius of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the Character of Love. <hi>It beareth all things, it believeth all things, it hopeth all things.</hi> All which ſtand in direct oppoſition to the ſeeking of occaſions againſt our neighbour. And I ſhall briefly ſhew how much ſuch practices militate againſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the royall Law of love, by ſeven ſteps.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, 'Tis againſt the Law of love, to be ready to take an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion when it is given; we ſhould be very ſlow and backward, in caſe of offence, to embrace or admit what is offered: though indeed, it is with the heart of man, I meane with the fleſh in his heart in this poynt of the Law, as it is with the fleſh (that is, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full corruption) in the heart, as to the whole Law of God; Of which the Apoſtle ſaith (<hi>Rom:</hi> 7.8.) <hi>Sin taking occaſion by the Commandement, wrought in me all manner of concupiſcence.</hi> And againe (<hi>v:</hi> 11.) <hi>Sin taking occaſion by the commandement, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me, and by it ſlew me:</hi> Sin took occaſion by the Law; The Law gave ſin no occaſion to work concupiſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce in <hi>Paul.</hi> The Law is farre enough from being the cauſe of ſin, but it is (by accident
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:104248:116"/> not of it ſelfe) the occaſion of ſin; yea, ſin preſently takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion when it hath not indeed the ſhew of any juſt occaſion. The Law by its prohibition, by the ſtop and check which it puts upon the fleſh, by the diſcoveries which it makes of the contrariety of our corruptions to the holineſs of it, doth many times provoke and irritate, yea enrage and enflame them, but it affords not the leaſt countenance or encouragement to our corruptions. Now this (I ſay) is the wickedneſs of the heart of man, with reſpect to ſin in Generall, that it takes occaſion by the commandement, to bend it ſelfe againſt the commandement: and ſo as to any particular act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a brother, to take an occaſion to doe him a miſchiefe, is wickedneſs, and a worke of the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is ſinfull to uſe our Chriſtian liberty, when it may be an occaſion of ſin, or the laying of a ſtumbling block before others, though we uſe it not with an intent or purpoſe to make them ſtumble or fall into ſin. The Apoſtle earneſtly cautions the <hi>Romans</hi> to take heed of this (<hi>Rom:</hi> 14.13.) <hi>Let us not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore judge one another any more; but judge this rather, that no man put a ſtumbling block or an occaſion to fall in his brothers way.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> is there ſpeaking about the obſervation of dayes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and the uſe of meates forbidden by the ceremoniall Law. Now though ſome had a liberty in their conſciences, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the one, and uſe the other, yet he would not have them doe either with offence to weaker brethren: our care ſhould be, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther firſt to keepe our brother from falling, or to raiſe him up when fallen. Is it not then very ſinfull not to forbeare thoſe things (which are no abſolute duties) by which another may fall? And if it be ſo ſinfull to doe many things which in themſelves are not ſinfull, when we know they may be an offence or occaſion of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to others, though we intend it not; then how extreamly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is it to do any thing with an intent to make them fall! This is properly the devills trade, and woe to thoſe who take it out of his hand, or joyne partners with him in it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When any ſhall deſire and even hunger after an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of accuſing others, this is a very great height of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The Apoſtle ſpeakes of ſuch (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 11.9, 12.) where he tells us that he did forbeare his own right, not receiving maintenance for preaching the Goſpel; <hi>When</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>v:</hi> 9.) <hi>I was preſent with you and wanted, I was chargeable to no man.</hi>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:104248:116"/> But why? he anſwers (<hi>v:</hi> 12.) <hi>What I doe I will doe, that I may cut off occaſion from them which deſire occaſion.</hi> Some did, it ſeems, deſire an occaſion to charge him with covetouſneſſe and worldly mindedneſſe, that he preached the Goſpel for filthy lucre; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith he, I will doe this, that I may cut off occaſion from them that deſire occaſion to charge me with. The heart of man is full of evill deſires, and this is one of the worſt of them, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire another might be found doing that, which might miniſter an advantage to render him odious or blame-worthy.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Which is yet higher, ſome even purſue and hunt for occaſions to calumniate and ſlander their brethren. The good Prophet <hi>Jeremie</hi> had ſtore of theſe ill neighbours (<hi>Jer:</hi> 20.10.) <hi>I have heard the defaming of many; feare is on every ſide; report, ſay they, and we will report it; all my familiars watched for my halting, ſaying, peradventure he will be inticed, and we ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile againſt him, and we ſhall take our revenge on him.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>How glad would not only my open familiars, but cloſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be, of an occaſion againſt me, it would make them leape for joy to ſee me halt.</hi> By his halting they meant his ſinning, his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which was uncomely, or not ſuitable to his profeſſion; they watched, they lay at catch for his halting, not to hold him up, but to caſt him downe. They ſayd, <hi>report, and we will report it;</hi> we will make ſomething or other of it, though in truth there be nothing. They had (which may be a fifth ſtep of this wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, a ſecret hope that he would halt and give them occaſion of inſulting. <hi>Peradventure</hi> (ſay they) <hi>he will be inticed,</hi> peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we ſhall catch him in this ſnare; this was their hope, and, if attained, their joy.</p>
                  <p>Which makes a 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ſtep of this wickedneſſe; For ſo <hi>David</hi> deſcribes his enemies (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 38.16, 17.) <hi>They rejoyce when my foot ſlippeth; for I am ready to halt,</hi> or (as we put in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin) <hi>for halting.</hi> There is a double halting, a halting by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and a halting by affliction; that I conceive <hi>David</hi> chiefly ſpake of in that place, becauſe he preſently adds in the cloſe of the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>And my ſorrow is continually before me.</hi> He ſhewes his enemies poſſeſſed with the ſame evill ſpirit, and in the ſame poſture (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 35.15.) <hi>In mine adverſity,</hi> or, <hi>in my halting, they rejoyced.</hi> The ſame word is uſed in this Pſalme for adverſity which we had in the 38<hi rend="sup">th</hi> for <hi>halting.</hi> This is as true of evill
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:104248:117"/> men, as halting is taken in the other notion, for ſinning. The wicked are as, if not more, ready to rejoyce at falls, or halts, by ſinning, as at falls or halts by ſuffering. In both theſe caſes (as <hi>David</hi> found in this 35<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Pſalme, <hi>v.</hi> 15.) the very abjects will teare the beſt of men (as they did <hi>David</hi>) and not ceaſe. But what doe they teare? their fleſh if they can; but to be ſure (and ſo 'tis meant there) their good names and reputation by ſlanders and accuſations. O how contrary is this practice and that joy to the ſpirit of the Goſpel! The Apoſtle tells us, the Grace of charity utterly abhorres it (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 13.6.) <hi>Charity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth not in iniquity.</hi> It neither rejoyceth in doing iniquity it ſelfe, nor to charge others with iniquity.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, (which is the higheſt ſtep) Some rather then faile will forme and frame occaſions againſt others; they will forge or fancy them in their own braine, and then accuſe their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as if they had been acting, what themſelves have been imagining. Such the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of (1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 3.16.) where admoniſhing Saints to much ſtrictneſſe and exactneſſe in walking, he gives this account, why they ſhould doe ſo, <hi>That whereas they ſpeak evill of you as evill doers, they may be aſhamed that falſely accuſe your good converſation in Chriſt.</hi> They who have not ſo much as a ſhadow of truth, will make ſomething out of a lie; they will falſely accuſe, and ſtrongly impeach, knowing that if they doe ſo, ſome of the dirt (at leaſt) will diſfigure the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſtick upon the skirts of thoſe who are impeached. Thus I have given ſeven degrees of this wickedneſs, every one of which plainly diſcover, and all put together, mightily aggravate the ſinfullneſs of this ſin, the ſeeking of occaſions againſt any man whoſoever, much more againſt any good man. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (which was the ſecond poynt propoſed for the clearing of this truth) you ſee how great a matter of charge was brought by <hi>Elihu</hi> againſt <hi>Job,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Job</hi> hath ſayd, <hi>He,</hi> (that is, God) <hi>ſeeketh occaſions againſt me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Secondly.</p>
                  <q>To charge the Lord with a willingneſſe to breake with us, either upon no occaſion, or to ſeeke an occaſion that he may, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſinfull, and diſhonourable to his Majesty, neere to Blaſphemy.</q>

                  <p>How ſinfull is it, that we who give the Lord ſo many occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt us, that he needs not ſeek any, ſhould yet ſay he ſeeketh occaſions againſt us? The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (as it appeares) intimated, at leaſt, that God had broken with them, or ſought occaſion to doe it (this word is uſed in that text, <hi>Numb:</hi> 14.34.) while the Lord to ſhew how ill he reſented ſuch thoughts and jealouſies of him, tells them, <hi>According to the number of the dayes in which ye ſearched the Land, even forty dayes (each day for a yeare) ſhall ye beare your iniquities, even forty yeares, and ye ſhall know my breach of promiſe,</hi> or (as read in the margin) <hi>my Altering of my purpoſe.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Ye ſhall know whether I have ſought occaſion againſt you,<note place="margin">Cognoſcetis confractionem meam; ſi dici poſſit latinè ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritationem; non a verbo irrito ſed ab adjectivo irritus, <hi>q.d.</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debitis ut ego omnia a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </note> whether I have fruſtrated your hopes and endeavours, theſe forty yeares in the wilderneſs or no; ye ſhall know whether I have done any thing to breake and entangle you, or whether all this hath nor proceeded from your owne frowardneſs and unbeliefe. The Lord who ſearched their hearts, and ſaw the utmoſt ſcope of their complaints, found this evill thought lying at the bottome of all, that he ſurely had put them upon all thoſe difficulties, or brought them into thoſe ſtraites on purpoſe to breake with them. And therefore, he ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhall know my breach of promiſe;</hi> Ye ſhall ſee one day, or at laſt, whether I have kept covenant, and ſtood to my engagement or you, whether I have ſought an occaſion againſt you, or you have given me occaſion to deale with you as I have done. So that when the Lord ſayd, <hi>Ye ſhall know my breach of promiſe;</hi> his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, ye ſhall know that I have kept my promiſe to you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, or to a tittle, and that ye only have been the promiſe-breakers. 'Tis infinitely below the nature of God, to ſeeke occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions againſt the creature; And 'tis ſtrange that the Jewes had any the remoteſt ſuſpition of him as doing ſo, after they had heard of thoſe glorious ſtiles and titles in which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed his name (<hi>Exod:</hi> 34.6.) <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, gracious and mercifull, ſlow to anger, abundant in goodneſſe and in truth, pardoning iniquity, tranſgreſſion, and ſin.</hi> What can be ſpeld out of this name that ſhould yeild the leaſt ſhaddow of a jealouſie, that the Lord would ſeeke occaſions againſt them. A good Prince deſires to finde many good ſubjects who deſerve to be rewarded, but it troubles him to finde any who deſerve to be puniſhed, or whom he is neceſſitated to puniſh; Now what is
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:104248:118"/> the goodneſſe of the moſt benigne and gracious Princes in the world, to the graciouſneſſe and benignity of God! Againe, his precious promiſes evidence the unworthineſſe of ſuch a ſurmiſe; all which are full of mercy, and goodneſſe, and patience, and pardon, and tenderneſſe to poore ſinners: ſo farre is the Lord from ſeeking occaſions to charge any one with what is not, that he ſeekes all the wayes and occaſions he can to doe good, and to extend compaſſion to thoſe who have done amiſſe. He even la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to deliver poore ſoules from their dangers, and from their ſins. How farre is he then from deſiring to find them tripping and ſinning, or from urging ſin hardly harſhly or cauſleſly upon them? yea all the experiences of Saints bring in witneſs againſt this blaſphemous apprehenſion. They will tell us from what they have found and felt, that when they have given the Lord occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to deſtroy them, when they have put a ſword into his hand to ſmite them, when by their unbeliefe, and pride, and neglect of knowne duties, they have layd themſelves open to ruine and deſtruction, even then he hath held his hand and ſpared them. Is it not then a great, a groſſe ſin, to charge the Lord, that he ſeekes occaſions againſt us? Yea indeed (as was touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) the Lord needs not ſeek occaſion againſt any man, for as much as the beſt of men give him too much occaſion, and too often. He needs not ſtand to ſpy advantages againſt us, we lay our ſelves too open and naked to him continually. As in Fence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when two that are very expert at that art are engaged, there is watching for an occaſion or advantage to get the maſtery; but if an expert Maſter of Defence be to deale with an ignorant fellow that knows not his poſtures, nor how to uſe his weapon, he needs not ſeeke occaſion, he may have him here and there and every where. It is ſo with the beſt of Saints, when they have to doe with God; He needs not watch for an occaſion where to hit, or ſmite them, for they through their ignorance and folly, lay their naked breaſts open to his ſtroakes every day. Were he not infinite in mercy to cover our ſins,<note place="margin">Ecce invenit in me vacilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones. <hi>Scult:</hi>

                        </gap>te in our brothers eye, we ſeldome ſee the beame in our owne.</hi> And it is an argument men have beames in their owne eyes, when they are ſo quick-ſighted in looking after motes in their brothers eye. I grant, it is a duty to be watchfull over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as brethren, and to take notice, for right ends, of the leaſt faylings and faults of any. This is a duty if we doe it with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to pray for them, that they may walke more circumſpectly; or that we may lovingly reprove, admoniſh, and counſell them; as alſo that we may conſider our ſelves and our owne wayes, leſt we fall as they have done. Thus to take notice of the leaſt fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of others, is a great Goſpel duty. But to take notice of mens faults, to cenſure or defame their perſons, to inſult over them, or accuſe them, this is the ſpirit of a <hi>Cham,</hi> who mocked at his fathers nakedneſs. And thus to be critticall about the faults of others, argues that we are careleſs of our owne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As to the particular caſe in the text, for which <hi>Job</hi> is tax'd by <hi>Elihu,</hi> that he ſaid thus of God.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>To ſay or think of the Lord that he takes a ſtrict and ſevere notice of our infirmities to reckon with us riggedly for them is very ſinfull.</q>
                  <p>Such thoughts are a great derogation from the goodneſſe and mercy of God. The Lord doth not willingly ſee the faults of his people; Though he ſeeth them, yet he doth not willingly ſee them; he is glad when it is with his people, as it was at that time with <hi>Iſrael</hi> (Numb: 23.21.) <hi>He hath not beheld iniquity in Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, neither hath he ſeene perverſneſs in Iſrael.</hi> But was there no ſin to be ſeene in <hi>Jacob?</hi> Was <hi>Iſrael</hi> altogether innocent at that time? Surely they, even they, and even then were a ſinfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and had their faults, neither few nor ſmall, but becauſe there was no iniquity, no perverſneſs nor prevarication againſt God
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:104248:119"/> found among them at that time, therefore he over-looked all their ordinary faylings and tranſgreſſions. As the Lord is ſo holy and of ſuch pure eyes that he cannot behold any ſin, the leaſt iniquity to approve of it (<hi>Habak.</hi> 1.13.) ſo the Lord is ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ſo full of compaſſion, that he doth not ſeverely take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, nor look upon the leſſer ſins of his people. <hi>David</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts the name and glory of God at large for this (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 103.8, 9, 10.) <hi>The Lord is mercifull and gracious, ſlow to anger, plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in mercy, he will not alwayes chide.</hi> They are alwayes chide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that are alwayes ſpying faults in children, ſervants or relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they who take notice of every little fault, ſhall finde chiding-worke enough in a family. <hi>But the Lord will not alwayes chide; neither will he keepe his anger for ever; He hath not dealt with us after our ſins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities: Like as a father pittieth his children, ſo the Lord pittieth them that feare him.</hi> A father doth not enquire into, much leſſe puniſh every neglect of his child. <hi>I will ſpare them</hi> (ſaith the Lord) (<hi>Mal:</hi> 3.17.) <hi>as a father ſpareth a ſon that ſerveth him.</hi> If a father ſeeth or is well perſwaded that his ſon hath a heart to ſerve him, he will not curiouſly ſpy out the faults of his ſervice, but ſaith to his child, <hi>It is well done,</hi> or at leaſt, I take that well which thou haſt done. Yea the Lord is ſo farre from a ſtrict inquiry after ſuch faults, that he paſſeth by great tranſgreſſions (<hi>Mic:</hi> 7.18.) <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his people; he retaineth not his anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in mercy.</hi> Though <hi>Aſa</hi> (1 Kings 15.14.) was not through in the reformation; the high places were not removed, yet the Lord did not charge this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, for preſently it followeth in the ſacred Story; <hi>Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, the heart of Aſa was perfect with God all his dayes.</hi> Yea; though <hi>Aſa</hi> did fall into ſeverall ſins afterwards, impriſoning one of the Prophets, and oppreſſing ſome of the people, and in his ſickneſs ſeeking to the Phyſitians, and not to the Lord, yet the Lord did not charge theſe acts upon him; He was ſo farre from a ſtrict inquiry after his leſſer ſins, that he tooke no notice of thoſe greater ſins, but ſaith, <hi>His heart was perfect all his dayes.</hi> So in the caſe of <hi>David,</hi> the Lord would not ſee many of his ſins, he would not blot <hi>David,</hi> nor burden his owne memory with them, but paſſed an Act of Oblivion upon them for ever.

Surely then he will not bring our infirmities and ſlips to account againſt us, while our hearts are upright with him.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee what matter of charge there was in theſe words, when <hi>Job</hi> ſayd, <hi>God ſought occaſion againſt him,</hi> when he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven none, or that he had only given ſome ſmaller occaſion, and yet God dealt with <hi>him as an enemy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But did <hi>Job</hi> ever ſay, That God ſought occaſions againſt him, or tooke notice of his leſſer ſins ſo ſeverely?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Though ſome acquit <hi>Job</hi> wholly of this charge, and recriminate <hi>Elihu</hi> with this accuſation as a ſlander, yet <hi>Job</hi> had ſpoken words which might give occaſion to charge him thus, (as was ſhewed alſo concerning thoſe former ſpeeches, <hi>I am cleane from tranſgreſſion, I am innocent, there is no iniquity in me</hi>) though <hi>Job</hi> had not ſpoken theſe or ſuch like words, with that ſcope and ſpirit as <hi>Elihu</hi> might ſeeme to alledge them; yet he had given <hi>Elihu</hi> cauſe enough to ſay ſo, while he ſpake more of himſelfe then came to his ſhare, conſidering that he was a ſinfull man, and more then did become him in his condition, being an afflicted man. Upon both which accounts, it had better becom'd him to have been much in humbling himſelfe, rather then at all in juſtifying himſelfe. Now as <hi>Job</hi> had ſpoken words which might beare out <hi>Elihu</hi> in his former charge,<note place="margin">Secundum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem neutru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diuit Job in ſenſu quem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponit in Elihu.</note> ſo we finde ſeverall ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or complaints concerning God, which may juſtifie him in this.

To lay up the evill deed of another, preſageth ill to him. And therefore when <hi>Elihu</hi> heard <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaking thus, might he not ſay, <hi>Job</hi> hath ſayd, <hi>God ſeeketh occaſions againſt me,</hi> yea, (which is more) as it followeth in the verſe under hand;
<q>And counteth me for his enemy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words having been inſiſted upon ſomewhat largely from other paſſages of this Booke (<hi>Chap:</hi> 13.24. &amp; 19.11. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.21. In all which places <hi>Job</hi> ſpake this complaint ſometimes expreſſely, alwayes Equivalently) I ſhall not here ſtay upon the explication of them, only for as much as <hi>Job</hi> having ſayd, That God took hold of ſmall occaſions given, or ſought occaſions not given, is preſently charged further by <hi>Elihu,</hi> with ſaying, <hi>He counteth me for his enemy.</hi> From this Connection of the former with the latter part of the verſe.</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>To ſeek or take eaſie occaſions against another, is an argument that we beare no good will to him, <hi>or,</hi> It is a ſigne we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man as an enemy, when we are apt and ready to ſeeke or take occaſions against him.</q>
                  <p>There are two things which we are very ready to doe towards thoſe we beare no good will un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o, or whom we account our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Firſt, to diminiſh the good which they doe, to ſpeak lightly of, and under-value their moſt prayſe-worthy deeds. Ill will never ſpake well either of perſons or actions. Secondly, whom we love not as friends, eſpecially whom we hate as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, we are prone to highten their faults, and double their fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; we (moſtly) look on the evill deeds of an enemy in a multiplying, or in a magnifying glaſs; we make one fault many,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:104248:121"/> and a little one great. A true friend will ſpeak the moſt of what is well done, and the leaſt he can, with truth, of what is ill; He is ſo farre from ſeeking occaſions againſt whom he loves, that he will hardly ſee them, when findes them unſought. A noble ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my will not ſeeke occaſions againſt a man, much leſſe will a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall friend. It is no wonder when <hi>Job</hi> is taxed with ſaying, God ſought occaſions againſt him, that he ſhould alſo ſay, <hi>He counteth me for his enemy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the matter of theſe words, <hi>He counteth me for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> take theſe two notes.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Even good men when they are ſorely grieved under the afflicting hand of God, are tempted to have hard apprehenſions of God, at leaſt to ſuſpect and feare that God is no friend to them.</q>
                  <p>And this comes to paſſe upon a double conſideration; Firſt, Nature when pinched will ſhew it ſelfe; Now, man naturally, hath not only hard thoughts of God, but an enmity againſt him. And when nature is pinched, all the corruptions working in man, worke this way, unleſs over-power'd and checkt by grace. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when 'tis hard with us from the hand of God, then Satan takes his time to prompt us with hard thoughts of God, and to foment that enmity to the uttermoſt, of which our corrupt nature hath ſuch ſtore. What? will Satan ſay, <hi>Doth God love thee, and ſtarve thee?</hi> What? Doth God pretend kindneſs to thee, and deale thus with thee? is God thy friend, who takes away thy friends? is God thy friend, who leaves thee in the hand of enemies? doth he pitty thee, and yet keepe thee in theſe paines? is this his kindneſs to his friend? How can he ſay he loves thee? And haſt not thou cauſe enough yet to ſay, <hi>He counteth thee for his enemy.</hi> Thus Satan takes his time to provoke nature, which is forward enough of it ſelfe to thinke and ſpeake hardly of God, if at any time he is pleaſed and ſees it fit to deale hardly with us. And how great a combate hath many a gracious ſoule both with Satan and his owne heart, to get and keepe up good and honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoughts of God in a ſuffering condition, or under darke and (to ſenſe) diſmal diſpenſations.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:104248:121"/>Whatſoever God doth to or with a godly man, he ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine good thoughts, and ſpeak well of God, <hi>or,</hi> when God deales moſt ſtrictly and ſeverely with his people, they ſhould not look upon it as an argument of any enmity or ill will againſt them, or that he counteth them his enemies.</q>
                  <p>Let us take heed of ſuch thoughts; <hi>David</hi> profeſſed (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 73.1.) <hi>Truly God is good to Iſrael, even to them that are of a cleane heart.</hi> He is good to them (that's <hi>Davids</hi> intent there) not only when he doth them good, (as to outward things I meane, and to ſencible appearances, for all is good in the iſſue to the Iſrael of God; now, I ſay, God is good to his people, not only when he in that ſence doth them good) but when he afflicts them, and layeth many outward evills upon them. When, as it is ſaid after in that Pſalme (<hi>v.</hi> 14.) <hi>He plagueth them</hi> (that word imports ſoreſt troubles) <hi>all the day long, and chasteneth them every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;</hi> when he gives them their breakfaſt in ſowre herbes, or with ſevereſt whippings, yet then, even then he is good to them, and meanes them no harme at all. Therefore how hardly ſoever God deals with us, let us not thinke he counts us enemies. The Temptation was ſtrong upon <hi>David</hi> to take up hard thoughts of God in that caſe, yea it prevailed ſo farre upon him, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded (<hi>v.</hi> 13.) <hi>Verily I have cleanſed my heart in vaine, and waſhed my hands in innocency.</hi> As if he had ſayd, A man hath little priviledge from the worſt of outward evills by his godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; But the Temptation did not prevaile long, he ſoone reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelfe (<hi>v:</hi> 15.) <hi>If I ſay I will ſpeak thus,</hi> (that is, that I have cleanſed my heart in vaine) <hi>Behold, I ſhould offend againſt the generation of thy children;</hi> that is, I ſhould wrong the whole kind or race of godly men throughout the world, as if hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, or as if God did not love them, or were not good to them, for who is there among all thy children whom either thou haſt not or mayeſt not chaſten as much as thou haſt chaſtned me. As no man can know the love of God by that which is before him, how proſperous ſoever it is; ſo it is moſt unſutable for any of the children of God, to thinke that God is not good to them, or doth not love them, becauſe of the evill that is before them, how adverſe or diſaſterous ſoever it is. For, God having loved his people in Chriſt, he loves them for ever; when once he hath
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:104248:122"/> broken the enmity in our hearts towards himſelfe, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall ever be done by him towards us, which may ſpeak us his enemies, or him our enemy, though a <hi>Job</hi> in great affliction may ſay, <hi>He counteth me for his enemy,</hi> And handles me like one too; as it followeth.</p>

                  <p>We had theſe words expreſſely (<hi>Chap:</hi> 13.27.) there they have been opened already, <hi>Thou putteſt my feet alſo in the ſtocks, and lookeſt narrowly unto all my pathes.</hi> That which hath been ſaid as to the Generall ſence and ſcope of that text, may ſerve for this; And therefore I referre the reader thither. I ſhall only adde two or three notes from the metaphor; <hi>He put my feet in the ſtocks,</hi> that is, he preſſeth me with very cloſe and ſore afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> To be in affliction, is to be in a painfull condition; there is little eaſe in the ſtocks.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No chaſtning for the preſent ſeemeth to be joyous but grievous (Heb:</hi> 12.11.) To be under a croſſe is be under a burden.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Afflictions keepe us under reſtraint.</hi> He hath little liberty as well as little eaſe that is in the ſtocks: afflictions hold us in, they are as a priſon to us. Afflictions are a reſtraint two wayes; Firſt, to our corruptions; yea, through the grace of God, afflictions are more then reſtraints to corruption, they become the death of corruption, they are appoynted (among other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices) for the mortifying of corruption, that it may not live in us, much more are they a reſtraint to corruption, that it may not get out, nor worke in us as before. Many times, when a good man hath the world at will, his corruptions thinke to have their will too; and when he is at liberty, luſts would grow licentious: Therefore God ſeeth it neceſſary to put his ſervants in the ſtocks, that their luſts may be in the ſtocks too. Thus he told the Church (<hi>Hoſ:</hi> 2.6.) <hi>Behold, I will hedge up thy way with thornes, and make a wall that ſhe ſhall not find her paths.</hi> The thorne-hedge was as a ſtocks to ſtop them that they ſhould not walk diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor act inordinately as they had done. This courſe God takes
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:104248:122"/> with many, he puts them in the ſtocks, that he may keepe them from the wayes of ſin, or give check to ſome unruly affection. When we need this diſcipline, we may looke for it, and 'tis a mercy to be under it. Will you not keep order? (ſaith God) then you ſhall to the ſtocks. Secondly, afflictions are a reſtraint to our comforts, as well as to our corruptions. As this expreſſion notes the taking of luſts ſhort, ſo the taking of us ſhort as to lawfull liberties and enjoyments. Sickneſs upon the body ſowres all that this world hath, to us, and will not ſuffer us to uſe much of it, how much ſoever of it we poſſeſſe. Many have enough to eate, who never eate in pleaſure, as <hi>Job</hi> ſayd (<hi>Chap:</hi> 21.25.) And when in our proſperity we run out and take unlawfull li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, God ſends an affliction, as his ſtocks, to hold us from our lawfull liberties. When we have had vaine out-goings and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of ſpirit, all going well with us and comfortably in the world, we may expect the ſtocks next, or that things ſhould goe ill with us, yet for our good.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To be in the ſtocks is a diſgracefull thing; it is not only a paine and a reſtraint, but it is a reproach; He that is in the ſtocks, or in the pillory, is expoſed to ſhame, every one poynts at him, and many revile him. Affliction as to the eye of the world, carrieth a diſgrace with it, or, at leaſt, ſubjects the perſon afflicted to diſgrace; And it hath been ſhewed from ſeverall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of this booke, how <hi>Job's</hi> afflictions were interpreted to his diſgrace; and he lookt upon, as I may ſay, like a vagabond in the ſtocks, that God had brought him thither, and clapt him by the heeles for his miſdemeanours. Though afflictions diminiſh no mans honour or eſteeme with God, or with his people (an afflicted Saint is as precious and honorable in their eyes, as when in the greateſt proſperity; The clouds of trouble cannot ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe the glory of Grace, nor render the gracious contemptible to thoſe who know them ſuch) yet, as to the eye and opinion of worldly men they doe. <hi>Job</hi> ſayd his afflictions were a witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, as if all were not right with him, yea, as if he had been very unrighteous. The ſtocks are a witneſs againſt a man, that ſurely he hath done ſome ill thing. Thus you ſee there is paine in affliction, reſtraint in affliction, diſgrace in affliction, eſpecially in the opinion of the world, and therefore to be in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is to be as in the ſtocks. <hi>He putteth my feet in the ſtocks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:104248:123"/>He marketh all my paths.</q>
                  <p>Which ſome expound, as if when the Lord had let him out of the ſtocks, yet he was but like a priſoner with his keeper at his heels; <hi>He marketh all my paths.</hi> I have ſpoken to this alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; I ſhall now only Note.</p>
                  <q>There is no ſtepping out of the eye or ſight of God.</q>
                  <p>He markes all our paths, not only our open paths, but our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret paths; not only what paths our feet walke in, but paths our hearts walke in. He marketh what our thoughts are, what our ſcope is, what our aymes and ends are. He marketh not only our day-paths, but our night-paths; <hi>He watcheth all our paths.</hi> Take this Caution from it;
<q>As the Lord marks all our paths, ſo it will be our wiſdome to mark our owne paths.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Lords eye be ſo ſtrict over all our wayes, ſhall we be careleſſe of our wayes? If he look upon our walkings, ſhall not we look to our walkings? There are many arguments (from love, from returns of thankfulneſs for received benefits) which ſhould provoke the people of God to heed and marke their own wayes; but ſurely this ought to be a very cogent argument, becauſe God marks them, <hi>He marketh all our paths.</hi> Therefore as the Apoſtle gives counſel and admonition (<hi>Eph:</hi> 5.15.) <hi>See that ye walke circumſpectly, not as fooles but as wiſe.</hi> What our wiſdome is, yea whether we have any wiſdome, whether we are wiſe or fooles will be ſeene by our walkings. Some can talke and diſcourſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wiſely, who yet walke very fooliſhly, and whoſe whole courſe is folly.</p>
                  <p>So much for the opening of this charge brought by <hi>Elihu</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Job,</hi> his over-juſtifying of himſelfe, and his reflecting upon the goodneſſe and love of God. <hi>Elihu</hi> proceeds yet further to deale with and refute him, as alſo to anſwer for God. <hi>Behold, in this thou art not juſt,</hi> &amp;c. This I charge thee with and will prove it, thou haſt ſpoken ſinfully and unbecommingly of God and of thy ſelfe in all this.</p>

                     </note>There is a third antecedent, which we may take up from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall paſſages in the former part of the Booke; and that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt ſo often and ſo importunately deſired to plead with God, and haſt made ſo many ſuites for a hearing with him, as if thou hadſt ſomewhat to ſay, which might acquit thy ſelfe and ſhew reaſon, why God ſhould not deale thus with thee; For though <hi>Job</hi> did not deſire to plead with God as having any intent to accuſe him of doing him wrong, yet he was therefore to be blamed, becauſe he deſired to plead with him; ſeeing it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes man to ſubmit to the judgement of God without murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or complaining. So then <hi>Elihu</hi> had cauſe to charge him with this; God indeed paſſed it by, as knowing it did not proceed (as in the wicked) from malice, but from weakneſs and ignorance, as <hi>Job</hi> alſo himſelfe humbly confeſſed at laſt. <hi>Behold</hi> (thou haſt too often called for Juſtice) <hi>in this thou art not juſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr <hi>Broughton</hi> renders, <hi>Loe here thou art not in the right.</hi> Theſe words, <hi>in this, or here,</hi> may alſo have a negative reference to what <hi>Job</hi> had been charged with before by his friends. As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſayd; <hi>I doe not charge thee with ſuch crimes as thy friends have loaded thee with heretofore, I doe not burden thee with groſſe impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor with hypocriſie, I doe not tell thee thou haſt oppreſſed the poore, or wronged the widdow and the fatherleſſe, I have nothing of this ſort to ſay againſt thee. But in this or here, I have ſomewhat to ſay, wherein my judgement alſo is that thou art not juſt, nor in the right; for however thou art otherwiſe, or in other things upright and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, however juſt thou haſt been in thy tranſactions with men, and pure in thy worſhip toward God, yet in this I am ſure, and I dare ſay it openly and avowedly, thou art no wayes justifiable, much leſſe juſt in that thou haſt cryed up thy owne innocency, and ſpoken ſo much of the hard dealings of God with thee; yea, haſt been ſo bold as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a day of hearing even before God himſelfe.</hi> Let this be the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion or matter under debate; <hi>Whether or no, Job ſpeaking thus highly of himſelfe, and thus boldly of God, hath done right or no? Elihu</hi> undertakes the negative, he engageth to prove that <hi>Job</hi> had not done well, or right, how innocent ſoever he was, in ſpeaking
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:104248:124"/> ſo much of his own innocency, or (how hardly ſoever God dealt with him) in making ſo many complaints of his ſeverity, <hi>Elihu</hi> undertakes to prove this negative; and <hi>Job</hi> never durſt undertake the affirmative, that he had done right or well in ſpeaking or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo; and therefore in the cloſe of the buſineſs he ſits downe convinced, that he had been too bold with God, and too forward in juſtifying himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>His argument (which runs through this whole diſcourſe) to make good his negative aſſertion, may be formed up thus; <hi>He that ſpeakes much of his owne righteouſneſſe, and ſeemes to reflect upon the righteouſneſſe of God, at leaſt that God hath been over-rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous with him, is not juſt, nor juſtifiable in this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But thou O Job haſt ſpoken thus of thy ſelfe, and thus of God in the extremity of thy paine, and in the anguiſh of thy ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore in this thou art not juſt, nor juſtifiable.</hi> No man of underſtanding can take thy part, or be an Advocate for thee in this matter; As for me, I muſt needs be and am reſolved to be an Advocate for God againſt thee. The Major or firſt propoſition is not expreſt in the text, the concluſion is given in the beginning of the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, and the aſſumption or 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> propoſition, is collected from <hi>Job's</hi> owne mouth in ſeverall places of this Booke.</p>
                  <p>Againe, beſides the generall ſcope of the words, and the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of <hi>Elihu</hi> in this diſpute, we may conſider the manner of his ſpeech, how he deales with <hi>Job; Behold, in this thou art not just.</hi> In this manner of treating with <hi>Job,</hi> the ſweetneſſe of his ſpirit, and likewiſe the boldneſſe of it are obſervable. Theſe two ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues or excellencies of an Advocate, ſhew themſelves plainly in this one paſſage; <hi>Behold, in this thou art not juſt.</hi> For conſider, Firſt, He expreſſeth his reproofe negatively, he doth not ſay, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, in this thou art wicked, or thou haſt impiouſly blaſphem'd the name of God, but he ſpeakes at as low a rate, as may be, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, in this thou art not juſt, or juſtifiable,</hi> thou haſt not done right, or thou art not right; there is a great good temper of ſpirit, and a mixture of much meekneſſe in ſuch negative expreſſions: it being much leſſe to ſay to a man, <hi>in this thou art not juſt nor juſtifiable;</hi> then to ſay poſitively or directly, in this thou art unjuſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveſt to be condemned. For though there be no difference in the thing between not being juſt and being unjuſt, yet there is much more mildneſs in the words; and a man takes leſſe offence,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:104248:125"/> when told that he is not juſt, then in being told that he is unjuſt. The imputing of a crime to a man, is more and worſe, then the denying him a vertue, or that he is vertuous.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>We ought to temper our reproofes with much gentleneſſe and meekneſſe.</q>
                  <p>We ſhould not ſpeake cutting words, if other words will ſerve the turne. Thus the Apoſtle directs us (<hi>Gal:</hi> 6.1.) <hi>Brethren, if a man be overtaken with a fault, ye which are ſpirituall, reſtore ſuch a one with the ſpirit of meekneſſe, conſidering thy ſelfe, leſt thou alſo be tempted;</hi> deale as gently with a fallen brother, as thou wouldeſt with a man whoſe bones are diſlocated or broken (ſo much the metaphor there uſed imports) There is a time indeed when we muſt rebuke (as the Apoſtle gives direction (<hi>Tit:</hi> 1.13.) <hi>ſharply,</hi> or cuttingly; we muſt goe to the quicke, <hi>that they may be found in the faith:</hi> but there is a great regard to be had to the ſtate and ſpirits of thoſe with whom we have to deale. As it is our duty to receive the word with meekneſſe (<hi>James</hi> 1.21. ſome receive the word proudly, riggidly, in the worſt ſence they can, yea they receive it rebellingly, now as we ought to receive the word with meekneſſe) ſo 'tis good to ſpeake the word with meekneſſe, with as much meekneſſe and tenderneſſe as the caſe will beare.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, conſider this manner of ſpeaking, <hi>Behold, in this thou art not juſt, Elihu</hi> tells him plainly of his faults, he reported them before, and here he applyed them home to his perſon; <hi>Behold, in this,</hi> thou remembereſt thy owne words; Thou canſt not but take notice what thou haſt ſpoken; now I tell thee, <hi>in this thing thou art not juſt; Elihu</hi> doth not ſpeak doubtingly nor fearefully, nor doth he tell <hi>Job</hi> what the thoughts of others were upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but he tells him directly, categorically, plainly from himſelfe, <hi>in this thou art not juſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>We are to hold out our convictions and reproofes with plainneſſe, and to lay our finger upon the very ſore; Behold, in this <hi>(or that)</hi> thou art not juſt.</q>
                  <p>We are to ſpeake meekly, but not at randome, not uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:104248:125"/> not flatteringly (<hi>Pro:</hi> 29.25.) <hi>A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a net for his feete;</hi> he doth but intangle and inſnare him, in ſtead either of counſelling or comforting him. When a man is out, it is beſt to tell him ſo; how elſe ſhall he get in againe? Flattering words are inſnaring words; <hi>Behold, in this thou art not right.</hi> One of the Ancients ſpeaking to this poynt,<note place="margin">Majore ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio dignus eſt qui male agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes laudat; quam qui male agit. <hi>Chryſoſt:</hi>
                     </note> tells us; <hi>It is more ſinfull to flatter thoſe that doe evill, then to doe evill our ſelves.</hi> And, ſurely it argueth a more corrupt mind, or a worſer principle to dawbe ſinners with the untempered morter of flattery, then to be dawbed with the mire of any particular ſin or iniquity. A flatterer is a dawber and pillow-ſower; A flatterer hath not a true ſight of ſin himſelfe, and he doth what he can to keepe others from the ſight of it. It is ſafer to make ſinners ſmart then itch. <hi>David</hi> invited a wound<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

No man had ever any cauſe to repent, either the giving or receiving of a wiſe and ſeaſonable reproofe.</p>
                  <q>Behold, in this thou art not juſt.</q>
                  <p>But what is it, not to be juſt? I anſwer, not to be juſt, is not to give every man his due; yet <hi>Elihu</hi> intends it chiefly, of what <hi>Job</hi> had ſpoken unduely to God; <hi>Behold, in this thou art not juſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>

                  <p>Yea not to give God his right, is by ſo much the greater inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, then not to give man his right, by how much God is greater then man; looke how much God is higher and greater then man, by ſo much is their ſin higher and greater, who give not God his right, then theirs, who give not man his right.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:104248:126"/> when a man is able to ſay he is juſt to his neighbour, no man can challenge him of injuſtice. But many ſay this, who take no notice, how unjuſt they are to God; they are not at all ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, how often they have denied God his right, nor how often they have done God wrong; they take no notice of this. They have ſecond-table Juſtice, but they have not firſt-table Juſtice; this is it that <hi>Elihu</hi> chargeth <hi>Job</hi> with.

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:104248:127"/> then what is any man in account to God? O what man or Angel is able to caſt up the account, how much the great God <hi>is greater or more then man.</hi> The words are plaine, only there is ſomewhat yet to be added or touched upon, to cleare up further the ſcope of <hi>Elihu</hi> in ſpeaking thus to <hi>Job,</hi> which I ſhall endeavour to cleare and make out, when I have given a note or two from the words, as they are a plaine propoſition; <hi>God is greater then man.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt;</hi> God is Great.</q>
                  <p>He that is greater then the Greateſt, is certainly great; he that is higher then the higheſt, is high. This greatneſs of God is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where celebrated in Scripture. The Prophet (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 12.6.) calls <hi>the inhabitant of Zion to cry out and ſhout;</hi> why? <hi>For great is the holy One of Iſrael in the midſt of thee;</hi> that is, the holy one of <hi>Iſrael</hi> who is in the midſt of thee, is both Great in himſelfe, and declares his greatneſs in thee. (<hi>Mal:</hi> 1.14.) <hi>I am a great King, ſaith the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadfull among the heathens.</hi> I need not ſtay to give particular Scriptures to hold forth the attribute of Gods greatneſs, his greatneſs runs through all his attributes. Whatſoever God is, he is great in it; He is great in power (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 56.3. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 147.5.) he is great in all ſorts of power, great in authoritative power, and great in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative power. As God commandeth what he pleaſeth to be done, ſo he can doe what he commandeth. The power of man in doing is not alwayes commenſurate with his power in commanding; but Gods is. He needs no helpe, much leſſe any leave to execute what he willeth. Againe, God is great in wiſdome, he hath the compaſſe of all things in his underſtanding; God is ſo wiſe, that he is called <hi>the only wiſe God</hi> (1 Tim: 1.17.) The wiſdome of men and Angels is folly to his. God is great alſo in his goodnes, ſo great that Chriſt himſelfe as man would not be called <hi>good,</hi> but told him that called him ſo by way of rebuke, <hi>There is none good but one, that is God</hi> (Math: 19.17.) Holy <hi>David</hi> brake out into the admiration of that goodneſs which God hath layd up, yea of that which he dayly worketh for man. How much more did he and ought we to admire that goodneſs which is not ſo much in himſelfe as himſelfe? (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 31.19.) <hi>O how great is thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which thou haſt layd up for them that feare thee, which thou
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:104248:127"/> workeſt for them that truſt upon thee before the ſons of men.</hi> The goodneſſe which God acts and puts forth for the creature, is a great goodneſſe (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 63.7. <hi>Neh:</hi> 9.25<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>) but that goodneſſe which is the goodneſſe of his nature, is a goodneſſe as great as God is, a goodneſſe infinite in greatneſſe. Againe, how often is God called great, yea admired for his greatneſſe <hi>in mercy?</hi> When <hi>David</hi> (2 Sam: 24.14.) made choyce to fall into the hands of God; he gave this reaſon of it, <hi>For his mercies are great.</hi> He is alſo great in wrath; we read (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.26.) of <hi>the fierceneſſe of his great wrath.</hi> And how great is his Love? Firſt, in redeeming us by Chriſt (<hi>Joh:</hi> 3.16.) <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> &amp;c. God loved us ſo much in that gift, that no man could ever tell how much love he hath given us in it. Secondly, His love is great in quickning us with Chriſt (<hi>Eph:</hi> 2.4.) <hi>God who is rich in mercy, for the great Love wherewith he hath loved us, even when we were dead in ſins, hath quickned us together with Chriſt.</hi> His love both in redeeming and quickning us is ſo great, that while we are called to the greateſt ſtudy after the knowledge of, we are told we cannot know the greatneſſe of it, (<hi>Eph:</hi> 3.18.) <hi>That you may know the Love of God which paſſeth knowledge.</hi> I will not ſtay upon this Attribute, the Greatneſſe of God, onely take theſe five briefe inferences from it; <hi>God is Great.</hi> Then</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>God can doe great things, the greateſt things, for us; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is in working as it is in being;</hi> they that are but little, can doe but little; God being great in his being, that is, in his power, in his wiſdome, in his goodneſſe, in his mercy, how eaſily can he doe great things! The Scripture is abundant in ſhewing forth the great things which God hath done, and will doe, 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 7.22, 23. <hi>Job</hi> 5.9. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 71.19. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 86.10. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 92.5. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 111.2. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 126.2, 3. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 136.7, 17. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.21. The workes of God in all ages and in all places, have borne the ſtamp of and given teſtimony to his excellent Greatneſſe. We ſay, <hi>There is nothing great to a great mind, or to a man of a great ſpirit.</hi> A Great ſpirited man will overcome not only great difficulties, but ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſibilities, yea he is glad to meete with greateſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, becauſe they match the greatneſſe of his mind. Then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Great God, doth nothing but great, and can doe the greateſt things. 'Tis no matter how great the things are which
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:104248:128"/> we have need to be done for us, if we can but intereſt the Great God in the doing of them. God can doe great things in wayes of mercy for his people, and he can doe great things in wayes of Judgement againſt his enemies. Though his enemies be Great Oakes and Cedars, he can hew them downe (<hi>Amos</hi> 2.9.) Though his enemies be as great as the greateſt mountaines, he can remove and level them; <hi>Who art thou, O great mountaine before Zoroba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, thou ſhalt become a plaine</hi> (Zech: 4.7.) that is, the great power of God, with <hi>Zorobabell,</hi> can overthrow or overturne thoſe powers which oppoſe or ſtand in the way of his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though they appeare as inſeparable and immoveable as a Great Mountaine.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If <hi>God be Great,</hi> then he can pardon great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; you that are great ſinners feare not. Were not God a great God, the leaſt of our ſins could not be pardoned; were not he great in mercy, and great in goodneſſe, our hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s would fayle us, yea our faith could have no bottome to come to him for the pardon of our great ſins; But why ſhould great ſins diſcourage us to aske their pardon of God, who is great in mercy? <hi>David</hi> made the greatneſſe of his ſin his argument to move the Lord to pardon it (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 25.11.) <hi>Pardon my ſin for it is great;</hi> who could ſpeak thus, unleſſe he had that upon his heart that he ſpake to the great God, who is greater in nothing, and hath magnified his greatneſſe in nothing more then in acts of mercy to Greateſt ſinners?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If God be a great God; then he muſt have great ſervices and duties; He muſt have great praiſe (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 48.1.) <hi>great is the Lord and greatly to be praiſed;</hi> he muſt have great love, we muſt love him even with all our heart, and with all our might. He muſt have great feare (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 89.7.) Great faith (<hi>Math:</hi> 15.28.) Great honour from all his people. When <hi>David</hi> was about to make great preparations for the building of the Temple, he ſaith (1 <hi>Chron:</hi> 29.11.) <hi>Thine O Lord is greatneſſe, and the power, and the glory,</hi> &amp;c. And when <hi>Solomon</hi> was about to build the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he ſaith (2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 2.5.) <hi>The houſe which I build is great, for great is our God above all Gods.</hi> We ſee <hi>David</hi> prepared and <hi>Solomon</hi> builded in proportion to the God for whom the one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and the other built a houſe. Thus I may ſay of all you doe for God or to God, let it be the greateſt your ſtocke and ability
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:104248:128"/> can reach to, becauſe he is a great God. The Lord himſelfe uſeth that argument by the Prophet to urge his people to doe their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in whatſoever they were called to doe (<hi>Mal:</hi> 1.14.) <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the deceiver which hath a male in his flocke, and voweth and ſacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing;</hi> (that is, who when he is able to performe a greater ſervice to the Lord, puts him off with a leſſer one) <hi>for I am a great King, ſaith the Lord of hoſts,</hi> &amp;c. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed of putting me off with weake female ſervices, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a male, your beſt, that ſervice which is moſt ſpirituall and maſculine.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If God be great, then, they who are but little them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, having an intereſt in God, may doe great things too. The leaſt creature having an intereſt in the great God, is as great, yea infinitely greater then the greateſt in the world, who ſtand in their owne ſtrength. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith (<hi>Deut:</hi> 4.38. <hi>Deut:</hi> 7.1.) that the preſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e of God with <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſuch, that by it they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame Nations, greater and mightier then they; their little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe did not hinder them, becauſe the great God was with them in their workes and wayes; yea God loves to uſe ſmall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that his owne greatneſſe who is the efficient may appeare. That queſtion which was twice put in the Prophet (<hi>Amos</hi> 7.2, 5.) is very often put in that caſe; <hi>By whom ſhall Jacob ariſe? for he is ſmall.</hi> That which made it ſo queſtionable whether <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould riſe, was his ſmallneſs; And could we remember the Greatneſs of the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> we ſhould either never make ſuch queſtions, or eaſily anſwer them.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Seeing God is great, we ſhould be alwayes aſcribing greatneſſe to God, we ſhould lift him up in his greatneſſe. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> exhorted others (<hi>Deut:</hi> 32.3.) <hi>Becauſe I will publiſh the name of the Lord, aſcribe ye greatneſſe to our God.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> at once prophecieth the ſame of others, and promiſeth it for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 145.6.) <hi>Men ſhall ſpeake of the might of thy terrible Acts, and I will declare thy greatneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, Conſider theſe words as they are expreſſed compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, <hi>God is greater then man;</hi> As God is great, ſo greater then the greateſt men. God is great above all Gods; that is, above all the Kings and Princes of the earth. <hi>Now I know</hi> (ſayd <hi>Jethro, Exod:</hi> 18.11.) <hi>that God is greater then all Gods</hi> (greater then <hi>Rharoah</hi> and his <hi>Egyptian</hi> Princes) <hi>for in the thing wherein they
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:104248:129"/> dealt proudly he was above them. David</hi> challenged all the Gods on Gods behalfe (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 77.13.) <hi>Who is ſo great a God as our God?</hi> Let any man name him if he can; He is a God above all Gods, that is, above the greateſt powers in this world who are called Gods. Thus Chriſt comforts believers with an aſſurance of ſafety for ever (<hi>John</hi> 10.29.) <hi>My father is greater then all,</hi> then the devill and all.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, who knoweth not this that God is Great, or that he is greater then men or devills? <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe ſpake much of this ſubject, yea his friends made it their buſineſſe to exalt the greatneſſe of God, as we may ſee in ſeverall paſſages of this Booke. So that <hi>Elihu</hi> ſeemeth to ſay no more here, then had been ſayd already, and doth no more then hath been done already. Is not this then a cold way of arguing to tell <hi>Job</hi> that which he knew already?</p>
                  <p>For anſwer to this I ſhall ſtay a while (as was promiſed) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I goe off from theſe words, to ſhew why though for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this is no more then hath been ſayd already; that, yet <hi>Elihu</hi> had reaſon to bring this argument for the conviction of <hi>Job,</hi> that <hi>God is greater then man;</hi> for though the Greatneſſe of God hath been often ſpoken of in the courſe of this diſputation, between <hi>Job</hi> and his friends, yet neither <hi>Job</hi> nor his friends did handle or improve it to that poynt, or in that extent, as here intended by <hi>Elihu,</hi> as may appeare by theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpake of the greatneſſe of God, we are not to underſtand this greatneſſe abſtractly or alone, but concreetely or in conjunction with his goodneſſe and righteouſneſſe, with his mercy and faithfulneſſe, <hi>&amp;c. Job</hi> confeſſed the greatneſſe of God, but he ſeemed to intimate ſeverall things, to the diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the goodneſſe, mercy, and righteouſneſſe of God. For though in his frequent complainings he did not queſtion, yet he did much darken and obſcure theſe Divine perfections. And therefore <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Greatneſſe</hi> of God, urgeth it in conjunction with all his perfections, and indeed they cannot be diſ-joyned, except in notion or diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Elihu</hi> inſiſted ſo much upon the greatneſſe of God, to humble <hi>Job,</hi> and to convince him that he had done amiſſe, in his bold appeales to him and complaints, about his dealing with him. <hi>Elihu</hi> doth wiſely to hold out the greatneſſe and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:104248:129"/> of God, for the keeping downe and repreſſion of his yet, unhumbled ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Elihu</hi> mannageth this argument for another end and purpoſe, then his friends did. They uſed it to prove <hi>Job</hi> was wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked or had done wickedly in the former paſſages of his life; He to ſhew that <hi>Job</hi> ought to be patient under and quietly ſubmit to the preſent providences of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This argument which <hi>Elihu</hi> brings from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, hath not at all the leſſe force in it, becauſe ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſo common and generally received a principle, <hi>the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God;</hi> yea, it hath therefore the greater force in it; for what is more unreaſonable then for man to intimate any thing which reflects upon God, or to complaine of what God doth; when as God, by the common conſent of all reaſonable men, doth infinitely ſurpaſſe all men, both in greatneſſe, and in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, both in Juſtice, and in goodneſſe. When the greatneſſe of God appeares in all theſe things, what can be more unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable then for man to inſinuate any thing complainingly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God. From the conſideration of this ſcope which <hi>Elihu</hi> had in arguing from the greatneſſe of God;</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>We may ſpeake and believe aright, that God is great, and that he is greater then man, and yet not anſwer it in our practiſe, nor be duly affected with it.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> did not at all queſtion whether <hi>Job</hi> thought God grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then himſelfe; that was not the poynt in controverſie: but he ſaw this principle was not anſwered in <hi>Jobs</hi> practiſe, or that he did not demeane himſelfe ſutably to the Greatneſſe of God, which he had proclaimed to others, and profeſſed himſelfe to believe. And thus it is with many, moſt of all with thoſe under great temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and preſſing afflictions. How apt are they to ſpeake and act below, yea beſide thoſe principles which they believe and hold forth in their profeſſion. It is an eaſie matter to ſay, and in words to acknowledge what God hath revealed himſelfe to be, but O how hard is it to live and walke up to ſuch ſayings and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements? Many tell us, God is greater then man, yet while they doe not fully ſubject themſelves to God, they in effect deny that God is greater then man. Many acknowledge fully
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:104248:130"/> that God is righteous, yet when they reſt not in his dealings with them, they imply ſome unrighteouſneſſe in God. Many ſay God is wiſe, only wiſe, yet while they will be their owne carvers, and are unſatisfied with Gods allowances and providences; they make themſelves wiſer then God, or at leaſt imagine things might be ordered with Greater wiſdome then they are. Many ſay God is great in mercy, greater infinitely then man, yet when they ſhould act faith about the pardon of their ſins, they act it as if God had but the mercy of a man, or as if his <hi>thoughts were as our thoughts, and his wayes</hi> (in diſpencing favours) <hi>like our wayes,</hi> and ſo they bring God downe to their owne ſize and ſcantlings. If theſe had been asked the queſtion, whether God hath not greater mercy then man, they would have anſwered, doubtleſſe he hath; and yet they are no more in believing, then if the mercy of God were of the ſame meaſure with the mercies of narrow-hearted man. Thus we modle the Great God, and our Idea's or apprehenſions of him according to what we ſee in our ſelves, not according to what he is and hath ſaid of himſelfe. And what are our righteſt notions of God, but hoverings in the ayre, till we bring them downe into practiſe, or live up to them, till every thing we doe be an expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of what we ſpeake and believe of God. And when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve indeed that God is greater then man, we make our ſelves juſt nothing before God: if we are any thing to our ſelves, or glory in any thing of our owne, be it little or great before God, we do not give God the glory of his greatneſſe. The Lord ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his owne greatneſſe by the Prophet, ſaith, <hi>All nations are but as the drop of the bucket to him, yea they are as a little thing, as nothing, leſſe then nothing;</hi> if therefore you make not every thing little, yea nothing before God, you detract from the glory of his greatneſſe. Againe, they only acknowledge God in his greatneſſe, who both agree to all he doth as juſt, and receive it as good, yea as beſt, how bad ſoever it be to nature, or bitter to their ſence. Once more, they only acknowledge God fully in his greatneſſe, who though God changeth and varieth his diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions every day with them, though he empty them never ſo often from veſſell to veſſell, yet ſit downe and ſay, God is unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them. It is becauſe the Lord changeth not that we are not conſumed (<hi>Mal:</hi> 3.6.) therefore what changes ſoever his people meete with, his heart and thoughts towards them are not changed.</p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:104248:130"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>The very reaſon why we doe not ſtoop to God in ſilence, why we doe not ſuffer him quietly to doe with us and diſpoſe of us how he will, is, becauſe we doe not lay to heart as we ought the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God.</q>
                  <p>Did we remember, that the great God is great in goodneſſe, and great in wiſdome, as well as great in power; in a word, did we, when we ſay God is great, and greater then any man, know what we ſay, it would preſently ſtop our mouthes, and for ever ſilence all our diſcontents &amp; complainings, whether in reference to our perſonall or the publick concernments. We may pray that God would remove any affliction or evill that is upon us (to doe is ſo not only our liberty but our duty) but we may not complaine of any affliction, as an evill to us, nor would we ever make ſuch a complaint, if our hearts were taken up with this thought, that God is great in Goodneſſe. Why doe we ſay, at any time, Surely we have ſuffered enough, or too much already? Why doe we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſo curiouſly wherefore God ſhould uſe ſuch ſeverity againſt us? What is the reaſon of all this? even this, we doe not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der enough of his greatneſſe. <hi>All our inward troubles at our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward troubles ariſe from this, becauſe we doe not enough believe or not remember who God is.</hi> We by our ignorance and unbeliefe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt God (as much as in us lyeth) of his great goodneſſe and wiſdome, when we feare, eſpecially when we conclude, things are not ordered for our good. And though every man is ready to ſay, he loathes yea trembles at ſuch thoughts, yet we may lodge many ſuch gueſts befo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e we are aware. <hi>Whenſoever we are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved at any affliction, our owne or others, or would</hi> (without much free ſubmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſion to the will of God) <hi>have things goe otherwiſe then they doe, we, upon the matter, make our ſelves greater and wiſer then God.</hi> And though this be farre from our purpoſe, yet we cannot avoyd the imputation of it. That which is not (as ſome diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h) the aime, ſcope, and intendment of the ſpeaker or actor may yet be the aime and ſcope of his action, worke or ſpeech; no doubt <hi>Job</hi> was very farre from the leaſt thought of diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much more of denying the greatneſſe of God, either in his power, wiſdome, or goodneſſe, yea (as was granted before) he ſpake very highly of him in all theſe his glorious and divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:104248:131"/> It was not his end when he ſpake ſo impatiently and complainingly,<note place="margin">Finis operis li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet non operan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</note> to rob God of that honour of his greatneſſe, yet <hi>Elihu</hi> did him no wrong when he ſayd his impatience and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings did it. And if any ſhall be found complaining like <hi>Job,</hi> though they doe not formally deny, that God is greater rhen man, yet that interpretation and conſtruction may juſtly be put upon their complaints.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may here object and ſay, how was <hi>Job</hi> ſuch a mirror, ſuch a patterne of patience, as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> makes him (<hi>Chap:</hi> 5.11.) if he manifeſted ſo much impatience as might be interpreted by others, though not intended by him a deniall of the Greatneſſe of God?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, though all agree (and the teſtimony of the Spirit of God is enough to confirme it, though all ſhould not agree) that the patience of <hi>Job</hi> was exceeding great, yet no man may ſay (nor doth the Spirit of God, in Scripture, ſay it) that his patience was perfect; his patience was ſuch as exceeded the moſt, yea (for ought that we know) the beſt of men, yet his was but the patience of a man, of a man compaſſed about with the like paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as other men. His patience was ſincere and without hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, but his patience was not compleate nor without infirmity; or his patience (we may ſay) was perfect as to the kind, but it was not perfect as to the degree. His patience deſerved both commendation and imitation; yet he ſhewed (at times) ſuch impatience as deſerved reproofe, and ſhould not be imitated but mortified and avoyded. Good men doe not only act leſſe in goodneſſe ſometimes, but ill and much amiſſe. And while we ſee talleſt Cedars fayle (they ſhall not utterly fall, <hi>Job</hi> did not) <hi>Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth</hi> (that is, who hath a ſtrong opinion of his owne ſtrength) <hi>take heed leſt he fall,</hi> (as the Apoſtle cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions him, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 10.12.) for even the impatient complaints of <hi>Job</hi> in his ſufferings (like thoſe ſufferings of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for their ſins ſpoken of in the former verſes of that Chapter) fell from him for an enſample (or type) and are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</p>

                  <p>The words are a reproving queſtion; As if he had ſayd, Thou doſt ill, very ill to ſtrive. There is a four-fold ſtriving, three of which are held forth in Scripture under the word of the text.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a legall ſtriving, a ſtriving by way of plea, about matters of right and title. The word in the text chiefly imports ſuch a judiciary ſtriving, a ſtrife in law, when the adverſe party or <hi>Plaintiffe</hi> impleads and commenſeth his ſuit againſt the <hi>Defendant.</hi> Striving is taken in this ſence and joyned with war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the deſcription of that conteſt which <hi>Jephtah</hi> had with the King of the Children of <hi>Ammon</hi> (Judg: 11.25.) <hi>And now art thou any thing better then Balak the ſon of Zippor king of Moab? did he ever ſtrive againſt Iſrael? or did he ever fight againſt them?</hi> That is, did he either make warre with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or did he ſo much as challenge and plead his right to their land by law? That other name which <hi>Joaſh Gideons</hi> father occaſionally gave him (<hi>Judg:</hi> 6.31, 32.) takes part from this word; <hi>Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, ſaying, Let Baal plead againſt him, becauſe he hath throwne downe his altar.</hi> As if he had ſayd, Let <hi>Baal</hi> come and enter his action againſt my Son if he pleaſe; and let my Son alone to anſwer him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a logicall ſtriving, or a ſtriving by dint of argument and reaſon. Thus diſputants ſtrive; and Books of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie about matters of faith and worſhip are called Bookes of <hi>Polemicall Divinity.</hi> Nor indeed hath any kind of ſtrife been carried on with higher and hotter animoſities then thoſe manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by tongue and pen in writing and diſputing.</p>

                  <p>I find a learned tranſlater among the Modernes, who taking the latter part of the verſe as a reaſon given by <hi>Job</hi> of his ſtriving with God ſpoken of in the firſt,<note place="margin">Quare adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus eum litigas quod de omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus rebus ſuis non reſpondeat. <hi>Jun:</hi>

But conſider, man? art thou well in thy wits? knoweſt thou what thou doſt, or ſayeſt? wilt thou a poore narrow-hearted creature take it ill at the hands of the great God, and as it were ſtrive with him, btcauſe he doth not render a reaſon of all his matters, and expound all his doings unto thee?</hi> The argument may be formed thus.</p>

                  <q>For he giveth not account of any of his matters.</q>
                  <p>This I conceive the beſt and cleareſt rendring of theſe words, which thus underſtood yeilds us ſeverall uſefull obſervations: Firſt, upon the whole matter, thus:
<q>
                        <pb n="247" facs="tcp:104248:133"/>Gracious men doe not alwayes hold out the ſame gracious frame of ſpirit.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was a time when <hi>Job</hi> was far from ſtriving with God, far from doing or ſpeaking any thing which had the leaſt ſhadow or ſavour of it. Time was, when <hi>Job</hi> was altogether for, and in ſubmitting to God; Let God doe what he will with him, he had not a word to ſay againſt him. After all the ſad reports and meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages which were brought to him of the devaſtation of his whole eſtate in the field, yea of the diſaſterous death of all his children in one day, and at once; did <hi>Job</hi> ſtrive with God? did he utter one word of complaint, or ſo much as of any diſſatiſfaction? No, not one, but gave Glory by this confeſſion; <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> Was not here a cleare yeilding of himſelfe up to God, to doe what he would with him? Did he not freely lay himſelfe low, when God had layed him at the loweſt? who ever heard or read of a more perfect worke of patience in a meere mortall man? Yet in the proceſs of the buſineſs, <hi>Job</hi> did not only ſpeak ſuch words as carried a ſhadow of ſtriving with God, but were reall ſtrivings and uncomely pleadings with him. His heart did not retaine that firſt ſweet ſubmiſſive frame throughout the affliction, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to admiration at the beginning of it. The ſtate of grace abideth alwayes, 'tis not (as ſome affirme) loſeable; 'tis not, like the beſt things of this world periſhing. But though a ſtate of Grace abideth alwayes, yet every mans grace (if any mans) doth not alwayes abide in the ſame ſtate. A true frame of grace ſhall never be deſtroyed, but the heart of a gracious man doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes continue in the ſame frame. The heate of grace may be cooled, the hight of it abated, the ſtrength of it weakned, and the beauty of it faded. He that a while agoe walked and acted very humbly, may upon another temptation act very proudly, and walke as if he were above all his brethren. He that one while hath act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very ſelf-denyingly, may at another time act very ſelf-ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. He that hath acted very lovingly, (the very law of love being ſtamped upon his words and workes) may at another time act very unlovely and loveleſly, and doe things which are very much beſide and below, yea contrary to the fulfilling of that roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Law; He may be ſo far from bearing his brothers burden,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:104248:134"/> (which is the fulfilling of that law of Chriſt, <hi>Gal:</hi> 6.2.) that he may be a burden to his brother. And while at one time you might have done and ſpoken almoſt what you would to him, and he could beare it, at another time, doe what you can, or ſpeake what you can, he is offended. Such changes and varieties are found upon the moſt gracious frames of ſpirit, which the beſt of Saints have in this world: We have only this to hold to, the ſtate of grace is unchangeable, and we are waiting for ſuch a frame of grace as ſhall never change. That gracious frame in which the hand of God will ſet us up in the day of our reſurrection to glory, ſhall never change, nor decline a haires breadth to all eternity. We ſhall be as pure, and as holy, and as ſpirituall, and as heavenly, and as meeke, and as full of the praiſe of God for ever, as ever. As full to eternity as in the very firſt moment in which that glorious frame ſhall be ſet up. But in this life to how great a degree of grace ſoever we attaine, we ſeldome retaine the ſame degree, but are flowing and ebbing like the water, waxing and waining like the Moone. <hi>Job</hi> was ſound ſtriving with God, who a little before had ſo humbly ſubmitted and was ſo fully reſigned unto him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>There is a ſpirit in man very apt to ſtrive with God.</q>
                  <p>Doe ye thinke (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam:</hi> 4.5.) that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith in vaine, <hi>The ſpirit that dwelleth in us, luſteth to envie,</hi> or (as the margin hath it) <hi>enviouſly;</hi> ſurely no; the Scripture doth not ſpeake this in vaine, and if any thinke it doth, their thoughts are vaine. Now, as there are luſtings in men to envie againſt their brethren, becauſe of the gifts and good things of God which they enjoy; ſo there are luſtings in men to diſcontent againſt God, becauſe of the evills which themſelves ſuffer. When God ſeemes to contend with us, we really fall to contending with God. The waters of <hi>Meribah</hi> will be an everlaſting wineſs of this; of which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayd (<hi>Numb:</hi> 20.13.) <hi>This is the water of Meribah, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the children of Iſrael ſtrove with the Lord, and he was ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in them.</hi> The Apoſtle doth more then intimate this readineſs of man to ſtrive with God, while by a vehement expoſtulation he checks it, and reproves all men for it. (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 10.22.) <hi>Doe we provoke the Lord to jealouſie? are we ſtronger then he?</hi> They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:104248:134"/> much upon their ſtrength, who are forward to ſtrive, they eſpecially who provoke and challenge others to ſtrive with them. There is a ſpirit in man which ſtouts it with God, even to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of ſtrife with him.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, When may we be ſayd to ſtrive with God? I anſwer, we doe it theſe foure wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Man ſtriveth with God by diſobeying his commands; that's a ſtrife with his holineſs. The lawes of God beare the image or ſtampe of his holineſs. All diſobedience is an unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableneſs to the Law, wilfull diſobedience is a making voyd the Law. He that is reſolved to ſin, wiſheth there were no Law to ſtop him from ſinning, or to puniſh him when he hath ſinned. What greater ſtrife can be raiſed againſt the Law-giver, then to wiſh he had given no ſuch Law?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Men ſtrive with God, by not believing or diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his promiſes. That's a ſtrife with his faithfulneſs, or with his power. Unbeliefe is one of the worſt wayes, if not the worſt of all the wayes of ſtriving with God. The reaſon why that place at the rock in <hi>Horeb</hi> was called <hi>Meribah</hi> (Exod: 17.7.) was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the people did not believe. They thought they muſt dye with thirſt in the wilderneſs when they ſaw no water. They fell to this ſin againe a ſecond time upon the like occaſion, while they abode in <hi>Kadeſh</hi> (Numb: 20.1, 2, 3.) And as the people ſtrove there with God by their rebellious unbeliefe, ſo alſo did <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> by their unbeliefe, that God would give water to ſuch rebells, as it follows in the ſame Chapter (<hi>v.</hi> 10, 11, 12.) There is no ſin ſo often, or ſo properly called a provocation as unbeliefe is. Yea by unbeliefe we ſtrive ſo much with God, that we are ſayd to weary him (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 7.13.) O how doe they weary God, who either thinke him ſo weake that he cannot, or ſo unfaithfull that he will not make good his word, or performe his promiſes! The firſt of theſe is alwayes in unbeliefe, the latter often.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We ſtrive with God by not bearing his hand, or by our impatience under the croſs which his hand layeth upon us: while we quarrell with the rod, we quarrell with God who cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteneth us with it. This was the moſt ſpeciall way in which <hi>Job</hi> ſtrove with God; and the ſinfulneſs of it, hath been ſeverall times toucht upon in this booke.</p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:104248:135"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, any murmuring word about, yea any diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented thought with our owne condition, though not vented by words, though it be kept in, and lye cloſe in the boſome, is a ſtriving with God. And ſo likewiſe is any tumultuating thought about his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences towards others, and his ſtating of affaires in the world.</p>
                  <p>Now as there is ſuch a ſinfull principle in man to ſtrive with God; ſo conſidering, as hath been ſhewed, how many wayes it workes (and many more wayes of its working might be ſhewed, this, I ſay, being conſidered) we may be found ſtriving with God before we thinke of it, yea while we oppoſe the very thought of it. Therefore (as <hi>Gamaliel</hi> warned the <hi>Jewes,</hi> ſaying (<hi>Acts</hi> 5.39.) <hi>Take heed what ye doe, leſt haply ye be found even to fight againſt God;</hi> Thoſe <hi>Jewes</hi> did not thinke their oppoſing the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers and Miniſters of Chriſt, was a fighting againſt God; But <hi>Gamaliel</hi> told them plainely it was. So in many other caſes, we may do &amp; ſay that which brings us under the ſame charge of ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with or againſt God, though we have no purpoſe (as <hi>Job</hi> had not) to ſtrive with him.</p>
                  <p>Againe, As this text ſheweth us <hi>Job</hi> ſtriving with God, ſo it ſheweth us <hi>Elihu</hi> ſtriving with or queſtioning <hi>Job</hi> about it. This queſtion or expoſtulation, <hi>Why doſt thou ſtrive with him?</hi> was a chideing ſevere reproofe of him for doing ſo.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>For man to ſtrive with God is moſt uncomely.</q>
                  <p>Doth it ſuite the condition, or become the ſtate of man to doe ſo? it doth not become man as a creature to ſtrive with God, much leſſe as a new creature, as a profeſſed ſervant of God, as a Saint, as a Chriſtian. We never act ſo unlike either creatures, or new creatures, Saints, and Chriſtians, as when we ſtrive with God. 'Tis a ſhame for a childe to ſtrive with his father, or for a ſervant to ſtrive with his Maſter, how much more for a creature to ſtrive with his Creator, man with God?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The rebuke which <hi>Elihu</hi> gave <hi>Job,</hi> did not only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the uncomelineſſe of his ſtriving with God, but the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>To ſtrive with God (in any of thoſe wayes before deſcribed) is a ſin exceeding ſinfull.</q>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:104248:135"/>
                  <p>How extreamly ſinfull it is for man to ſtrive with God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by all the relative duties of man to God: Every ſervant and ſon of God, is bound, firſt, to ſubmit to God; is it not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſinfull to ſtrive where we ought to ſubmit? Secondly, Every godly man by theſe relations to God, is bound to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with (which is more then barely to ſubmit to) all his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; Doe not they ſin, who in ſtead of being content, ſtrive with God becauſe he deales ſo with them? Thirdly, Man ought, not only to be content, but to be well-pleaſed with what God doth; How farre are they departed from a well-pleaſedneſſe with God, who ſtrive againſt him, which is an act of high diſpleaſure? It is ſayd of <hi>David</hi> (2 Sam: 3.36.) <hi>Whatſoever the King did pleaſed all the people.</hi> The people did not ſay to <hi>David</hi> their King, doe what you will, we will be pleaſed with it; But <hi>David</hi> was ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Prince, ſo good a King, that he did nothing that was juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſing to the people. 'Tis more then comes to the ſhare of a man, though a King to ſay, Let him doe what he will, we will be pleaſed with it, but 'tis certainly our duty to ſay to God, Doe what you will, doe your pleaſure with us, and to us, we will (through grace) be pleaſed with it. Is it not very ſinfull to ſtrive with him about any thing he doth, in and with all whoſe doing we ought to acquieſſe, and be well pleaſed?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Theſe words, <hi>Why dost thou ſtrive with him?</hi> import a high preſumption in thoſe who doe ſo.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Striving with God is a preſumptuous ſin.</q>
                  <p>The Prophet ſaith, (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 45.9.) <hi>Woe unto him that ſtriveth with his maker. Let the potſherd ſtrive with the potſherds of the earth: Shall the clay ſay to him that faſhioneth it, what makeſt thou? or thy work he hath no hands?</hi> When the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Let the potſherd ſtrive with the potſherds of the earth;</hi> his meaning is, let man ſtrive with man, but let not any man preſume to ſtrive with his maker; for then the potſherd ſtriveth with the potter. In all which he doth not encourage man to ſtrive with man, (though his match) but ſheweth how inſufferable a boldneſs it is for any man (how matchleſſe ſoever among men) to ſtrive with God. The King of <hi>Judah</hi> having ſent a challenge to the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> He returned this anſwer (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.9.) <hi>The thiſtle
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:104248:136"/> that was in Lebanon ſent to the Cedar that was in Lebanon,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſayd, What a preſumption is it for a thiſtle to equall it ſelfe with a Cedar? and therefore he adviſeth (<hi>v.</hi> 10.) <hi>Thou haſt indeed ſmitten Edom, and thy heart hath lifted thee up: glory of this and tarry at home; for why ſhouldeſt thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou ſhouldeſt fall, thou and Judah with thee?</hi> As if he had ſayd, thou canſt get nothing by medling with me but blowes, and moſt probably, thine owne ruine to boote. Now if an earthly King ſhall look upon it as a preſumption for another King his equall in dignity to contend with him, how much more may the God of heaven, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, count it an high preſumption for any man, though the greateſt King on earth, to ſtrive with him?</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, We uſe to ſay to thoſe who act fooliſhly, Why doe you thus? And therefore when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith to <hi>Job, Why doſt thou ſtrive againſt him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We learne.</p>
                  <q>Striving with God is a fooliſh and a most irrationall thing.</q>
                  <p>Sinners are fooles, all ſin is folly, irrationallity is ſtampt upon every ſin. Striving with God is a ſin ſo eminently fooliſh as may carry away the bell, for fooliſhneſſe, from all other ſins. I will give you three things, to ſhew why it muſt needs be ſo.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We cannot helpe our ſelves by ſtriving with God. Chriſt argues the folly of inordinate cares from this ground (<hi>Math:</hi> 6.27.) <hi>Which of you by taking thought can adde one cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit unto his ſtature?</hi> It is not mans care, but the preſence and bleſſing of God which encreaſeth both the ſtature of man and his eſtate. Cares may breake our ſleepe, yea breake our hearts, but they cannot fill our purſes, nor heighten our perſons, either in a naturall or in a civill notion. Is it not then a fooliſh thing to take inordinate care? is it not greater folly to ſtrive with God? Seeing as by caring you cannot get any of the good things of the world, ſo by ſtriving with God, you cannot get off any of thoſe evills which he layeth upon you. Secondly, Is it not a very foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh thing to ſtrive with God, ſeeing we are ſo farre from helping our ſelves out of trouble by it, that we doe but increaſe our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the more entangle our ſelves by it? What doe we by ſtrugling but ſtraiten the bonds of our affliction, and get weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:104248:136"/> in ſtead of expected eaſe? till we are quiet with God, how can we hope that he ſhould ſend us quietneſs? Thirdly, It is a fooliſh thing to ſtrive with God, becauſe by ſtriving with him in reference to any miſery that is upon us, we hinder our ſelves from taking comfort in any remaining mercy. Though God takes away many mercies, yet while life remaineth there is ſomewhat of mercy remaining. When <hi>Job</hi> was ſtripped to his skin, yet he had ſomewhat left, which was a ground of his bleſſing God. The greateſt looſers have ſomewhat left, they eſcape at leaſt (as <hi>Job</hi> ſayd he did at worſt, <hi>Chap:</hi> 19.20.) <hi>with the skin of their teeth.</hi> But while we ſtrive with God about the mercies we have loſt, we looſe the comfort of all the mercies we ſtill enjoy. And is it not extreame folly to deprive our ſelves of what we have by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining about what we have not? <hi>Why dost thou ſtrive?</hi> Thus much from the emphaſis of the former part of the verſe, as 'tis put into a chideing or reproving queſtion, <hi>Why doſt thou ſtrive againſt him?</hi> From the latter branch.</p>
                  <q>He giveth not account of any of his matters.</q>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The power and dominion of God is abſolute.</q>
                  <p>God is not ſubject to any reckonings with man whatſoever he doth. He that may doe what he will, and can doe nothing but what is right, neither may nor can be brought to any account for what he hath done. He that is unaccountable is abſolute in power.</p>
                  <p>Further, God needs not give man any account, upon theſe three grounds. Firſt, He oweth no man any thing; He hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived nothing of us, and if a man hath not received, he needeth not account. They that have any truſt from men, are to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But what hath God received from man? Man receives his all from God. Why then ſhould God give any account?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider, the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d hath wronged no man, nor can he. He is infinitely juſt and righteous in all his wayes; He not only doth juſt things, but things are juſt becauſe he doth them. Why ſhould he give an account of any of his matters, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth nor can doe any matter which is un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uſt. If we knew and were fully aſſured of a man (in whoſe hands we have truſted
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:104248:137"/> much) that he were ſo juſt, that he would not (though he had opportunity) deceive us of a farthing, we would never call him to an account. As it is ſayd of thoſe treaſurers in the ſtory of the Kings (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.15.) <hi>They reckoned not with the men into whoſe hand they delivered the money to be beſtowed on workmen, for they dealt faithfully.</hi> An example hardly to be parallel'd in an age by the ſons of men. Many are more deſirous of truſts, then carefull to diſcharge them; They love to have much treaſure paſſe through their hands, that ſome of it may, in paſſage, ſlip into their owne pockets and purſes. Juſtice and faithfulneſs are rare Jewels among men, and therefore it is but need they ſhould have a check upon them, and be called to an account. But the holy God is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſt and faithfull, therefore to what purpoſe ſhould he be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to an account. Let us reſt quiet in this acknowledgement, That he whoſe will is the higheſt reaſon, can doe nothing without reaſon. Man was created under God, and then he returnes to the order of his creation, when he prefers the judgement of God, even when he doth not underſtand it, before his owne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is no man, no nor Angel, that hath any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to call God to an account. They that are accountable to others,<note place="margin">Homo ſub deo eſt conditus &amp; ad conditionis ordinem redit, quando ſibi ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitatem judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, etiam quam non intelligit anteponit. <hi>Greg l. 13. Mor: c. 18.</hi>
                     </note> are under their power, either as being in degree above them, or as having made a compact &amp; covenant with them (though their equalls) to give them an account. But who ſhall call God to an account, who is higher then the higheſt? And though God hath condiſcended to make a covenant with man, and therein given him aſſurance that he will doe him good, yet God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelfe to give us an account how or in what way he makes good or performes his Covenant. Man muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to God how he hath performed the Articles of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, not God to man. As man is a fraile dying creature, ſo he is an accountable creature (<hi>Luke</hi> 16.2.) <hi>Give an account of thy Stewardſhip, for thou mayſt be no longer Steward</hi> (Rom: 14.12.) <hi>So then every one of us ſhall give an account of himſelfe to God.</hi> God will call every man to a ſtrict account of his receits and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, what talents of time and opportunities of parts and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of power and Authorities, have been put into his hand, as alſo how he hath husbanded and improved them. We, alas poore creatures, by ſtriving with God, call him (upon the matter) to give us an account of his matters; And in the meane time forget
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:104248:137"/> the account which we muſt give to him of all our matters. It is our duty and will be our wiſdome to account ſo with our ſelves every day, that we may be ready for our account in that Great and laſt Audit-Day; And as to remember &amp; prepare for our own account in that day, will keepe us from doing or ſaying any thing which may be interpreted a calling of God to an account all our dayes: ſo that remembrance will make us ſtrive how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and be bettered by the afflictions and troubles wherewith we are exerciſed in the world, in ſtead of ſtriving with God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he puts us upon thoſe ſeverer exerciſes; for how we have improved our afflictions will be one part (and that a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable one) of our account to God in that day.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The two parts of this verſe connected and conſidered together, <hi>(Why doſt thou ſtrive againſt him, for he giveth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any of his matters)</hi> The latter being a reaſon of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, give us this Obſervation.</p>
                  <q>God being abſolute in power we ought to ſit down quietly under all his dealings: <hi>Or thus,</hi> The conſideration of Gods abſolute Soveraignty, that he gives not account of any of his matters, ſhould ſtop all our ſtrivings and pleadings with or againſt God.</q>
                  <p>Our ſtrivings againſt God are of two ſorts, or in a double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; They reſpect either our eternall, or our temporall eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, With reſpect to our eternall ſtate (for about that we are apt to call God to account.) O what ſtrivings are there in the hearts of men about Gods abſolute ſoveraignty in electing of ſome and rejecting of others. The Apoſtle is much upon it (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.) where having repreſented the Lord ſpeaking thus by <hi>Moſes (verſ.</hi> 15.) <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compaſſion on whom I will have compaſſion:</hi> He preſently prevents an Objection, or the ſtrife of man with God about that ſaying, (<hi>verſ.</hi> 19.) <hi>Thou wilt ſay then, why doth he yet find fault?</hi> (As if men might find fault with God, if he in that caſe ſhould find fault with them?) <hi>for who hath reſisted his will?</hi> This is mans plea againſt the ſoveraigne will of God. But what ſaith the Lord by the Apoſtle to ſuch a pleader? we have his reproof of him for an anſwer in the next verſe, <hi>Nay but O man, who art thou that replyeſt againſt God? ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:104248:138"/> formed it, why haſt thou made me thus? hath not the Potter power over the clay?</hi> The Apoſtle brings in this Argument as to mans eternall ſtate; he muſt not ſtrive with God about that. He muſt not ſay, why doth God find fault with man? <hi>O man, who art thou that doſt logick it thus with God?</hi> His abſolute power is his reaſon why he diſpoſeth thus or thus of thee, or any man elſe. He will give thee no account why it is ſo, but his own will to have it ſo. For ſhame ſit downe, ſtop thy mouth for ever, ſpeak not thus to God. If thou art, as thou canſt not deny, a thing formed by God, then ſay not why haſt thou made me thus? And as now thou ſtriveſt with God about that which thou canſt not underſtand, ſo at laſt (though now thou doſt not) thou ſhalt underſtand that thou oughteſt not to have ſtriven with him about it. And indeed if men have a mind to ſtrive with God, they may find as many occaſions for it in the doctrine of his conditionall decrees of foreſeene faith, repentance, and perſevering obedience, as in his abſolute. We ſhall never want matter of quarrelling with God, till we have learned ſimply, that is, graciouſly to ſubmit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This truth ſhould much more quiet our ſpirits, and ſtop our ſtrivings in reference to our temporall eſtate. And that,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As wrapt up in common with others. Did we conſider the ſoveraigne power of God in ordering the affairs of Nations and Churches, we would glorifie him in a gracious ſilence how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we ſee things goe with them. The Scripture urgeth us often to this fixedneſſe of mind in the midſt of all publick revolutions and changes upon this only account. Heare <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 46.9, 10.) <hi>Come behold the works of the Lord,</hi> (What works? ruining works) <hi>what deſolation he hath made in the earth.</hi> God made ſtrange work in the World at that time, Thoſe countryes which before were as the Garden of God, became like a deſolate Wilderneſſe; who was able to beare this with patience? Yet the Spirit of God ſaith in the next words, it muſt be patiently borne; when God lets men ſtrive and warre with one another to a common confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet no man may ſtrive with God about it; and the reaſon giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en why no man may, is only this (which is indeed all the reaſon in the world) <hi>He is God.</hi> So it follows in the Pſalme, <hi>Be ſtill and know that I am God;</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, not a word, do not ſtrive nor reply, whatever you ſee, hold your peace; know that I being God I give no account of any of my matters. Thus the Prophet
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:104248:138"/> cautions the whole world (<hi>Zech.</hi> 2.13.) <hi>Be ſilent O all fleſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord,</hi> (doe not diſpute the doings of God, doe not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure at them) <hi>for he is raiſed up out of his holy habitation.</hi> That is, God is going to work (as a man raiſed out of his bed is) therefore doe not you trouble your ſelves, nor riſe up againſt him in your words or thoughts what work ſoever he makes. Like coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell is given (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.5.) <hi>Lift not up your horne on high,, ſpeak not with a ſtiffe neck; for promotion cometh neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South: But God is the Judge, he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth down one, and ſetteth up another.</hi> All great changes proceed from his judgment; take heed of judging the ſentence of the great Judge. Remember, <hi>That he whoſe name alone is Jehovah, is the moſt high over all the earth.</hi> (Pſal. 83.18.)</p>
                  <p>Againe, This is as true if we reſpect the private or perſonall eſtate of any man. If God makes a man poor in eſtate or deſpiſed in the World; if he make him ſick or weak in body, he muſt not ſay unquietly, why doth God thus? If he taketh away our Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if he empty our families we muſt not ſtrive with him. When old <hi>Ely</hi> had received one of the ſaddeſt meſſages that ever was ſent man. <hi>It is the Lord</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>let him doe what ſeemeth him good</hi> (1 Sam. 3.18.) So <hi>David</hi> (Pſal. 39.9.) <hi>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, becauſe thou didſt it</hi> (Pſal. 62.1.) <hi>Truly my ſoul waiteth patiently upon God.</hi> The word is, <hi>my ſoul is ſilent before God.</hi> And (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.5.) How doth <hi>David</hi> chide his ſoul for making a noyſe? <hi>Why art thou diſquieted O my ſoul, hope thou in God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, May we not at all ſtrive? what ever God doth in the World, or with us, muſt we ſit downe under it, or reſt ſatisfied in it, and ſay nothing?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, we may and ought to be very ſenſible of all the dealings of God. But we muſt not be unquiet under any of them. It is one thing to feele the ſmart, and another thing to diſpute the rod. Some are under a kind of Stoicall ſtupidity; they doe not ſtrive with God, becauſe they doe not mind what God doth, they are not ſenſible. Others are ſtout, ſturdy, and proud ſpirited, they care not for the croſſe, they ſlight and deſpiſe rebukes. Thus or upon theſe grounds not to ſtrive with God is as bad, if not worſe then that ſtriving with him which this poynt diſſwades and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves. We may, yea we ought to take notice of every ſtroak we receive from God.</p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:104248:139"/>
                  <p>Secondly, As we ſhould be ſenſible of the hand of God at any time upon us, ſo we may pray for the removing of his hand; 'Tis not a ſinfull but a gracious act, to ſtrive with God by prayer for deliverance out of trouble.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A man under the Rod may uſe means to get it off, and free himſelfe from it, even while he is quiet under it. So then, the quietneſſe of mind in our afflicted condition here intended and preſſed, is oppoſed only, firſt, to fretting and repining. Secondly, to vexing and tumultuating. Thirdly, to diſtracting cares. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to deſponding fears. Fifthly, to killing ſorrows. Sixthly, to uncompoſedneſſe of ſpirit for our callings. Seventhly, to hard thoughts of God. Eighthly, to the uſing of any unlawfull meanes to help or reſcue our ſelves out of the hand of evill.</p>
                  <p>And that we may be preſerved from all theſe ſtrivings againſt God, and unquietneſſe of ſpirit under any of his ſaddeſt and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſpenſations, which will certainly run us upon ſome of, if not all thoſe eight moſt dangerous rocks, laſt mentioned, Let me lay down a few conſiderations, why we ſhould not ſtrive with God in ſuch a manner: And preſcribe ſome preſervatives to keep us at the greateſt diſtance from it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Conſider, to ſtrive with God diſhonours God and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens his glory; for hereby we call his wiſdome and goodneſſe, yea his truth and faithfulneſſe to us in queſtion. What can be done more diſhonourable to God then this? God reſented it as a great diſhonour, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did not <hi>ſanctifie him</hi> (that is, give glory to his name) <hi>before the children of Iſrael</hi> (Num: 20.12.) and therefore told them, <hi>Ye ſhall not bring the children of Iſrael into the land which I have given them.</hi> As if he had ſayd, Ye have not honoured me as ye ought in this thing, and therefore I will not honour you in that. But what is it, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did not ſanctifie God in? it was (ſaith the text) <hi>in not believing.</hi> And what is that (at beſt) but a ſtriving with God, as to the truth of his word and his faithfulneſſe in fulfilling it?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Such ſtriving with God hinders the exerciſe of grace, and ſtops the worke of the new creature. He that ſtriveth with God by way of murmuring, can never ſtrive with God by praying and believing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Such ſtrivings with God are the exerciſings of our luſts and corruptions. Then is the time for anger and diſcontent,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:104248:139"/> or any evill affection to come forth and act their part.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Striving with God is an argument that ſin hath much ſtrength in us, and that corruption hath got a mighty hand over us.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Striving with God layeth us open to all the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Satan, to all the fiery darts of the Devill. Our ſhield is gone, when once we ſtrive with God, who is our ſhield in all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans ſtrivings and aſſaults againſt us; And then we ſtand naked before that armed enemy.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Striving with God, doth at once unfit us for every good duty, and putteth us further off from every deſired mercy.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, and laſtly, Striving againſt God, makes man moſt like the Devill, who is the moſt unquiet and diſcontented crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the world, and is alwayes both ſtriving with God, and vexing at his owne condition. The devill's ſin at firſt was ſtriving with God, and 'tis the ſumme of all his actings and workings againſt man ever ſince. None reſemble the devill more lively then male-contents; and who are they but ſuch as ſtrive and ſtruggle againſt the afflictive providences of God.</p>
                  <p>Now for the preſerving and keeping of our hearts from this great, this complicated ſin, a ſin containing many ſins in it, and diſpoſing us to all ſin. Lay theſe things to heart.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, let us conſider our own nothingneſs in compariſon of God. God is all, and what are we? we are nothing, and ſhall we ſtrive with God? ſhall folly ſtrive againſt wiſdome, and weakneſſe againſt ſtrength? When the Prophet would comfort the people of God againſt the ſtrivings of the nations with them, he doth it upon this conſideration (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 40:17.) <hi>All nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him leſſe then nothing, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; To whom will ye compare him?</hi> And ſurely we may by the ſame argument, much more deterre all men from ſtriving with God. Shall ſingle perſons ſtrive againſt him, to whom not only they, but whole nations are nothing, yea and leſſe then nothing?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Doe we find our ſelves under a croſſe, or in a hard condition? remember we have deſerved no better. As we are nothing, ſo we have deſerved nothing. <hi>Jacob</hi> to keepe his ſpirit quiet in a time of great diſtreſſe confeſſed (<hi>Gen:</hi> 32.10.) <hi>Lord I am unworthy of the leaſt of thy mercies.</hi> As if he had ſayd, I have no reaſon to complaine, or be angry, to fret or vex at this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:104248:140"/> yea though thou ſhouldſt let the cloud of my brothers wrath breake upon me, and ſwallow me up, for what am I? If we conſider we have deſerved no good, we ſhall never ſtrive with God about any evill that befalls us; eſpecially, if we conſider</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That we are ill-deſerving, or ſuch as deſerve the greateſt evills. None of us ſuffer but what our owne ſin hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, yea ſin might have procured us ſoarer ſufferings. Every ſin hath a croſſe in the belly of it. And ſhall we ſtrive with God becauſe of our croſſes, when our ſins have made them?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Why ſhould we ſtrive with God about theſe things? are they worth the ſtriving with God about? ſurely they are not wotth the ſtriving with men about, much leſſe with God. If we were in the beſt outward eſtate that ever any man enjoyed in this world, yet we were not then got a ſtep beyond vanity (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 39.5.) <hi>Every man in his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity.</hi> Suppoſe God ſhould give you a blank, and bid you ſit downe and write what you would have as to your outward ſtate, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it upon you, yet in this beſt eſtate, you and your all are altogether vanity. And will ye ſtrive with God for taking a vaine thing from you? Will you be ſo much diſſatisfied for the taking away or want of that which could not ſatisfie you when you had it, nor can when you have it againe? If a man had all theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which he ſtrives for, they could not make him happy, why then ſhould he ſtrive becauſe they are removed from him? But as they are vanity, becauſe unable to ſatisfie when we have them, ſo they are vanity, becauſe of our uncertainty to hold them. Yea ſuppoſe we hold them as long as we can have them, it is but a while. And ſhall we ſtrive with God about looſing that which at longeſt we cannot keepe long? To be ſure theſe things are not neceſſary for us: Chriſt ſayd to <hi>Martha, There is one thing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> (Luke 10.42.) But a worldly comfort of any kind is not the nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>y thing which Chriſt there intends; And ſhall we ſtrive with God about unneceſſaries?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Know, afflictions are the portion of the people of God in this life. They are the corrections of a father, and there is no ſon but hath his correction, or may have it. And ſhall we ſtrive with God for ſending us our portion, our ſon-like, child-like portion?</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, I would ſay this to believers, Why will ye ſtrive
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:104248:140"/> with God about any of your afflictions? they are for your good and benefit. And will ye ſtrive with God, becauſe he is doing you good? let your afflictions be never ſo ſad, never ſo ſore, and to ſence never ſo bad, yet God is doing you good by them; be not angry with your owne good?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Why doe we ſtrive with God under our afflictions; He loveth us as much under affliction, as in a proſperous conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. God is tender to his in their troubles, and ſhall they be harſh to him, when he is ſo tender towards them? A parent that hath but nature, will tender his child moſt when ſick and weak, and will not God? Let us take heed we be not found ſtriving with, or having hard thoughts of God while the bowels of his moſt tender compaſſions are moving towards us.</p>
                  <p>To ſhut up this whole poynt. As Chriſt when he ſaw his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in danger to be carried away with the feare of man, ſaith to them (<hi>Luke</hi> 12.4, 5.) <hi>Be not afraid of them that can kill the body, and after that have no more that they can doe, But I will forewarne you, whom you ſhall feare; feare him, which after he hath killed hath power to caſt into hell, yea I ſay unto you, feare him.</hi> Now, as becauſe men are apt to feare, yea moſtly to feare that which they ſhould not, Chriſt ſheweth them whom to feare. So (as hath been ſhewed) becauſe men are very apt to ſtrive, but they commonly ſtrive with thoſe, and about thoſe things, which they ſhould not. Therefore I will tell you with whom and with what ye ſhould ſtrive. If ye will needs be ſtriving, pray</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Strive with the ſin in your owne boſomes, ſtrive with your owne luſts and corruptions. One of the great Goſpel du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which we are called to, is to mortifie our earthly members. To ſtrive with all inordinate affections, with pride, with envie, with love of the world, and with uncharitableneſſe to the death, is our duty, if ye will needs ſtrive, ſtrive with theſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If you will needs be ſtriving, then ſtrive with the ſins of others in a gracious and zealous manner, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did, who contended with the Nobles for their prophanation of the Sabbath, and their unlawfull marriages (<hi>Neh:</hi> 13.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25.) we ſhould ſtrive with on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ove with <hi>Baal,</hi> and was therefore ſirnamed <hi>Jerubbaal</hi> (Judg: 6.32.) So let us ſtrive with the corrupt practices, courſes, and cuſtomes of the times, we live
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:104248:141"/> in, not d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lly and comply with them as many doe. The Apoſtle ſaith. (<hi>Heb:</hi> 12.4.) <hi>Ye have not yet reſiſted unto blood, ſtriving againſt ſin.</hi> That is, either the ſin of others, or the ſin which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would force you to. Though we ſhould ſtrive againſt our owne ſins eſpecially, yet 'tis good to ſtrive againſt ſin in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we ſee it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If you will be ſtriving, then ſtrive with Satan, The Adverſary; <hi>Submit to God, and reſiſt the Devill,</hi> containe the whole duty of man, (<hi>James</hi> 4.7.) Our buſineſſe is not to ſtrive with God, but to ſubmit to him; And our buſineſſe is not to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Devill, but to ſtrive with him. How doe moſt run a contrary courſe? They reſiſt God, and ſubmit to the Devill. O ſad! Here's a threefold bleſſed ſtrife; Firſt, Strive with the luſts and corruptions of your owne hearts; Secondly, Strive with the ſins of others, and their ſollicitations of you to ſin: Thirdly, Strive with the Devill and his temptations. Doe not ſtrive with God, why ſhould we ſtrive with God at any time, or in any thing, whom at all times, and in all things, we ought to ſerve, honour and obey? So much of this chideing queſtion, in which <hi>Elihu</hi> reproves <hi>Job,</hi> and he had given but too much occaſion for it. <hi>Why doſt thou ſtrive with him, he giveth not account of any of his matters.</hi>

               <p>This 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe hath ſome difficulty in it; And though the croſſe and various thoughts of Interpreters about it have made it more difficult, yet there is one thing wherein all Center and agree; That, <hi>Elihu</hi> in this 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe and ſo forward propounds certaine wayes by which God is pleaſed to reveale and manifeſt himſelfe unto man. Firſt, to humble and bring man to a true ſence of himſelfe; Secondly, to worke in him an acknowledgement of his great goodneſſe and righteouſneſſe in all his dealings with the children of men. For having ſayd at the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>God gives not account of any of his matters;</hi> He is above all reckonings and dayes of Audit (having thus, I ſay, aſſerted the abſolute ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of God over man) he adds, to mittigate and allay the ſeeming ſeverity of this aſſertion, That although God be ſo high and great,<note place="margin">Deus nomini rationem red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere tenetur. Tanto tamen amore nos com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plectitur ut ſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius judicioru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuorum rationes aperire digne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, etſi id non ſemper obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vamus. <hi>Lavat:</hi>
                  </note> that he is not at all obliged to give any account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe or of his wayes to the creature, nor will allow any man to be ſo bold as to ſtrive with him about, or queſtion any of his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, yet he is pleaſed freely and graciouſly to condeſcend unto man many wayes; and not only once but often, not only often in one way, but by ſeverall wayes to give him cleare intimations what his will is, what he requires of him, and calls unto him for, if man had but will and underſtanding to perceive it; <hi>for he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth once, yea, twice, yet man perceiveth it not.</hi> So then, man hath no reaſon to complaine (as <hi>Job</hi> ſometimes had done, and many

                  </p>
                  <p>As if here a reaſon were given why God ſhould not be called at all (as being ſo great he ought not) to give man an account of any of his matters, <hi>for he ſpeaketh once or twice,</hi> he is aforehand with man.</p>

                  <p>To ſpeake, in ſtrict ſence, as ſpeaking is the forming up of words by an articulate voyce, is proper to man; yet in Scripture God is ſayd to ſpeake, when or howſoever he maketh knowne his mind to man. Which he alwayes doth in ſuch a way, as is moſt ſuitable to his owne greatneſſe, with reſpect to mans weakneſſe. When God giveth us any intimation of his owne will, and of our duty, of what he will doe for us, or of what he would have us doe,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:104248:142"/> then he is ſayd to ſpeake to us.

And though now God doth not ſpeake to us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately as he did to the Prophets before Chriſt came in the fleſh, and to the Apoſtles after he was come in the fleſh, yet All the Propheticall and Apoſtolicall writings are the ſpeakings of God to us, beſides what he dayly ſpeaketh to us (anſwerable to what is written) both inwardly by the workings of his Spirit, and outwardly by the workes of his providence. <hi>For he ſpeaketh once,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Every manifeſtation of the will of God to us is a Sermon; what, man ſpeaketh to us according to the word of God, is to be received as the word of God. For as God ſpeaketh to us, though not formally, yet expreſſely in the holy Scriptures, which are his word, ſo he ſpeaketh to us vertually, though not expreſſely by his works. And that, Firſt, by his workes of creation; by them God is continually opening and manifeſting himſelfe to man in his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power, and goodneſſe. He ſpeaketh to us, Secondly, by his works of providence, whether firſt they be works of mercy (every mercy hath a voyce in it, every bleſſing a ſpeech) or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, whether they be works of judgement (<hi>Micah</hi> 6.9.) <hi>The Lords voyce cryeth unto the Citie, and the man of wiſdome ſhall ſee thy name; heare ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</hi> Sickneſſes and loſſes, the croſſes and troubles that we meet with in the world, cry aloud to us, eſpecially when they make us (as they often doe) cry aloud. <hi>As the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy worke, day unto day uttereth ſpeech, and night unto night ſheweth knowledge</hi> (Pſal: 19.1, 2.) ſo thoſe things that are done and acted night and day, utter the

Thus the Apoſtle argueth (<hi>Heb:</hi> 6.17, 18.) <hi>God willing more abundantly</hi> (or more then needed as to him and the truth of the thing in it ſelf) <hi>to ſhew unto the heires of promiſe the immutability of his counſel confirmed it by an oath, that by two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable things, in which it is impoſſible for God to lye</hi> (namely, his promiſe and his oath) <hi>we might have ſtrong conſolation,</hi> &amp;c. In like notion we may expound that <hi>once,</hi> which we finde (<hi>Heb:</hi> 9.27.) <hi>And as it is appointed unto men once to die</hi> (or to dye once) <hi>and after that cometh the judgement.</hi> Some referre, <hi>once,</hi> to <hi>dye,</hi> as if the meaning were, it is appointed unto men to dye once, that is, men muſt expect to dye a naturall death, which happens but <hi>once,</hi> and <hi>once</hi> (at leaſt equivalently) will and muſt happen to all men.

This is a good ſence, and ſutable enough to the ſcope of <hi>Elihu;</hi> God ſpeaketh <hi>once,</hi> that is, what he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is a ſure and certain word, an infallible word; <hi>the word ſetled for ever in heaven</hi> (Pſal: 119.89.) his promiſe is not only ſure but moſt ſure. As the Apoſtle ſpeakes (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19.) <hi>And this voyce which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy Mount.

                     </note> notes the ſpeaking of a thing ſo <hi>ſufficiently or fully,</hi> that there is enough ſayd at once, and ſo no more needs be ſayd. The vulgar tranſlation takes up this ſence, <hi>God hath ſpoken once</hi> (that is, he hath ſpoken fully or ſufficiently for mans inſtruction and admonition at once, and therefore he tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates the latter part of the verſe, thus; <hi>And he doth not repeate it the ſecond time.</hi> That which is done at once ſufficiently, needs not be done a ſecond time; This is a truth; There is a ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and a fullneſſe in the word of God once ſpoken, there needs nothing to be added; or as others expound this tranſlation. When once God ſpeakes, that is, reſolves and determines a thing, he doth not (as man who often repents of what he hath purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) bring it into a ſecond conſideration, for he cannot erre, and therefore he needs decree but once. But though this be a truth, yet I doe not conceive it to be the meaning of this place, becauſe it doth not well agree with what goes before, and leſſe with that which followeth at the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>Loe all theſe things worketh God oftentimes,</hi> or (as our Margin hath it) <hi>twice and thrice with man.</hi> And therefore here <hi>Elihu</hi> rather intimates the variety of thoſe wayes by which God reveales himſelfe to man, then the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of any one of them. For though we grant any one of them ſufficient, yet God out of his abundant goodneſſe is pleaſed to reveale himſelfe more wayes then one, and more times then once.</p>

Thus when the Apoſtle had ſayd in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (Chap: 9.27.) <hi>It is appointed unto men once to dye, and after this the judgement,</hi> preſently he addeth, <hi>So Chriſt was once offered to beare the ſins of many;</hi> there alſo <hi>once</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>twice,</hi> or a ſecond time, excluding all repetition of the ſacrifice of Chriſt. As 'tis ſayd (<hi>Heb:</hi> 10.10.) <hi>By the which will we are ſanctified, through the offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all.</hi> And therefore the ſame Apoſtle in the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (<hi>v.</hi> 26.) terrifieth Apoſtates with this dreadfull doome; <hi>If we ſin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſins;</hi> that is, neither will Chriſt give up himſelfe to be a ſacrifice againe for ſuch as have (after light received about it, and ſome ſeeming cloſings with it) caſt off that his ſacrifice, nor can any other ſacrifice be given. In this ſence alſo ſometimes God ſpeakes, <hi>once,</hi> He ſpeakes <hi>once</hi> and will ſpeake no more, <hi>once</hi> and not a ſecond time; though we have a <hi>twice</hi> here in the text, yet, I ſay, in ſome caſes and unto ſome perſons, God ſpeaketh once and will not ſpeake againe. Whence take this obſervation or Admonition rather.</p>
                  <q>It is dangerous refuſing the firſt call, the firſt Word of God. Poſſibly, you may never heare more of him or from him, once may be all.</q>
                  <p>God may ſpeak in thy caſe, not only <hi>once,</hi> that is firmly and certainly, not only <hi>once</hi> that is ſufficiently, but once (that is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, once) and no more for ever. That moving caution of the Apoſtle is grounded upon ſuch a ſad poſſibillity as this (<hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7.) <hi>Wherefore as the holy Ghoſt ſaith, to day if ye will heare his voyce, harden not your hearts;</hi> and again (<hi>verſ.</hi> 13.) <hi>Exhort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dayly, while it is called, to day, leſt any of you be hardened through the deceitfullneſſe of ſin.</hi> As if it had been ſaid; heare to day, hear this hour of the day, for you know not, firſt, whether there will be a morrow or another day for you; ſecondly, if you have a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, yet you know not whether you ſhall have a word to morrow; both time and ſeaſon, dayes and opportunities are in the hand of God; and he that neglects the ſeaſon of one day, hath no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of another day, much leſſe of a ſeaſon with the day.

That which the Lord ſpake of affliction, to ſhew the fullneſſe of it, may alſo be fullfilled concerning his warnings and admonitions (<hi>Nahum</hi> 1.9.) <hi>I will make an utter end, affliction ſhall not riſe up the ſecond time:</hi> We ſhould hear at firſt ſpeaking, leſt it ſhould prove that when the Lord hath ſpoken once, he ſhould make an utter end, and ſay, inſtruction and admonition ſhall not riſe up a ſecond time. And to be ſure, as <hi>Abraham</hi> after he had interceded for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> ſeverall times, ſaid at laſt (<hi>Gen.</hi> 18.32.) <hi>O let not the Lord he angry, and I will ſpeak yet but this once.</hi> So the Lord when he hath ſpoken oft to ſinners and is not heard growes ſo angry, that he comes at laſt and ſaith, I will ſpeak yet but this once. God will at laſt come to his, <hi>but once</hi> more to all men; and with ſome he is at his once at firſt and no more for ever. There is a time when every man ſhall hear his laſt word, and God will ſpeak but that once; and ſomtimes it is but once in all that God will ſpeak. Therefore take heed, it is dangerous deferrings if God ſpeaks once, if he call &amp; knock once, it is our ſin &amp; folly too, that we doe not hearken to, and open at his firſt call and knock, though the Lord doth (I grant) uſually and moſtly exerciſe much patience towards ſinners, calling and knocking once and againe, as it followeth in the text, <hi>He ſpeaketh once,</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, conſider <hi>twice</hi> as to number; twice ſtrictly taken is more then once. One is no number, but two is.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>God is ſo gracious that he ſpeaks once and againe, once and a ſecond time to ſinners.</q>
                  <p>Who is there among us that hath not had experience of Gods ſpeaking to him more then once? And that not only with reſpect to the various wayes of ſpeaking, but with reſpect to various times of ſpeaking. He ſpeakes more then once by his word, more then once by his workes, whether of judgment, or of mercy. Some ſinners are conſumed in a moment or at once, (as it is ſaid of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> with their confederates (<hi>Numb.</hi> 16.21.) others dye of a lingring conſumption. God waiteth to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and therefore he rarely ſpeaketh his all or ſtriketh his all at once. He gives precept upon precept, line upon line, he ſends ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row upon ſorrow, croſſe upon croſſe, that ſinners may at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member themſelves, returne and live.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As twice notes a number, ſo it may be conſidered as a ſmall number, yea as the ſmalleſt number; twice or two is the firſt number, the firſt ſtep into number. They that doe a thing more then once cannot do it leſſe then twice, nor can that number which is more then one be leſſe then two. When the woman in the book of <hi>Kings</hi> told the Prophet (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.12.) <hi>I am going to gather two ſticks.</hi> Her meaning was, a very few ſticks, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye now to make a little fire to bake a Cake with. And when the Spirit of God would ſhew how few, comparatively to the rout of the World, they are and will be that bear witneſſe to the truths of Jeſus Chriſt, he calleth them two Witneſſes (<hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3.) they are a number, yet expreſt by the leſt number, that we ſhould not have our eyes upon the multitude, or think, that is not the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:104248:145"/> truth which is not followed by great numbers, or the moſt of the World. The traine of Chriſt is not large, nor are his wayes throng'd, few there be that find them. As they whom he calls forth to be eminently his witneſſes are not many, therefore called <hi>two;</hi> ſo they that receive their witneſſe are not many; <hi>The world wonders after the beaſt.</hi> Thus as two or twice imply a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; ſo in Scripture language, that which is done more then twice is ſuppoſed done often or many times (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.10.) When the Prophet had told the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> where the forces of the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> would come, and by that meanes defeated him of his purpoſe; it is ſaid, <hi>And the King of Iſrael ſent unto the place which the man of God told him, and warned him of, and ſaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf there, not once, nor twice;</hi> that is, many times, which made the King of <hi>Syria</hi> wonder how it came to paſſe that he was ſo often defeated; he thought he had laid his plots ſo wiſely and cloſely that the King of Iſrael could not eſcape, but he ſaved himſelf not once, nor twice; more then twice is many, but bare twice is the narroweſt compaſſe of number imaginable.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>God hath not given us any ground to preſume upon frequent warnings or ſpeakings.</q>
                  <p>Though he ſpeake more then once, yet it may be but twice, poſſibly but twice preciſely, probably but twice reſtrainedly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. The Lord would not have us build upon the hope of future ſpeakings, to the neglect of what is preſently ſpoken. Though God be very patient and long-ſuffering to ſinfull men, yet he hath not given any man, the leaſt occaſion, no not by a promiſe of ſpeaking a ſecond day, to continue one day much leſſe to continue long in ſin. When God ſpake (as I may ſay) at the largeſt rate of his patience to ſinners, he ſayd (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3.) <hi>My ſpirit ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſtrive with man; not alwayes,</hi> that is, though it ſtrive long, yet it ſhall not ſtrive very long, and that he may know it, I will give him a day, <hi>yet his dayes ſhall be an hundred and twenty yeares.</hi> This was ſomewhat a long day indeed; But remember this hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty yeares, was all the time that was granted to all the men of that world, there was not ſo much granted to every particular man of that world, poſſibly the Spirit of God did not ſtrive a day longer with many a one among them. Therefore take
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:104248:146"/> heed of preſuming. When the Lord ſpeaketh once, doe not ſay, I will ſtay till he ſpeakes a ſecond time, and if he condeſcend to ſpeake twice, doe not believe that he will alwayes ſpeake.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Twice,</hi> may be conſidered as a ſmall certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, put for a ſmall uncertaine number. 'Tis frequent in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to put a certaine number of any kinde, for an uncertaine; Sometimes a certaine great number, for an uncertaine great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and ſometimes a ſmall certaine number, for a ſmall uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine number. As twice is not to be tyed up ſtrictly to the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt number; ſo not to any number whether ſmall or great.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>No man knows how oft he ſhall be warned or ſpoken unto by God.</q>
                  <p>God doth not put an abſolute ſtint upon any of his actions. Beware of neglecting the leaſt twice, the firſt twice, which is the loweſt twice; for though we cannot binde God up ſtrictly to twice, it may prove three times or foure times, yet whether it ſhall be ſo many, or how many it ſhall be, no man nor Angel knoweth. Twice cannot be very often, and 'tis uncertaine how often. Therefore if you hearken not when God hath ſpoken once (take it ſtrictly) doe not ſtop your eares at the ſecond ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is ſayd, <hi>Moſes ſmote the rock twice</hi> (that was twice beyond his Commiſſion, for he ſhould not have ſmitten it at all) <hi>and the mater came out aboundantly.</hi> How many rocks, that is, hard hearts, hath God ſmitten by his word and his workes twice, and yet we ſee not the waters of Godly ſorrow flowing out; the rocks are ſmitten more then twice with the rod of God, with the rod of his mouth in the miniſtery of his word, they are ſmitten with admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon admonition, with reproofe upon reproofe, with threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon threatning, and yet the waters came not out aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, yea ſcarce at all. May not they feare that they ſhall have poenall ſorrow upon ſorrow (<hi>Paul</hi> tooke notice of the goodneſſe of God to him, that he did not let him have afflictive ſorrow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſorrow (<hi>Phil:</hi> 2.27.) but, I ſay, may not they feare they ſhall have poenall ſorrow upon ſorrow) that is, everlaſting floods of ſorrow, who after the Lords ſpeaking upon ſpeaking, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon reproving, give no proofe of their godly p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>enitentiall ſorrow? O how angry was the Lord with <hi>Solomon, becauſe his heart was turned from the Lord God of Iſrael, which had appeared
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:104248:146"/> to him twice</hi> (1 Kings 11.9.) God appeared to him in <hi>Gibeon</hi> (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.5.) when he was firſt made King, putting him to his choice, or giving him a blanke to aske what he would, and he choſe well, he choſe wiſdome and had it. God appeared to him a ſecond time after the building and dedication of the Temple (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.2.) <hi>And ſaid unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and thy ſupplication, that thou hast made before me,</hi> &amp;c. Thus the Lord appeared ſolemnly unto <hi>Solomon</hi> twice, and but twice for any thing that appeares upon record in that ſolemne manner. Now when notwithſtanding theſe two appearings of the Lord to <hi>Solomon,</hi> the heart of <hi>Solomon</hi> was turned away from the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael, his anger was kindled againſt Solomon,</hi> and the Lord ſmote him once, yea twice, renting his kingdome, and pulling away ten tribes at once, from his ſon and ſucceſſor. O doe not refuſe God ſpeaking to you twice, or the renewed ſpeaking of God; to doe ſo is very ſinfull, and therefore very dangerous. For as 'tis a ſigne of a holy heart, of a gracious frame of ſpirit, to heare twice at once ſpeaking; as <hi>David</hi> profeſſed he did (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 62.11.) <hi>God hath ſpoken once, twice have I heard this, that power belongeth unto God: alſo unto thee O Lord belongeth mercy.</hi> There are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rendrings and interpretations of thoſe words; But that which to me ſeemes moſt intended by our rendring is, I heard what was once ſpoken twice at once, that is, I heard it ſpeedily, and I heard it believingly; as ſoon as ever the word came to me I received it, and I received it not only with my eare, but with my heart. That's a bleſſed way of hearing, and they who heare ſo, at firſt ſpeaking, may well be ſayd to heare that twice which God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth once. But how ſad is it that God ſhould ſpeake twice, thrice, yea foure times, and yet not be heard ſo much as once! When <hi>Job</hi> was brought upon his knees (<hi>Chap:</hi> 40.5.) he ſaid, <hi>Once have I ſpoken, but I will not anſwer: yea twice but I will proceed no further. Job</hi> began to be ſenſible of that which <hi>Elihu</hi> was work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to, that he had been too forward, yea too forward with God; <hi>Job</hi> began to ſee his error, and recanted it; <hi>I have ſpoken once, yea twice, but I will proceed no further.</hi> 'Tis good, that after once or twice ſinning or failing, we yet ſay we will proceed no further. O how deplorable is mans condition, when the Lord ſhall ſay, I have ſpoken once, yea twice, but now I will proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will ſpeake no more! And this uſually comes to paſſe,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:104248:147"/> when men are dull and ſlow of heart to underſtand what he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, which as naturall men alwayes, ſo godly men often are, as it followeth in this text; <hi>He ſpeaketh once, yea twice,</hi>

                  <p>There is a little varietie in the expoſition of this latter clauſe of the verſe; The word <hi>man</hi> not being expreſſely in the Hebrew (and therefore we finde it put by our tranſlaters in a diſtinct character) the text runs only thus; <hi>God ſpeaketh once, yea twice, he perceiveth it not.</hi> This hath occaſion'd the vulgar latine inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter to referre this laſt clauſe of the verſe to God alſo; giving out the ſence thus; <hi>God ſpeaketh once, and a ſecond time he doth not repeate it;</hi>

                     </note> yet, there is a ſecond rendring of the text in the ſame te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, giving a genuine ſence of that word, which is very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and proper enough to the ſcope of the place, <hi>God ſpeaketh once, and he doth not conſider upon it a ſecond time;</hi> That is, when God ſpeaks or decrees to give forth any thing, he doth not take it into conſideration againe or review and bring it about upon ſecond thoughts, as men often doe; yea it is their duty (though it be a duty ariſing from their frailty) ſo to doe. Men ought to conſider often and review their owne words as well as their works. But (ſaith <hi>Elihu,</hi> according to this reading) <hi>God ſpeaks once, and doth not conſider of it againe;</hi> for he hath the meaſure and compaſſe of all things ſo fully in himſelfe, that he needs not turne backe his thoughts upon any of his determinations, as if there could be a miſtake, or any error in them. This is a very glorious truth, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advancing the name of God above every name among the beſt of the children of men. And it ariſeth clearely from the text, leaving out the ſuppliment which we make of the word <hi>man.</hi> Yet according to the opinion of the moſt and beſt expoſiters, yea according to the cleareſt ſcope and tendency of the text, that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:104248:147"/> word <hi>man</hi> is rather to be ſupplyed, <hi>God ſpeaketh once, yea twice,</hi>

                     </gap>ng about ſpirituall things.</q>
                  <p>The propheticall Sermons are called viſions; <hi>The viſion of Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:104248:148"/> the ſon of Amos, which he ſaw</hi> (Iſa. 1.1.) yet when they preached them to the people, many of them ſaw nothing; their viſions were to the people as parables or darke ſayings. Man in generall falls under a twofold conſideration; firſt, as unconverted or carnall; and in that ſtate he perceiveth not at all, when God ſpeaks once and twice, yea thrice, he perceiveth nothing. And that proceeds from a double ground.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from the naturall pravity of his heart, and the blindneſſe of his mind. Of ſuch the Apoſtle ſaith (<hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18.) <hi>They have their underſtanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſſe of their heart.</hi> And hence he concludes (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.) <hi>The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe to him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſcerned;</hi> ſpirituall objects muſt have a ſpirituall eye to ſee them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this comes to paſſe ſometimes from the judgment of God upon carnall men; who as in mercy he cauſeth the blind to ſee, ſo in wrath he ſtriketh thoſe that have no mind to ſee with greater blindneſſe, and puniſheth their former rebellion and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy againſt the word received with an impotency to perceive it. Yea God doth not only leave ſuch in the blindneſſe of their mind and dullneſſe of their underſtanding, but gives them up to it. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was a Goſpel Preacher, he held out the light clearly, yet his hearers were under ſuch a doome, that the very light which he held out blinded them; ſo that the more he ſpake the leſſe they perceived (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.10.) <hi>And he ſaid, go and tell this people, hear ye indeed, but underſtand not; and ſee ye indeed, but perceive not: make the heart of this people fat, and make their eares heavy, and ſhut their eyes; leſt they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their eares, and underſtand with their hearts, and convert, and be healed.</hi> This is a dreadfull Scripture; The Lord is highly provoked indeed, when he judicially ſhuts up the eyes of men, and hardens their hearts againſt his own meſſages, not that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth any hardneſs or inſtilleth any ignorance into them; but gives them up to that ignorance hardneſſe and darkneſſe which already poſſeſſeth them. And then though God ſpeak once or twice, or a hundred times, they perceive it not: They that harden their hearts, ſhall have them hardened by that which is the ordinary
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:104248:148"/> meanes to ſoften and melt them; and they that ſhut their eyes againſt any truth, are in danger of having them ſhut againſt all truth, even by that means which uſually openeth eyes. Thus we ſee that this firſt ſort of men, meere carnall men, cannot ſee ot perceive when God ſpeaketh, and why it is ſo.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, (which I conceive rather to be the meaning of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi> here) Man may be conſidered in his ſpirituall ſtate. That is, as converted and renewed in ſpirit, by the mighty working of the Spirit. Now to men in this eſtate God ſpeakes once, yea twice, <hi>and they perceive it not.</hi> They that are ſpirituall doe not alwayes perceive ſpirituall things. For</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they have much corruption in them. Though they are renewed, yet they are renewed but in part; we ſee in part and but darkly, yea ſometimes Saints can hardly ſee at all, eſpecially as to ſome diſpenſations and manifeſtations of God! he may ſpeak once, yea twice and thrice to them in ſuch a thing, or to ſuch a purpoſe, and they take little or no notice of it. He may poynt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by ſuch providences, and by ſuch Sermons, and yet they look upon themſelves as un-concerned, not making any home-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of what they outwardly hear or ſee, yea feele and ſmart under; and all this by reaſon of ſome prevailing corruption.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this may proceed from their negligence and ſlothfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; good men are not alwayes carefull as they ſhould, much leſſe criticall and wiſely curious to obſerve every providence of God, and to conſider why or for what end ſuch or ſuch a word is ſent to them. As carnall men thruſt the word from them, ſo godly men faile much at all times, and at ſome times wholly neglect to lay the word to heart. They doe not compare themſelves, that is, their lives and conſciences; their thoughts and wayes with the word, and then no wonder if they perceive not what is ſpoken to them. Even a <hi>Job</hi> may be hindred by his own indulgence from perceiving what God ſaith unto him. The Prophet complained of the people of God for not ſtriving to take hold of him. (Iſa. 64.7.) <hi>There is none that calleth upon thy name, that ſtirreth up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to take hold on thee.</hi> And may we not complaine that few ſtirre up themſelves either to take hold of the word of God, or that the word may take hold of them? <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted <hi>Timothy</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.) <hi>to ſtir up the Gift of God that was in him.</hi> They that have received both gifts and grace may be much wanting to themſelves
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:104248:149"/> in ſtirring them up. Though we deny mans naturall power, yet perſons converted have a ſpirituall power, which they often neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to ſtir up. When the ſervants of <hi>Benhadad</hi> (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.32, 33.) came to <hi>Ahab</hi> upon that meſſage to beg his life, it is ſaid, <hi>The men did dilligently obſerve whether any thing would come from him</hi> that they might take hold of, and urge it in favour of their Maſter; and as ſoon as <hi>Ahab</hi> had dropt that word, <hi>he is my Brother,</hi> as ſoon as they had that word, <hi>they did haſtily catch it</hi> and applyed it for their preſent purpoſe. So they that are godly ſhould obſerve what is ſpoken unto them, what corruption is ſmitten by the word or by the rod of God, and as ſoone as ever ſuch a word is ſpoken, they ſhould take it up and apply it to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thoſe many luſts that are in the heart of a godly man, not yet fully mortified, as ſecret pride, ſelf-love, and unbelief, theſe hinder him from underſtanding the mind of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are counſelled by the Apoſtle <hi>James (Chap.</hi> 1.21.) <hi>to lay aſide</hi> (that is, to get ſubdued and mortified) <hi>all filthineſſe and ſuperfluity of naughtineſſe, and</hi> (ſo) <hi>receive with meekneſs the engraffed word which is able to ſave our ſouls.</hi> As if he had ſaid, we can neither perceive nor receive the word ſavingly, unleſſe our luſts are caſt out and caſt off. How much any man neglects this duty of mortifying his luſts, by ſo much is he rendred both unable to perceive the word, and unfit to profit by it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> renders the words thus, <hi>God ſpeaks once, yea twice, and man will not mark it.</hi> We ſay, <hi>man perceiveth it not;</hi> he ſaith, <hi>man will not mark it.</hi> As our reading ſhews the weakneſs and imperfections, or the negligence and ſlothfullneſſe of man, when he doth not perceive what God ſpeaketh; ſo his ſheweth the obſtinacy of man. The will of man is as perverſe, as his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is blind. Man hath not only a wound or a weakneſſe in his will unto that which is good, but he hath a rebellion in his will againſt that which is good, and that not by ſome occaſionall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt or ſudden guſt of paſſion, but he is naturally ſet and reſolved againſt that which is good. <hi>Man will not mark</hi> what God ſpeaketh in his word and works. Chriſt upbraids the <hi>Jews (Joh.</hi> 5.40.) <hi>Ye will not come unto me that ye may have life;</hi> he chargeth the fault upon their wills. 'Tis certaine <hi>man hath a will not to come to Chriſt for life;</hi> yet that is a forced and farre fetcht inference which ſome make from it, <hi>that man</hi> hath therefore power and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:104248:149"/> 
                     <hi>will to come.</hi> Sure enough man hath a will not to come, he hath not only an inabillity, but an enmity and an oppoſition in his will againſt Chriſt: he will not come to Chriſt that he may be ſaved, but would take up his ſalvation ſomewhere elſe; he would be his own Saviour, or let any one ſave him, rather then be ſaved by Chriſt; all things conſidered, eſpecially this, that he muſt deny himſelf, and neither be found truſting to his own righteouſneſſe, nor acting any unrighteouſneſſe, if he deſires to be ſaved by Chriſt. And as there is a reſiſtance in the will of man againſt the true diſpenſation of Goſpell grace; ſo againſt any other diſpenſation whereby God ſpeaketh to him. The unchanged will of man riſeth up againſt the will of God manifeſted in his works, as much as againſt his will manifeſted in his word (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.11.) <hi>Lord, when thy hand is lifted up they will not ſee.</hi> If his hand be lifted up in publick judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they will not ſee it, if in family or perſonall judgments and afflictions they will not ſee it, but ſhut their eyes and hoodwink their own underſtandings. Yea, they are oftentimes ſo wilfully, or rather ſo madly blind, that they had rather ſay it is the hand of <hi>blind Fortune,</hi> then the hand of the Allmighty and All-ſeeing God. <hi>Now who is ſo blind as they that will not ſee?</hi> Till this rebellion againſt the holy will of God with which the will of man is filled be caſt out and ſubdued, let him ſpeake once, yea twice, let him ſpeake by word or works, by promiſes or by threatnings, by good or evill, yet man will not mark it. Thus much in generall of Gods revealing himſelf to man; In the next words we have the diſtinct wayes ſet downe by and in which he revealeth himſelf: <hi>In a dreame &amp;c.</hi>

When it is ſayd that God came to <hi>Abimelech (Gen:</hi> 20. and to <hi>Laban</hi> Gen: 31.) and an Angel of the Lord to <hi>Joſeph</hi> (Math: 1.) ſpeaking to them in dreames, they had ſuch things exhibited to and impreſſed upon them, as gave the former two aſſurance that God ſpake to them, and the third that he was ſpoken to by an Angel of God.</p>
                  <p>Further, We may diſtinguiſh of dreames; Firſt, ſome are meere naturall dreames; and they ariſe foure wayes; Firſt, from the temperature of the body, Melancholly and flegmaticke perſons, have their ſpeciall dreames, and ſo have men of a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine and of a cholericke complection. The firſt encline to dreame of ſad, the ſecond of ſottiſh, the third of pleaſant things, and the laſt of wrathfull wranglings and contendings. Secondly, Naturall dreames are cauſed by the diet or food which we eate, ſpeciall meate inclining to ſpeciall thoughts and imaginations. Thirdly, Meere naturall dreams flow from the buiſineſs or ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all worke wherein we have been ingaged in the day; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes (<hi>Eccleſ:</hi> 5.3.) <hi>a dreame cometh thorow the multitude of buiſineſs;</hi> that is, a man dreams at night of what he hath been do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:104248:151"/> in the day. Fourthly, Naturall dreames ariſe from vehement affections to or deſires of what we want, and would have. Thus (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 29.7.) <hi>The hungry man dreams he eats, and the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty man dreams he drinks;</hi> For being pincht with hunger, and parcht with thirſt, his appetite is not only ſtrong, but fierce and violent after meat and drinke. Theſe and ſuch like are naturall dreams. I call them ſo becauſe the riſe or reaſon of them is ſeated in nature, and they are ſuch as have no other cauſe but what is common and naturall to man. Nature let alone or left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch outward accidents will produce ſuch dreames.</p>
                  <p>Seconldy, There are diabolicall dreams; the devill knows how to ſtirre the humors and worke upon the phantaſies of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men. Satan is skilfull and diligent in ſolliciting our luſts and corruptions both day and night, and they being once ſollicited or moved to worke, cannot but worke in us both ſleeping and waking. Yea the devill can inſpire falſe doctrines and opinions by dreames, as well as provoke to wicked practiſes. Of ſuch dreamers we read (<hi>Deut:</hi> 13.1, 3.) <hi>If there be among you a falſe Prophet, or a dreamer of dreames.</hi> Falſe Prophets had many dreams (<hi>Jer:</hi> 23.25.) Such were wont to ſay, <hi>I have dreamed, I have dreamed.</hi> Becauſe the holy Prophets had their dreams from God, the Devill would give his unholy Prophets dreams too, which were lies and vanity, deceits and errours, leading them out of the way of God, whether we reſpect truth of doctrine, or purity of worſhip. We may reduce all diabolicall dreames to theſe two heads; They are either, Firſt, falſe dreames, that is, dreames of falſhood, for he is the father and former of lyes; or, Secondly, they are filthy defiling dreames; for he is an uncleane ſpirit, and the feweller of all filthy fires and uncleanneſſes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corporall or ſpirituall.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There are <hi>divine dreames,</hi> ſo called, Firſt, becauſe immediately ſent by God; Secondly, becauſe the ſubject matter of them is divine and heavenly, or ſome manifeſtation of the holy will of God to man. There are five ſpeciall Meſſages upon which dreames are ſent from God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To reprove or admoniſh; Thus God dealt with <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi> in a dreame, that he ſhould not meddle with <hi>Sarah (Gen:</hi> 20.3.) and with <hi>Laban,</hi> that he ſhould not hurt <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor hinder him in his journey back to his fathers houſe (<hi>Gen:</hi> 31.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:104248:151"/> 24.) whereupon <hi>Jacob</hi> told him, <hi>God rebuked thee yeſter night.</hi> That dream of <hi>Pilates</hi> wife (<hi>Math:</hi> 27.19.) was ſent to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Pilate</hi> about giving Judgement againſt Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God ſends dreams to inſtruct, and informe; There are teaching dreams, that of <hi>Joſeph</hi> (Math: 1.21.) was not only to ſhew him what to doe about <hi>Mary</hi> his eſpouſed wife, but to inſtruct him about that Great myſtery of God manifeſted in the fleſh, to ſave loſt man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Dreams are ſent for ſupport and conſolation in a time of trouble (<hi>Gen:</hi> 28.12.) God comforted <hi>Jacob</hi> by that dream, when he was in a deſolate condition, and aſſured him of his preſence.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Some dreams are ſent of God upon a ſad meſſage to afflict and terrifie; <hi>Job</hi> bemoaned his ſufferings and ſorrows by ſuch dreames (<hi>Chap:</hi> 7.13, 14.) <hi>When I ſay my bed ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me, my couch ſhall eaſe my complaint, then thou ſcareſt me with dreames, and terrifieſt me with viſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, God foreſheweth what ſhall come to paſſe, he reveals his own counſels, as to future providences, by dreames and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The ſeven years of famine were revealed to <hi>Pharoah</hi> in a dreame. And the great things of the Church, and of the world too, were revealed to <hi>Daniel</hi> in a dreame, and in viſions of his head upon his bed (<hi>Dan:</hi> 7.1.) The meſſage of the dreame in the text was for inſtruction and admonition, as will appeare at the ſixteenth verſe; God ſpeaketh <hi>in a dream;</hi> and further
<q>In a viſion of the night.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some take <hi>viſion</hi> here as a ſecond way of divine revelation. And 'tis true, the Scripture ſpeakes of dreams and viſions diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (<hi>Numb:</hi> 12.6.) Others make viſions to be only appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to dreams; For though there have been viſions without dreams, yet dreams are ſeldome, if at all, without ſome kind of viſion. This ſeemes the intendment of this text, <hi>In a dream, in a viſion of the night;</hi> That is, in a dream with a viſion of the night, as making the viſion to be nothing elſe, but either a repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the matter dreamed of, or of the manner wherein it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the dreamer. And I conceive, that <hi>Elihu</hi> in this verſe is ſpeaking only of one, not of two wayes of Gods revealing himſelfe to man; or rather of one then two. Yet whether we
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:104248:152"/> take the viſion diſtinctly from or joyntly with the dream, the ſcope of <hi>Elihu</hi> in this text is equally anſwered and fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>Further, <hi>Elihu</hi> doth not only report the way of Gods diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering himſelfe, that is, in a dream, in a viſion, but he declares the time or ſeaſon of theſe dreams and viſions, or of theſe viſions in a dream; that is, <hi>the night,</hi> and the night conſidered under this diviſion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>When deep ſleep falleth upon men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, When they have their <hi>ſlumberings upon their bed;</hi> that is (as I apprehend) at the beginning of the night, and break of day (for thoſe are the ſlumbring times of the night) or in the middle of the night or midnight, for then uſually men are fallen into and abide in a deep ſleep, or as we render, Then
<q>Deep ſleep falleth upon men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some ſleeps, as we may ſay, are but ſhallow ſleeps, ſlight ſleeps, in compariſon of other; Deep ſleep is that which we call, Dead ſleep. The word here uſed by <hi>Elihu,</hi> notes the ſtrongeſt and the ſoundeſt ſleep, and therefore 'tis fitly diſtinguiſhed from <hi>ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berings upon the bed.</hi>
                  </p>

                     </note>There are three words in the Hebrew which ſignifie <hi>ſleep;</hi> whereof the firſt ſignifies <hi>ſleep</hi> in generall; the ſecond, <hi>deep ſleep;</hi> the third, any <hi>ſlight ſleep,</hi> which we here tranſlate <hi>ſlumbering.</hi> Ordinary ſleeping is more then ſlumbring, and a deep ſleep, more then ordinary ſleep; we commonly ſay, ſuch a man <hi>is faſt aſleep,</hi> he is, as it were, bound hand and foote.

                     </note> The words are a deſcription of the exact watchfulneſſe of God over his people, he that doth not ſo much <hi>as ſlumber,</hi> he that never lays his eyes together, he that doth not only not take a nap (as we ſay) but not ſo much as once nod (to ſo little the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew-word may be drawne downe, which is likewiſe the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Greek-word, he, I ſay, that doth not ſo much as
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:104248:152"/> nod) is farre from ſleepe, furtheſt of all from deep ſleep. In both theſe degrees of ſleep, the Lord ſpeakes by Dreames, firſt, <hi>in deep ſleep;</hi> Secondly, <hi>in ſlumbrings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some conceive that <hi>Elihu</hi> intended by theſe different words, to ſet forth two ſorts of dreams; Firſt, thoſe dreams which men have when extraordinary deep ſleep falls upon them; ſuch as that ſpoken of (<hi>Gen:</hi> 2.21.) <hi>God commanded a deep ſleep to fall on Adam,</hi> when he tooke the rib out of his ſide and formed the woman. We read alſo (<hi>Gen:</hi> 15.12.) that a deep ſleep fell on <hi>Abraham</hi> when God revealed to him what ſhould become of his poſterity, and how they ſhould be in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and there much oppreſſed foure hundred yeares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is ſaid alſo (1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 26.12.) <hi>A deep ſleep from the Lord was fallen upon them;</hi> that is, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Saul,</hi> and his guards, who lay round about him. And that might be called a ſleep from the Lord, both becauſe it was a ſleep which the Lord ſent, and becauſe it was an extream deep ſleep. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, there are dreams in ordinary ſleep, or in very ſlumbrings or noddings upon the bed, we may call them waking dreames. Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> ſheweth God taking ſeverall times or ſeaſons for the revealing of himſelfe in dreams; ſometimes in deep ſleep, and often in the leaſt and ſlighteſt ſleeps, called ſlumbrings.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not here inſiſt upon or diſcourſe the way of Gods mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting himſelfe to the Ancienrs, by dreams &amp; viſions, but referre the Reader to what hath already been done upon the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſes; where <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeaks almoſt in the ſame manner as <hi>Elihu</hi> here about viſions; And, indeed there is a very great Conſent between their two parts in this booke, that of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> and this of <hi>Elihu;</hi> They were both holy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall men, both of them had the ſame deſigne in ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout dreams and viſions, namely, to convince and humble <hi>Job;</hi> and both of them expreſſe themſelves in terms of a very neere Cognation. So that if the reader pleaſe to conſult that place (<hi>Job</hi> 4.12, 13.) he will find theſe words farther cleared, as to the nature and ſeverall kinds of viſions. And if he turne to what hath been done upon the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, he may find the doctrine of dreams further opened.</p>
                  <p>Only let me adde here a note or two.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It hath been the uſe of God to reveale his mind by dreams.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:104248:153"/>
                  <p>And I may give you five reaſons why God uſed to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to man in dreams: Firſt, becauſe in ſleep man is, as I may ſay, at beſt leiſure for God to deal with him; he is not diſtracted with buſineſſe, nor hurried with the labours of this life, but is at reſt. Secondly, when we are awake we are very ready to debate and diſcuſſe what we receive by our own reaſon, we are ready to Logick it with God; but in ſleep we take things barely as offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without diſcuſſions or diſputes. Thirdly, in ſleepe when all is quiet, that which God repreſents, takes and leaves a deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the mind of man. Common experience teacheth us how dreams ſtick, and how thoſe apprehenſions which we have in our ſleep dwell &amp; abide with us when awake. Fourthly, I conceive the Lord doth this chiefly that he may ſhew his divine skill in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching &amp; inſtructing man, or that he hath a peculiar art in teaching; he teaches ſo, as none of the maſters of learning were ever able to teach and inſtruct their Schollars. There was never any man could teach another when he was aſleep; they that are taught muſt at leſt be awake, yea they muſt not only be awake but watchfull; but now God is ſuch a teacher, ſuch an inſtructor, that when we are aſleep he can convay inſtruction and teach us his leſſons; this (I ſay) doth wonderfully magnifie the divine skill and power of God, who is able to make us heare and underſtand doctrine even when we are aſleep and cannot heare. There may be alſo a fifth conſideration moving God to this. Poſſibly God would hereby aſſure us, that the ſoul is a diſtinct eſſence, and hath its diſtinct operations from the body; and that even death it ſelf cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the ſoul of man of its working. For what is ſleep but a kind of death? <hi>ſleep is a ſhort death, and death is along ſleepe.</hi> Now when the body is (upon the matter) laid aſide, the ſoul can goe to work; when the body lyes like a block and ſtirs not, the ſoul can beſtir it ſelf about many matters, and run its thoughts to the utmoſt ends of the earth, yea and raiſe them up to the higheſt heavens, in bleſſed intercourſes with God himſelf. There's no need to prove the matter of fact that 'tis ſo; what night, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to ſome or other, doth not utter this poynt of knowledg? nor need I ſtay to prove that this is, if not a demonſtrative, yet a very probable argument of the diſtinct ſubſtantiallity of the ſoul from the body, namely its operations when the body (with all its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and peculiar faculties and powers) is a ſleepe, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:104248:153"/> nothing to thoſe operations. For though it be granted that ſome irrationall creatures (who have no immortall part, nor any thing ſubſtantiall in them diſtinct from their bodies, though it be granted I ſay, that theſe) may have dreames; yet their dreams differ as much from thoſe of men, as themſelves doe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly Note,
<q>The revelation of the mind of God by dreams and viſions, was much, yea moſt uſed in thoſe ancient times. When God had not ſo fully revealed his mind by Scripture or his mind in the Scripture, then he ſpake often in dreams and viſions; <hi>and hence the old Prophets were called ſeers.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle reports, God ſpeaking at ſundry times, and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers manners in times paſt, unto the fathers by the Prophets, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1.) The Greek text hath two very ſignificant words,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,</note> the former moſt properly implying how God gave out his mind in divers meaſures, or how he parcelled it out, the other implying the ſeverall wayes in which he gave it out. As the meaſures were various, ſometimes more ſometimes leſſe of his mind about di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine matters and myſteries being diſperſed, ſo the wayes manners and formes of this diſpenſation were very various; yet the moſt uſuall way was by dreams and viſions (<hi>Numb.</hi> 12.6.) <hi>If there be a Prophet among you</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>I the Lord will make my ſelf known unto him in a viſion, and ſpeak to him in a dreame.</hi> Yea we find that in the firſt dayes of the Goſpel, dreames and viſions were frequent. The Apoſtle falling into a trance had a viſion (<hi>Acts</hi> 10.10.) <hi>He ſaw heaven opened and a certain veſſell deſcend, &amp;c.</hi> And when Chriſt would have the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Goſpell into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> a viſion appeared to him in the night (<hi>Acts</hi> 16.9.) <hi>There ſtood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, ſaying, come over to Macedonia and help us.</hi> The ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.1, 2.) <hi>I will come to viſions and revelations of the Lord, whether in the body I cannot tell, or out of the body I cannot tell. Pauls</hi> ſoul was wrapt up in ſuch high and intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes with God, that he even forgot how it was with his body, or had little to doe with it. Which ſuites well with that deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> gave of himſelf, when he had the whole mind of God concerning the ſtate of his Church to the end of the world, revealed to him in ſeverall viſions, <hi>I</hi> (ſaith he <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10.)
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:104248:154"/> 
                     <hi>was in the ſpirit on the Lords day,</hi> &amp;c. That's is a famous promiſe, which was firſt reported by the Prophet <hi>Joel (Chap:</hi> 2.28.) and after repeated by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter (Acts</hi> 2.17.) <hi>I will poure out my Spirit upon all fleſh, &amp;c. and your young men ſhall ſee viſions, and your old men ſhall dream dreams.</hi> Thus it is every where clear in Scripture, that dreames and viſions were frequent both in the Old Teſtament times, and in the beginning of the New;</p>
                  <p>But now <hi>in theſe laſt dayes</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2, 3. paſſing from thoſe former wayes of Revelation deſcribed in the firſt verſe) <hi>God having ſpoken to us by his Son, whom he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed heir of all things, by whom alſo he made the Worlds, who is [alſo] the brightneſſe of his glory, and the expreſſe Image of his perſon: God I ſay having ſpoken to us by his Son,</hi> and we having now a clearer manifeſtation of the mind of God then the old fathers had, the Son who once ſpake to us in perſon on earth, ſtill ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us in the Goſpell every day; therefore now for any to look after dreams and viſions, or viſible apparitions for the revealing of the mind of God, is to goe backward to the old ſtate of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Church, or to the infancy of the Goſpell Church, while the Canon or Rule of the Scripture as to all matters of faith and holy life was not fully finiſhed and compleated. And though we ought to be farre from limiting God, yet he hath limited us from looking after any wiſdome in the knowledge of his will above that which is written (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6.) The Apoſtle alſo teſtifying by the Spirit of God, that the Scripture is ſufficient to <hi>make every man wiſe to ſalvation and the man of God perfect, throughly furniſhed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all good works</hi> (that good work eſpecially of helping others to ſalvation) 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.17.</p>

Secondly; that he would nor ſend him dreames or viſions, yea, ſaith he, I even contracted with God that he would not. And doubtleſſe he did this upon a double ground. Firſt, to oppoſe the wild opinions and practices of thoſe, who had nothing to pretend for them but dreames and viſions. Secondly, to advance the honour of the written word in its ſufficiency, not
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:104248:154"/> only without the help of any humane tradition, but without any further divine revelation. And therefore though God ſhould pleaſe to ſpeak to us now by dreames and viſions, yet that were only (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks about his adding of an oath to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17.) to ſhew that he is <hi>(ex abundanti)</hi> more abundantly willing to ſatisfie our weakneſſe by ſuch a condiſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then that there is a neceſſity of it, with reſpect to any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of the Scriptures fullneſſe. And hence it is, that if men ſhall profeſſe they have received any thing from God by dreams or viſions, concerning what is either to be beleeved or done, the matter of thoſe dreams muſt be examined and weighed at the ballance of the Scriptures, and is no further to be credited then as 'tis found agreeable thereunto.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be denyed but that men may make profitable uſe of their dreames at this day; they may ſee much of themſelves when their eyes are ſhut up by ſleepe. Evill men may ſee their luſts at worke in the night, and find out what luſt is moſt working and wakefull in them. What is ſaid in Hiſtory of the ancient Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Kings, that they were ſeldome ſeen in the day, but came to view in the night, is true of a mans ſpeciall ſin, or of that ſin which reignes and Kings it in him. What ugly apparitions of luſt hath many a man in his nightly dreams, eſpecially of thoſe filthy luſts which are moſt proper to the night? Thus alſo good men have ſometimes a clearer ſight of their graces in the night by dreames, then in the duties of the day. What holy frames of heart? what lively actings of grace? what ſweet and raviſhing communion with God have many godly men found and felt in dreames? That may at leſt, be ſomewhat of <hi>Davids</hi> meaning, when he ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.17.) <hi>My reines alſo inſtruct me in the night ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Though we cannot make any certaine concluſions, either what we are, or what we are to doe from dreames; yet from them they who are wiſe and watchfull may ſometimes gather ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures about both or either. To make dreames the rule or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what we doe is extreamly dangerous, yet that we may have hints what to do in a dreame, I nothing doubt, nor can there be any danger in it, while the matter hinted is conſonant to the rule of the word, both as that which is lawfull to be done, and lawfull for us (all circumſtances conſidered) to doe. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:104248:155"/> whatſoever we may think our ſelves warned or warranted to doe by dreames, is but a mock or trick put upon us by the Devill, or a deceit of our own fooliſh ſelfiſh hearts.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have ſeene the firſt way of Gods ſpeaking to men of old, <hi>by dreames and viſions of the night;</hi> what work God is pleaſed to make with and in man by ſuch ſpeakings, will appeare diſtinctly in the three following verſes.</p>

Secondly, internall, that power of hearing ſeated in the heart. God can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover or open both. There are but few who have their outward eare ſtopt, we rarely meet with a deaf man. But we every where meete with and ſpeak to thoſe who are internally deafe. The Lord openeth this inward eare, and he only is able to doe it. <hi>God opened the heart</hi> (or internall eare) <hi>of Lydia to attend to the things which were ſpoken of Paul</hi> (Acts 16.14.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Further, the Hebrew is (as we put in the Margin) <hi>He reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or uncovereth the eares of men.</hi> This revealing or uncovering of the eare, ſay ſome, noteth only private ſpeaking, and is a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude taken from a common cuſtome among men; who when they would convey their mind ſecretly to a friend that ſtands by, put their head near to his eare, and take up the brim of his hat, or put by his haire (if long) that they may whiſper in his eare. Thus in a dreame God whiſpers and ſpeaks ſilently unto men. This ſeems to have a ſutableneſſe with that (<hi>Chap.</hi> 4.12, 13.) where <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpake of a thing <hi>brought ſecretly to him,</hi> or that was whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered or ſtoln into him.

                     </note> he open'd the ear, yea, he gave an eare to hear: This powerfull work of God upon the heart is elegantly expreſſed by <hi>opening</hi> the eare, becauſe when the ears are ſtopt, we cannot hear, till that which ſtops them is pluckt out or taken away; ſo that here we have ſpeaking with effect, or the cleare and penetrating power of the Spirit of God ſweetly and prevailingly inſinuating his mind to man. God ſpeaks ſo as he will be heard.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The eare of man is naturally ſtopt againſt the teachings of God.</q>
                  <p>There are many things which ſtop the eares of man, or man hath many eare ſtoppers. I will name ſeven, all which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves and takes away when he effectually reveals his mind to man. Firſt, the eare of man is ſtopt with ignorance, that's a thick vaile or covering upon the eare, and keeps out the mind of God till it be removed. And, Secondly, Unbelief is another ear-ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; till the Lord removeth that we cannot hear. Thirdly, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency or hardneſſe of heart ſtops the eare, there are a number of Scriptures I might give for each of theſe. Fourthly, the love of any particular ſin is an eare-ſhutter or an eare-ſtopper, and the Lord removes that, when he opens the eare. Fifthly, Prejudices ſtop the eare, prejudices ſomtimes againſt the perſon ſpeaking, ſomtime againſt the word ſpoken. That man will never hear a word to purpoſe, who hath a prejudice againſt the perſon, or a prejudice againſt the word, either a prejudice againſt the man, or againſt the matter. Sixthly, Pride ſtops the eare too, the proud man will not hearken, therefore God humhles and brings down the ſpirit that the word may be heard. Seventhly, and laſtly, the World is a great ear-ſtopper, that locks up the eare againſt the word; the world in the profits of it, and the world in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of it, and the world in the cares of it, and the world in the fears of it, the world by or in every one of theſe ſtops the eare, and by theſe the ears of all men naturally are ſtopped, ſo that they are as it is ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.4.) <hi>like the deafe adder, that ſtops her eare, and will not hear the voyce of the charmer, charme he never ſo wiſely.</hi>
                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:104248:156"/> Till all theſe ſtoppers are removed, and the eare opened, there is no receiving of the word.</p>
                  <p>Secondly Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>God is able to open and unlock the eare of man.</q>
                  <p>Though it hath never ſo many ſtopples in it, he can pull them out, never ſo many locks upon it, though all the ſeven ſpoken of, and ſeven more obſtruct the ear, yet he can open them all, and make a free and uncontroulable paſſage for his word into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt and cloſeſt chambers of the ſoul. God can ſpeak loud enough, not only to make the deafe, but the dead hear his voyce. <hi>Verily; verily I ſay unto you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.25.) <hi>the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voyce of the Son of God: and they that hear ſhall live.</hi> By the dead he means not thoſe who are corporally, but ſpiritually dead, that is, dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, and in danger of eternall death for their ſins and treſpaſſes, even theſe heard the voyce of the Son of God then ſpeaking perſonally, and heard it afterwards miniſterially, in the diſpenſation of the Goſpell, and that voyce revived them, not only by giving them the comfort of that naturall life which they had before, but by bringing in a new ſpirituall life which before they had not. Then the internall eare is opened to purpoſe when thoſe internall or myſtically darke graves of ſin are opened, and the ſoul comes forth into the light of life.</p>
                  <p>Yet more diſtinctly. God may be ſaid to uncover or open the eares of men, when he doth theſe four things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When he makes us not only to heare but to attend, not only to heare but to hearken; or not only to heare but to give eare. <hi>Many give the word of God the hearing, but they doe not give eare to the word of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, God opens the ear when he makes us not only attend, but underſtand, or when he takes the vaile off from our minds. The Apoſtle ſaith of the <hi>Jewes</hi> (2 Cor: 3.14.) <hi>The vaile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth upon them untaken away to this day in the reading of the old Teſtament</hi> (and it doth ſo ſtill) ſo that as they could not, ſo yet they cannot, <hi>Looke to the end of that which is aboliſhed;</hi> that is, to Chriſt, who was the end or ſcope at which the whole Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law (now aboliſhed) did then ayme. When once the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re is divinely opened, then the vaile of ignorance and ſpirituall blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:104248:156"/> is taken off from the mind, both as to that greateſt truth, and all other neceſſary truths. The opened eare is an underſtanding eare.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God openeth the eare when he cauſeth us to believe what we perceive and underſtand. As faith ſets the whole ſoule aworke for God, ſo faith is the great worke of God upon the ſoule. When the eare is opened, truth is not only knowne, but ſavingly believed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This opening of the eare maketh the ſoule obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; Jeſus Chriſt in that great prophecy of him (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 40.6.) to ſhew his ready obedience to his fathers command, ſaith, <hi>Mine eare haſt thou opened</hi> (or digged) The eare of Chriſt was never ſhut in the leaſt, either through ignorance or unbeliefe; but he is ſayd to have his eare opened, only to ſhew his conſtant preparedneſs and readineſs for obedience. He came into the world with an open eare to all the will of God; and therefore it followeth in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſes of that Pſalme, <hi>Then ſaid I, loe I come, in the volume of thy booke it is written of me, I delight to doe thy will, O my God, yea thy law is within my heart.</hi> Chriſt is brought in by another Prophet ſpeaking to the ſame poynt with ſome little variety, but with very great ſignificancy of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 50.4, 5.) <hi>He wakeneth morning by morning, he wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth mine eare to heare as the learned;</hi> we uſually ſay, Sleep is in the eye, yet this prophecy intimates a ſleep in the eare, <hi>thou haſt wakened mine eare.</hi> What we are to underſtand by this wakened eare, is cleare in the next words of the ſame prophecy, <hi>The Lord hath opened mine eare,</hi> that's the word of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> and the conſequence of opening the eare, ſet downe in the Prophet, is the ſame now given in this poynt, <hi>The Lord hath opened mine eare, and I was not rebellious.</hi> He doth not ſay, The Lord ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mine eare, and I heard, but, <hi>I was not rebellious;</hi> that is, I gave up my ſelfe to obey the word or command, which I heard. The ſame Prophet (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 48.8.) deſcribing the rebellion of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> puts this as the reaſon of it, <hi>Yea thou heardeſt not,</hi> (that is, thou didſt not attend) <hi>yea thou kneweſt not,</hi> that is, thou didſt not underſtand, yea <hi>thine eare was not opened;</hi> as if he had ſayd, thine unopened eare was the cauſe why thou diddeſt neither attend, nor underſtand, nor obey the word ſpoken to thee. So much of the firſt gracious deſigne of God in ſpeaking to men by dreams
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:104248:157"/> and viſions of the night; <hi>Then he openeth the ears of men.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is given in the latter part of the verſe.</p>

                  <p>We may much more apply this to the wicked, to the ungodly and rebellious, who though they have their outward ears open, yet their hearts remain ſhut; If the correction of the godly be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in that caſe, to be ſure, the deſtruction of the wicked is; they are ſealed for death, yea they are ſealed for hell; the writ of their eternall Judgement is ſealed. <hi>If Judgement muſt begin at the houſe of God, where ſhall the ungodly and the ſinner appeare? what ſhall the end of them be that obey not the Goſpel of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, Take it as we render it, referring to inſtruction, <hi>He ſealeth their inſtruction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence note.</p>
                  <q>God is able to ſet home his inſtructions effectually upon the ſoule.</q>
                  <p>He can leave ſuch an impreſſion upon the heart, as as ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be forgotten nor worne out. He can make every word ſtick;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:104248:158"/> And ſo this is but a further illuſtration of what was ſaid before; he openeth their ears to receive the word, and then ſealeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon them. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of ſome perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, who were the fruit of his miniſtry, ſaith, <hi>Ye are the ſeale of mine Apoſtleſhip</hi> (1 Cor: 9.2, 3.) that is, ye confirme and ratifie my miniſtry, that it is of God, and that God is in it. Now as the converſion of ſinners, and the building up of Saints, is the ſeale of our miniſtry; ſo the ſealing of inſtruction upon the ſoule, is the converſion of ſinners, and the edification of Saints. When a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is converted, his inſtruction is ſealed upon him, and when a Saint is built up and edified, and increaſeth in the things of God, then inſtruction is ſealed upon him alſo. And untill we thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the word, we have the word, as I may ſay, without a ſeale, nothing faſtens upon us.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the firſt deſigne of God in ſending dreams and viſions in thoſe times, it was to open the ears of men, and to ſeale their Inſtruction; This being only a generall benefit aymed at by thoſe meanes, we have thoſe which are more ſpeciall ſet downe in the words which follow.</p>

                     <hi>or withdraw man from thoſe things which he hath done;</hi> that is, from thoſe evills to which he hath already ſet his hand; this is done by giving man repentance, which is our being humbled for, and turning away from any evill already committed.</p>
                  <p>Our tranſlation refers it to what is intended to be done, for that's <hi>a purpoſe.</hi> So the meaning is, God doth theſe things that he may keep man from doing that evill or miſchief which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon, or at leaſt is forming and hammering in his thoughts. <hi>Abimelech</hi> had an evill purpoſe for the matter (though poſſibly the purpoſe of his heart was not evill, for he ſaid to God (and God ſaid he ſpake true) <hi>in the integrity of my heart, and innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of my hands have I done this,</hi> Gen. 20.5, 6. (he was I ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an evill purpoſe for the matter) when he thought to take <hi>Abrams</hi> wife from him, but the Lord came to him in a dream, and withdrew him from the evill of his purpoſe. <hi>Laban</hi> intended evill, or hard dealing to <hi>Jacob,</hi> but the Lord met him alſo in a dreame, and withdrew him from his purpoſe, ſaying, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 31.24.) <hi>Take heed thou ſpeak not to Jacob, neither good nor bad,</hi> that is, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him not in his journey, either by threathings or by promiſes. Thus man is taken off or withdrawn from evill purpoſes by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting grace, and from evill workes by repenting grace.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall proſecute the words according to our reading only, which imports that when man hath ſome evill purpoſe upon his heart, the Lord viſits him in dreames and viſions of the night, to withdraw him from that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve Firſt,
<q>Man is very forward and eager upon evill purpoſes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God himſelf muſt come to withdraw and fetch him off, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:104248:159"/> he will be driving them on. The heart of man naturally hath no other purpoſes but evill purpoſes, and upon them it is ſet (as I may ſay) to purpoſe; that is, he will effect and bring them about if he can. When <hi>Moſes</hi> reproved <hi>Aaron</hi> concerning the golden Calfe which he had made, at the inſtance and violent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the people, <hi>Aaron</hi> anſwered for himſelf (<hi>Exod.</hi> 32.23.) <hi>Let not the anger of my Lord wax hot, thou knoweſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that they are ſet on miſchiefe,</hi> they are bent to it, they have ſuch a mind to it, that there's no turning them from it; they will hear no reaſon nor take any denyall, when the fit is on them. There is a ſetting of the heart of man continually upon evill; the wind blowes that way, and no other way, the wind ſits alwayes in that bad corner till God turneth it. There are two gracious acts of God, ſpoken of in Scripture, which doe exceedingly ſhew forth the ſinfullneſſe of man; every act of grace doth in its meaſure aggravate the ſinfullneſſe of man, and alwayes the higher grace acteth, the more is the ſinfullneſſe of man diſcovered, eſpecially (I ſay) in this twofold act of grace. The former whereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in <hi>drawing;</hi> the latter in <hi>withdrawing;</hi> there is a gracious act of God in drawing the ſinfull ſons and daughters of men to that which is good. Man is drawne, Firſt, into a ſtate of grace or goodneſſe, by this he is made good. He is drawn, Secondly, to acts of grace or goodneſſe, by this he doth good. Of the former Chriſt ſpeaks (<hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44.) <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him,</hi> that is, no man can beleeve, (for by faith we come to Chriſt) except he receive power from on high. God draweth the ſoul to Chriſt, and that's a powerfull act of divine drawing, though not a compulſory act: and as God muſt draw man into a ſtate of grace, which is our union with Chriſt by the Spirit in beleeving, ſo he draweth him to the acting of his graces. Of this latter the Church ſpeaketh to Chriſt (<hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4.) <hi>Draw me, and I will run after thee.</hi> Theſe gracious drawings ſhew that we are not only utterly unable, but averſe to the receiving grace, and ſo becoming good, while we are in a ſtate of nature; as alſo that we are very backward to doe that which is good, even when we are in a ſtate of grace. Now as God acts very graciouſly in drawing man to good, ſo Secondly, in withdrawing him from evill, from thoſe evill purpoſes and evill practices, to which all men are ſo eaſily yet ſo ſtrongly carried. The Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 2.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104248:160"/> 23, 24.) elegantly deſcribes the exceeding forwardneſſe of that people to evill, while he compareth them to <hi>the ſwift Dromodary, traverſing her wayes, and to the wild Aſſe in the Wilderneſſe that ſnuffeth up the wind at her pleaſure</hi> (or <hi>the deſire of her heart) in her occaſion who can turn her away?</hi> As the wild Aſſe ſet upon her pleaſure, &amp; in her occaſion, when ſhe hath a mind to it, will not be turn'd away; ſuch is the heart of man. That other Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.18.) telleth us of thoſe <hi>who draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and ſin as it were with a cart rope;</hi> that is, they ſet themſelves with all their might to doe miſchief. When men are thus vainly bent upon vanity, 'tis a mighty work of God to withdraw them from their work. When, what men are purpoſed to doe they are faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to it as with cords and cart-ropes, what but the power of the great God can withdraw them from it?</p>
                  <p>Whence note Secondly,
<q>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe God did withdraw and fetch us off from ſin, we ſhould run on in it continually.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When man is in an evill way, he hath no mind to returne till God turneth him; let come on't what will he will venture: 'Tis only through grace that the heart either abſtains or returns from evill. <hi>David</hi> ſaith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23.) <hi>I have kept my ſelf from mine iniquity. David</hi> kept himſelf from his iniquity, yet he was not his own keeper: It was by the power of God that he kept himſelf from that ſin to which he was moſt prone, even from that ſin to which his own corruptions and the Devills temptations were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes drawing him. <hi>David</hi> had ſome ſpeciall iniquity to which his heart was inclined more then any other, and from that he kept himſelf, being himſelf kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation. Of our ſelves we can neither keep our ſelves from doing iniquity, nor leave off doing that iniquity, which we have once done. How can man withhold himſelf from ſin, while ſin hath ſo great a hold of him, yea the Maſtery over him?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly Note.</p>
                  <q>God is graciouſly pleaſed both to withdraw man from doing evill and to draw him to repentance when he hath done evill.</q>
                  <p>Between theſe two the grace of God is daily working in and towards man, and it worketh for the effecting of both many wayes.</p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:104248:160"/>
                  <p>Firſt, by his word, and that in a fourfold conſideration. Firſt, by the word of his command, he every where in Scripture forbids man to doe any evill, and bids him repent of every evill which he doth. Secondly, by the word of his threatnings; they are as thunderbolts to deterre him. Thirdly, by the word of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, they are divine alluremenrs, ſweetly yet effectually to entice him. Fourthly, by the word of his perſwaſions, they are full of taking arguments to convince and win him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God withdrawes man from ſin, and drawes him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance when he hath ſinned, <hi>by his works:</hi> Firſt, by his works of Judgment, they break him to theſe duties. Secondly, by his works of mercy, they melt him into theſe duties.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God withdraws man from ſin and drawes him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance by his patience and long-ſuffering. (Rom. 2.4.) <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſſe and forbearance, and long-ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, not knowing that the goodneſs of God leadeth them to repentance.</hi> As if the Apoſtle had ſaid, O man, if thou knoweſt not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods patience towards thee, and that this is the meaning of it, thou knoweſt nothing of the mind and meaning of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Lord withdraweth man from evill purpoſes by ſeaſonable counſells. <hi>David</hi> was going on in a very bad purpoſe (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.) and God ſtirred up <hi>Abigail</hi> to meete him, and by good counſell to withdraw him from his purpoſe: This <hi>David</hi> acknowledged (<hi>verſ.</hi> 32, 33.) <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, which ſent thee this day to meet me.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>I was</hi> fully purpoſed to revenge my ſelf upon <hi>Naball,</hi> and had not ſurely left a man of his houſe alive by the morning light, if thou hadſt not met me; therefore bleſſed be God who hath ſent thee, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be thy advice, and bleſſed be thou which haſt kept me this day from coming to ſhed bloud, and haſt by thy good counſell withdrawne me from that evill purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, conſider God withdraweth man from his ſinfull purpoſe, all or any of theſe wayes, by putting forth his mighty power with them. For his word alone, his works alone, his patience alone, the counſell of man alone would not doe it, if God did not ſtretch forth his own arme in and with theſe meanes for the doing of it. Nothing is any further efficacious then as God is with it. (<hi>Numb.</hi> 22.) <hi>Balaam</hi> was going on in his wicked purpoſe, being ſent for
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:104248:161"/> by <hi>Balak</hi> to curſe the people of God: And though the Lord ſent his Angell to be an adverſary to him in his way (<hi>verſ.</hi> 22.) ſo that his Aſſe turned out of the way into the field, yet <hi>Balaam</hi> went on in his purpoſe, yea though the Angell ſtanding between two walls cauſed his Aſſe to turne ſo ſuddenly, that ſhe cruſht <hi>Balaams</hi> foot againſt the wall (<hi>verſ.</hi> 25.) yet <hi>Balaam</hi> went on in his purpoſe: Once more though the Angell went further and ſtood in a narrow way, where there was no way to turne to the right hand nor to the left, ſo that the poor Aſſe fell down under him (<hi>v.</hi> 27.) and <hi>ſpeaking</hi> (as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſeth it, 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.) <hi>with mans voyce rebuked the madneſſe of the Prophet;</hi> Yet ſo mad he was that all theſe checks and warnings, could not withdraw him from his purpoſe. And what the Lord did at that time to <hi>Balaam</hi> by an Angell, that he doth by ſome other means and providences to ſtop many from their evill purpoſes, who yet will not be ſtopt. He ſpeaks to them in the miniſtry of his word, he ſpeaks to them in his works; he ſpreads their way with roſes, he hedgeth up their way with thorns, he beſtoweth ſweet mercies upon them, he ſends ſharp afflictions upon them, to withdraw them from their evill projects and purpoſes, yet on they goe like <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,</hi> unleſſe he ſend more then an Angell, even his holy Spirit to withdraw them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Elihu</hi> reports it as a ſpeciall favour of God to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw man from his purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Whence note.</p>
                  <q>It is a great mercy to be hinder'd in ſinfull purpoſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments.</q>
                  <p>Diſappointments are acts of grace, when we are acting againſt grace; If God ſtop us from doing evill, not onely by his word, but by blowes, or by a hedge of thorns, yea if he ſtop us by a drawn ſword, it is a great mercy. Though God throw us to the ground (as he did <hi>Saul,</hi> afterwards <hi>Paul,</hi> when he went with a bloody purpoſe to vex and perſecute the Saints (<hi>Acts</hi> 9.) let us count our ſelves exalted, and rejoyce in it more then in any worldly exaltation. 'Tis a rich mercy to be kept from executing an evill purpoſe, though by our owne poverty and outward mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. The doing of that which is ſinfull, is worſe then any thing that can be done to us, or endured by us, as a ſtop againſt ſin. Sin
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:104248:161"/> hath death in it; ſin hath wrath in it; ſin hath hell in it; ſin hath Devill and all in it; therefore to be kept from ſin, let it be by what means it will, if by paines and pining ſickneſſes, if by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and diſgraces, yea if by death, we have cauſe to bleſſe God. The greateſt and ſoreſt Judgement which God powres up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſinfull men, is to let them alone in or not to withdraw them from their ſins. To be ſuffered to goe on and proſper in ſin, is the worſt of ſufferings, the laſt of Judgements, the next Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to hell it ſelfe, and an infallible ſigne of an heire of hell. Thus the wrath of God waxed hot againſt <hi>Iſrael when he gave them up to their owne hearts luſts, and they walked in their owne Councel</hi> (Pſal: 81.11.) This was the higheſt revenge that God could take upon that ſinfull people. He ſayd a little before, <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael would none of me;</hi> when God wooed them they were ſo coy, they would have none of him; and then, ſaid he, goe on, take your fill of ſin; I give you up to your owne hearts luſts. The Lord did not ſay, I gave them up to the ſword, to the famine, or to the peſtilence, but to their owne hearts luſts, and to walke on in their own way; <hi>That perſon or people may be ſure, God hath purpoſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill against them, whom he will not withdraw from their evill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</hi> The ſeverity of the wrath of God againſt the Gentiles is expreſt and ſumm'd up in this (<hi>Rom:</hi> 1.26, 28.) <hi>He gave them up to vile affections; he gave them up to a reprobate mind, to doe things which were not convenient. A naturall man left to himſelfe, will ſoone doe ſuch things as nature it ſelfe abhorreth and bluſheth at.</hi> The ſame dreadfull doome is denounced (<hi>Rev:</hi> 22.11.) <hi>He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill.</hi> I will not withdraw him from his way, let him goe on and periſh, let him goe on and ſink downe to the pit of perdition for ever. As S<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> 
                     <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> foretelling the Church, given up or left to (not in) great ſufferings of all ſorts; <hi>Here is the patience of the Saints.</hi> So when we ſee the world given up and left in great ſinnings of any ſort, eſpecially if to ſinnings of all ſorts, we may truely and ſadly ſay, <hi>Here is the wrath of God.</hi> 'Tis therefore a great mercy, if God will any way withdraw man from his ſinfull wayes and purpoſes, eſpecially when he taketh ſuch gentle wayes, as dreams and viſions, counſels and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to <hi>withdraw man from his purpoſe, and</hi> (as it followeth in this verſe) <hi>to</hi>

                  <p>Now there are two wayes by which <hi>God hideth pride from man.</hi> Firſt, by pardoning it; Secondly, preventing it. Here to hide pride from man, properly, is not to pardon it when acted, but to prevent or keep man from the acting of it; God indeed hides the pride of man by pardoning it (and that's a high act of grace) and he hideth pride from man by keeping man from doing proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or from ſhewing his pride in his doings.</p>

So God hideth (by ſome meanes or other) that which is moſt eminent in us, from us, leſt it ſhould draw us aſide to ſome undue eſtimation of it, and ſo prove but matter or fewel for pride to kindle upon.

                     </note> hath a neere cognation to this notion about hiding pride it ſelfe. Man is twice expreſt in this verſe, yet not by the ſame word; The firſt word notes man in the weakneſſe of his conſtitution, <hi>an earthly man;</hi> This ſecond notes man in the powerfulneſs of his condition, <hi>a ſtrong man,</hi> a mighty man, an eminent man, a man with all his furniture, in the fullneſs of his earthly glory and greatneſs; when man hath much naturall power, much civill power, with the various additions and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of both theſe powers upon him, then man is in greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be proud, &amp; then God <hi>hideth pride from man.</hi> And who can hide pride from ſuch a man but God alone. Men commonly blow up ſuch men with pride by great applauſes, and ſuch men have moſtly great thoughts and high apprehenſions of themſelves, and are very forward to diſcover (which is the greateſt diſcovery of their weakneſs) their owne pride. <hi>God only hideth pride from man;</hi> that is, he makes it not to be, as well as hinders i'ts appearing; that which is hidden is as if it were not. The word is uſed in that ſenſe (<hi>Job</hi> 3.10.) <hi>Becauſe he did not hide ſorrow from mine eyes;</hi> Sorrow is hidden from us when the matter of ſorrow is ſo taken away, that we ſorrow not at all. To hide pride is to take away the matter and occaſion, the incentives and motives of pride, whatſoever is a nurſe of pride, or doth encourage the pride of our hearts, that's <hi>to hide pride from man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, We may take this word, <hi>pride,</hi> in a large ſenſe, as Comprehending all ſin, <hi>He withdraweth man from his purpoſe, and hideth pride;</hi> that is, ſin of all ſorts <hi>from man;</hi> and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there is pride of one kinde or other in every act of ſin; There is a heightening of the ſpirit againſt God, ſome diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with the mind and will of God, and thence a ſetting up of our will againſt the will of God in every ſinner, eſpecially in bold and wilfull ſinners. Such ſinners would not let the will of God ſtand, but deſire that their own may. This is pride; This in ſome degree is mingled with every ſin, and pride leads to all ſin; therefore in Scripture ſometimes an humble or meek man is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ'd, not only to a proud man in ſpeciall, but to a wicked man in generall (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 147.6.) <hi>The Lord lifteth up the meek, he caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the wicked down to the ground.</hi> Where the <hi>wicked</hi> man in the latter part of the verſe, ſtands in oppoſition to the <hi>meek</hi> or hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:104248:163"/> man in the former part of it. Nor can it be denyed, but that as pride is in it ſelfe a very great wickedneſs, ſo it gives a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion and fitneſſe for the doing of all manner of wickedneſſe. And thus take it in the largeſt ſenſe, 'tis a truth that God hideth pride, that is, every ſin from man, otherwiſe he would ſoone ſhew forth any ſin as much as pride. But I rather keep to that ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Interpretation here, as pride is oppoſ'd to humilitie, which is not only a choyce grace, but the ornament of all thoſe graces which are hidden in the heart, and held out in the life of a gracious man. And thus the Lord by exerciſing man with dreams and viſions in his affliction, doth firſt ſtop and check the very purpoſes of evill, that they come not to act, and when man hath brought to paſſe or acted any good purpoſe, he keeps him from oſtentation. <hi>He hideth pride from man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It being the Lords deſigne to hide pride from man, by thoſe fore-named diſpenſations.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Firſt.</p>
                  <q>Man is naturally much diſpoſed and very prone to pride.</q>
                  <p>Thoſe things which Children are apt to abuſe or hurt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with, their parents hide from them; They will hide edge-tooles from them, leſt they get a wound by medling with them; They will hide fruit from them, leſt by eating overmuch they get a ſurfet. Thus the Lord our tender father often hides all the means and occaſions of pride from the eyes of his children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo ready to boaſt and lift up themſelves in pride. <hi>Man</hi> (as was ſhewed at the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of the former Chapter) <hi>is a proud piece of fleſh, and hath much proud fleſh in him.</hi> The Prophet ſaith (<hi>Ezek:</hi> 7.10.) <hi>Pride hath budded;</hi> pride hath a roote, and it brings forth fruit. There is a two-fold pride, or pride of two ſorts. Firſt, ſecret unſeene pride, or pride of heart; Secondly, open viſible pride, or pride of life. In alluſion to the Prophets metaphor, we may ſay, there is pride in the bud, and pride in the roote, pride buddeth outwardly.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, At the tongue, men ſpeak proud words, they ſpeak boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and vaine-gloriouſly (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 75.5.) <hi>Speak not with a ſtiff neck,</hi> that is, ſpeak not proudly. Pride budded at the tongue of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> (Dan: 4.30.) when he walked in his Pallace and ſaid, <hi>Is not this great Babell that I have built for the houſe of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:104248:163"/> the kingdome, by the might of my power, and for the honour of my Majeſty.</hi> Here was pride budding at the tongue.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Pride buddeth alſo at the eye, in ſcornfull lofty looks. <hi>David</hi> profeſt that <hi>his heart was not haughty, nor his eyes lofty</hi> (Pſal: 131.1.) The haughtineſs of many mens hearts may be ſeene at thoſe windowes of the body, the eyes, in lofty looks. Theſe are threatned with a downfall (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 18.27.) <hi>The Lord will bring downe high lookes,</hi> that is, <hi>proud men who looke highly.</hi> And againe (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 2.11.) <hi>The lofty lookes of man ſhall be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and the haughtineſs of man ſhall be bowed downe.</hi> Once more ſaith the Lord (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 10.13.) <hi>I will puniſh the fruit of the ſtout heart of the King of Aſyria, and the glory of his high lookes.</hi> There we have pride in the roote, <hi>a ſtout heart,</hi> and pride in the fruit, <hi>high lookes. (Iſa:</hi> 3.11.) <hi>The ſhew of their Countenance teſtifieth againſt them;</hi> that is, they look proudly, though (which ſhould lay them in the duſt) they live very lewdly, yea they are proud of their lewdneſs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, How often doth pride bud in apparell, in vaine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions, and new-fangled attires, in the affected adornings and trimmings of a body of clay? What are theſe but the buddings of pride? yea the flaggs and banners of pride. Some are as proud of their gay dreſſes, as the Peacock of his feathers. We com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay, <hi>Fine feathers make fine birds,</hi> but how fooliſh are thoſe birds that are proud of Feathers!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is pride of heart, or pride budding in the ſpirit of man, which doth not ſhew it ſelfe; only the mind ſwels within. When men have high thoughts of themſelves (though they doe not (as the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> hath it) ſpeake great ſwelling words of vanity, yet they have great ſwelling thoughts of vanity, then pride buddeth in their ſpirits, their minds ſwell, and the mind will ſwell more then the tongue. The tongue ſwells migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, but the heart much more. The ſpirit of a man may lift up it ſelfe on high, when the man looks very demurely. (<hi>Hab:</hi> 2.4.) <hi>Behold, his ſoule which is lifted up, is not upright in him;</hi> If the ſoule be lifted up, the man falls; He that is high-minded, cannot be upright in his minde.</p>
                  <p>It may be queſtioned, Whence it cometh to paſſe, that the ſoule of man is ſo much and ſo often lifted up with pride? What cauſeth this ſwelling and heaving of his ſpirit? I anſwer,</p>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:104248:164"/>
                  <p>Firſt, Some are proud of their birth, either, that they are borne of great men, or that they are borne of good men. The Baptiſt admoniſhed the <hi>Jewes</hi> of this piece of pride (<hi>Math:</hi> 3.19.) <hi>Thinke not to ſay within your ſelves, we have Abraham to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> As if he had ſayd, I well perceive what makes you (as we ſpeake proverbially) ſtand ſo much upon your pantafloes? and talk within your ſelves, at ſuch a rate of your ſelves, is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſtock? But I ſay unto you, let not your heart ſwell with theſe thoughts, <hi>we are Children of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; for God is able even of theſe ſtones to raiſe up children to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi> that is, God will not want a people, though he ſhould lay you aſide, and entertaine you no longer for his people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others are proud of riches, yea they <hi>boaſt of the multitude of their riches</hi> (Pſal: 49.6.) Even they who deſire to hide their riches as much as they can, yet cannot but tell the world they are proud of their riches, ſo proud, that they ſlight and contemne all men that have not as much riches as they; O what rejoycings have moſt rich men over their riches? <hi>Hezekiah</hi> a great King and a Good man (a rare conjunction) had much of that upon his ſpirit (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 39.2.) when Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours came from <hi>Babylon, He was glad of them, and ſhewed them all his treaſure;</hi> He affected they ſhould ſee what a rich King he was, and what maſſes of Gold and ſilver as well as what multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of men were at his command.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Many are proud of their honours and powers in the world; They are high-minded, becauſe they are ſet in high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; 'Tis a diſhonour to ſome great men that they have not true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great ſpirits. And 'tis the temptation of all great men to have proud ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Not a few are proud of their bodyly perfections and ſtrength; many a ſoule is defiled and deformed with pride by the bodyes beauty and faireneſſe; many look not after the beauty of holineſſe, while they doat upon the beauty of their owne comelineſſe; they ſee themſelves in their beauty, till they are proud of it, and care not (which ſhould be our greateſt care, and ſhall be our greateſt priviledge, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 33.17.) <hi>to ſee the King in his beauty.</hi> As ſome truſt in their ſpirituall beauty (<hi>Ezek:</hi> 16.15.) ſo others over-weene their corporall, both are the effects of pride; and the firſt is by ſo much the worſe of the two, by how much it riſeth from a better object.</p>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:104248:164"/>
                  <p>Fifthly, Many are proud of their naturall parts, proud of their gifts, proud of their wit, proud of their memory, proud of their eloquence and abilities of ſpeaking. As <hi>knowledge it ſelfe puffeth up</hi> (1 Cor: 8.1.) ſo doe all thoſe endowments which ſerve ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the getting or expreſſing of our knowledge. Gifts and abilities, whether naturall or improved and acquired, doe not more fit us for ſervice, then tempt us to and (unleſſe grace worke mightily) taint us with pride.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, As many are proud of what they have, ſo others are proud of what they have done, they are proud of their actions, their ſpirits ſwell with the thoughts of their owne workes. Some are ſo wicked, that they are proud of their evill workes. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>They glory in their ſhame</hi> (Phil: 3.19.) <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of many (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 4.) who <hi>turned his glory into ſhame;</hi> but theſe turne their ſhame into glory, that is, they are proud of that for which they ought to be aſhamed. Now if ſome are proud of the evill, of the miſchief which they have done, how eaſily may we grow proud of the good which we have done? proud of our duties, proud of our righteous deeds, proud of our charitable deeds to men, proud of our prayers to God, proud of our zeale for God, as <hi>Jehu</hi> was who ſayd, <hi>Come and ſee my zeale for the Lord.</hi> The heart of a good man may ſoone have too much to doe with what he hath done, his thoughts may quickly worke too much towards and upon his owne workes. But as for hypocrites and ſelfe-ſeekers, who doe good to be ſeene of men, they cannot forbeare ſeeing it themſelves, and ſurely that ſight of the eye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but affect the heart with pride.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Pride riſeth often from the ſucceſſe of what is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted and done, men are proud of victories. The <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> is deſcribed (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 10.13, 14.) triumphing and inſulting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>he had put downe the nations as a valiant man.</hi> And (<hi>Hab:</hi> 1.16.) we have the <hi>Chaldeans ſacrificing to their net, and burning incenſe to their drage, becauſe by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous;</hi> that is, they boaſted of and gloried in their great atchievements in warre; ſo it ſeemes to be explained in the next words (<hi>v.</hi> 17.) <hi>Shall they therefore empty their net, and not ſpare continually to ſlay the nations?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Pride ſpringeth out of the very mercies and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God. Thus 'tis ſayd of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (2 Chron: 32.25.)
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:104248:165"/> after he had received two great mercies; Firſt, deliverance from a great enemy; and, Secondly, from a great ſickneſſe; <hi>He ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred not againe according to the benefit done unto him, for his heart was lifted up.</hi> How lifted up? not in thankfulneſſe, for he rendred not according to the kindneſſe, but in pride and high-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for preſently it is ſaid (<hi>v.</hi> 26.) <hi>Notwithſtanding Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah humbled himſelfe for the pride of his heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ninthly, The heart is lifted up and waxeth proud with Church-Priviledges; Some ſay, they are in the Church, or they are the Church; they enjoy pure ordinances and adminiſtrations of holy worſhip above others. For this kind of pride the Prophet reproved the <hi>Jewes</hi> (Jer: 7.3, 4.) <hi>Heare ye the word of the Lord, all ye of Judah, that enter in at theſe gates to worſhip the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Truſt ye not in lying words, ſaying, The temple of the Lord, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord are we; The temple of the Lord are theſe;</hi> As if he had ſayd, Be not proud of the Temple (what we truſt to, beſides God, we are proud of) nor of your Temple priviledges, you will find no ſanctuary, no ſecurity there, unleſſe you amend your wayes; theſe things will doe you no good, except you be better. The <hi>Jewes</hi> were taxed alſo by the Apoſtle for ſuch a proud cry (<hi>Rom:</hi> 2.17.) <hi>Thou makeſt thy boaſt of God;</hi> and can a man doe better then to boaſt of God? but they ſwell'd with pride, they did not rejoyce with thankfulneſſe, they contemn'd others, as if God were a God to them only, and ſaw ſomewhat in them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others, as the reaſon why he choſe them for his people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others. This was pride of ſpirit, or ſpirituall pride. And againe to the <hi>Jew</hi> (v. 22.) <hi>Thou that makeſt thy boaſt of the Law;</hi> And is it not our duty to boaſt of the law or word of God? But the Apoſtle ſaw them proud of the Law, not obedient to it; He perceived their hearts were lifted up in their priviledge of having the letter of the Law, while both their hearts and lives were unconformed and unſubdued to the ſpirituallneſſe of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Pride is ready to riſe in the heart of man from that divine light &amp; thoſe extraordinary Revelations which he receives from God; and it is hard to keep the heart under when God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers very much of himſelfe to man. This was <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 12.7.) <hi>Lest I ſhould be lifted up above meaſure through the aboundance of revelations, there was given me a thorne in the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:104248:165"/> fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan to buffet me.</hi> Even <hi>Paul</hi> in that caſe needed a thorne in his fleſh to let out or prevent the Impoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his ſpirit. Some conceive the reaſon why the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is ſo often called, <hi>Son of Man,</hi> was to keepe him humble, while he had many revelations from God.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, Some have been proud not only of divine and heavenly, but of diabolicall and helliſh Revelations. We read of one <hi>Theudas boaſting himſelfe to be ſome body</hi> (Acts 5.36.) This vaine man pretended revelations from God, which were indeed from the Devill; And he ſwell'd with this conceit, boaſted himſelfe to be <hi>ſome body,</hi> that is, he thought himſelfe to be <hi>every body;</hi> as if the perfections of all men were Center'd in him, or as if all others were <hi>no body,</hi> and he himſelfe the only <hi>ſome body.</hi> The Apoſtle (<hi>Acts</hi> 8.9.) ſpeaking of <hi>Symon,</hi>

                     </note> who had uſed ſorcery and bewitched the people of <hi>Samaria,</hi> ſaith, <hi>He gave out that himſelfe was ſome great one;</hi> he ſwell'd with pride from his diabolicall Revelations; giving out not only (as <hi>Theudas</hi>) that he was <hi>ſome body,</hi> but that he was <hi>ſome great one.</hi> Though indeed for a man to report himſelfe <hi>ſome body,</hi> is (as both learned Grecians and Latines noted in the Margin tell us) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himſelfe a Great one. And who are greater in pride, then they who make Great reports of themſelves, or report them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves great?</p>
                  <p>How great a proneneſs there is in the heart of man to pride, may appeare by all theſe inſtances; by which it appeares that as there is much pride abiding in man, ſo by all or any of theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions it is dayly budding out, unleſſe God hide it from man, and nip it in the bud.</p>
                  <p>Yet here it may be queſtioned; Whence it cometh to paſſe, that man is ſo prone to pride? or what is the ſpring of it?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; Firſt, Pride ſprings from Inordinate ſelfe-love, (2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3.2.) <hi>Men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves, Covetous, Boaſters, Proud.</hi> They that are undue lovers of themſelves, or in love with themſelves, they preſently grow proud of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Selfe-love, and ſelfe-flattery, are glaſſes in which if a man look upon himſelfe, he appears double to what he is, or much greater then what he really is. Selfe-love is a <hi>multiplying,</hi> yea and a <hi>magnifying glaſſe.</hi> 'Tis dangerous to ſee our ſelves through our owne ſelfe-love; That ſight of ſelfe affects the heart with
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:104248:166"/> high thoughts of ſelfe, which high thoughts the Lord would have all men caſt downe, or caſt away, while he gives that admonition by his Apoſtle to the <hi>Romans (Rom:</hi> 12.3.) <hi>Let no man thinke of himſelfe more highly then he ought to thinke</hi> (that is, let him not thinke highly of himſelfe at all) but (as it followeth in the ſame verſe) <hi>Soberly, or to ſobriety.</hi> For indeed many are drunken, yea mad, or mad-drunke with high, that is, proud thoughts of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Hence that of the ſame Apoſtle (<hi>Gal:</hi> 6.3.) <hi>If a man think himſelfe to be ſomething, when he is nothing, he deceiveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;</hi> he that thinks himſelfe to be ſomething, is he that hath proud thoughts of himſelfe; and ſuch a <hi>ſomething,</hi> is a meere <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> that is, is no ſuch thing as he thinks himſelfe to be; as is cleare in the caſe of the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> (Rev: 3.16.) Hence</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Pride ſprings from an opinion that what we have is better then indeed it is; the proud man thinks all his ſilver gold, and his braſs ſilver. We ſpeak proverbially of ſuch, <hi>All their geeſe are ſwans;</hi> they alwayes over-rate their own commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Pride ſprings from this falſe opinion, that what we have, we have it from our ſelves, or that 'tis of our own getting. The Apoſtles Pride-confounding queſtion, is, (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 4.7.) <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi> As if he had ſayd, the true reaſon why men boaſt, or the ground of all their proud boaſting is this, they think not themſelves beholding to any for what they have; all is of themſelves, or by a ſelfe-improvement; they have ſomewhat (they imagine) which they have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The proud man thinkes what he hath, he alone hath it; at leaſt, that he hath it in a greater meaſure then any other. He is the Cedar, others are but ſhrubs. He is the Giant, others are but dwarfes. Only the humble attaine that rule (<hi>Rom:</hi> 12.10.) <hi>In honour preferring one another:</hi> as alſo that (<hi>Phil:</hi> 2.3.) <hi>In lowlineſs of mind, let each eſteeme other better then himſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Pride riſeth from this thought, that what we have, we ſhall alwayes have. Holy <hi>David</hi> began to be blowne up with pride, as ſoone as ever <hi>he ſayd in his proſperity, I ſhall never be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Babylon glorified her ſelfe, having ſayd in her heart, I ſit a Queene, and am no widdow, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow,</hi> (Revel: 18.7.)</p>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:104248:166"/>
                  <p>Secondly, In that God is here ſayd <hi>to hide pride from man;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Pride is a very vile and moſt odious ſin.</q>
                  <p>If God hide it from mans eyes, then ſurely God himſelfe is of purer eyes then to behold it, and be pleaſed. (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 138.6.) <hi>The Lord knoweth the proud afar off;</hi> He that meets a ſpectacle or perſon which he cannot endure to look upon, avoydes it, or turnes from it while he is yet afar off; whereas if the object be delightfull, he draweth neer, and comes as cloſe as he can; when therefore 'tis ſayd, <hi>the Lord knoweth a proud man afar off,</hi> it ſhews his diſdaine of him, <hi>He will ſcarce touch him with a paire of tongs,</hi> (as we ſay) he cannot abide to come neere him. He knows well enough how vile he is even at the greateſt diſtance. Pride is the firſt of thoſe ſeven <hi>things which are an abomination to the Lord, (Prov:</hi> 6.17.) And how abominable a thing pride is, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare further by theſe ſix Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The folly and Irrationallity of pride, renders it odious to God; nothing is more odious to a wiſe man then folly, how o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious then is pride to the moſt wiſe God! When <hi>Paul</hi> did any thing which had but a ſhew of pride in it, though he did it only upon Conſtraint, yet he calls himſelfe foole for doing it (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 12.11.) <hi>I am become a foole in glorying, ye have compelled me.</hi> Doth not this intimate, that in <hi>Pauls</hi> opinion, all proud ſelfe-gloriers and boaſters are fooles, that is, ſuch as act below common ſenſe or reaſon. In the Hebrew language, the ſame word that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies boaſting and pride, ſignifies folly and fooliſhneſſe. The empty veſſell yeilds the greateſt ſound; and they that make ſo great a noiſe of themſelves, are uſually nothing elſe but a Great noyſe themſelves, at leaſt they unavoydably rayſe ſuſpition of themſelves, that they are but empty veſſells, or ſhallow rivers. This was <hi>Solomons</hi> concluſion (<hi>Pro:</hi> 25.27.) <hi>For men to ſearch their owne glory is no glory;</hi> that is, a man obſcures himſelfe by ſelfe-glorying. How fooliſh, how irrationall a thing is it for any man to glory proudly, when as by doing ſo he obſcures that which is the chiefeſt glory of man as man, his reaſon; and ſeemes to put himſelfe to the queſtion, whether he be a reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture yea or no.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Pride is more abominable, becauſe it is not only
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:104248:167"/> the folly of man, but a robbery of God; nothing robs God of his honour ſo much as pride. It is ſaid of Jeſus Chriſt (<hi>Phil:</hi> 2.6.) <hi>He thought it no robbery to be equall with God;</hi> He did not wrong God in making himſelfe his equall, himſelfe being God. But if men will match themſelves with God, or are lifted up in their ſpirits, (as proud men are beyond the line of man) this is a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery of God. Whatſoever we take to our ſelves more then is due, we take from God, yea we ſteale from God. They who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get God the author and fountaine of all they have, and take glory to themſelves, commit the worſt kind of robbery, and are the moſt dangerous Theeves. (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 42.8.) <hi>My glory will I not give to another;</hi> therefore if any take glory to themſelves (as (I ſay againe) all proud men doe) 'tis ſtealing, and 'tis not only (as I may ſay) picking of his pocket, but the breaking open of his Treaſury, of his Cabinet, to carry away the chief Jewel of his Crowne, ſo is <hi>his glory</hi> (Rom: 11.36.) <hi>All is from him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all muſt be to him;</hi> all is from the father of light, therefore what light, what gifts, what ſtrength ſoever we have, it muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to him in prayſes, and in the glorifying of his name; we may not deck or adorne our own name with it, nor put our name upon it? How much ſoever we have we have received, it is from the Lord; therefore 'tis extreamly ſinfull and ſacrilegious to take or keepe it to our ſelves. And as whatſoever good we have we have it of God, ſo whatſoever good we have done, we have had light and ſtrength from God to doe it; naturall yea ſpirituall ſtrength, not only the firſt power of acting, but all ſubſequent actings of that power are from God; therefore to have ſecret liftings up of ſpirit, in our owne actings, is to rob God (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 51.15.) <hi>Open thou my lips, and my mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe,</hi> ſayd <hi>David;</hi> As if he had ſayd, Lord if thou wilt open my lips, and help me to ſpeak as I ought, I will not ſhew forth my owne praiſe, nor boaſt of what I have either ſpoken or done, but I will ſhew forth thy praiſe; becauſe the opening of the lips is from thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is an abomination to be proud; for whatſoever any man hath done, or how good ſoever any man is, he is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he ſhould be, and hath done no more then was his duty to doe; he hath done but his duty to God, and his duty to man, when he hath done his beſt, he hath done no more; every man is
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:104248:167"/> bound to doe the good that he doth, how much ſoever it be that he doth; therefore it is both an ignoble and an abominable thing for any man to boaſt of what he hath done.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Is it abominable to boaſt of what we have done, ſeeing how much ſoever we have done, it will appeare upon a right and due account, that we have done leſſe then we ought, and are much ſhort of our duty, (<hi>Luke</hi> 17.10.) <hi>When ye ſhall have done all thoſe things which are commanded you, ſay, we are unprofitable ſervants, and have done but that which was our duty to doe.</hi> We can doe nothing but what is our duty, but all we doe is not the one halfe of our whole duty, and ſhall we glory as if we had obliged God by doing more then all!</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It is an odious thing for any man to be proud of what he hath done, for God might have done it by another if he pleaſed. No man is neceſſary to God, as if his worke could not be done unleſſe ſuch a one doe it. He hath choyce of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and is able to fit thoſe for his buſineſſe who are moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of themſelves. It is matter of thankfulneſſe that God will call and uſe us to doe him any ſervice, and enable us to doe it; God could have put his talent into another mans hand; the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the power, the wiſdome, the learning, the parts which thou acteſt by, he could have put it into other hands; he can make the dumb to ſpeak, as well as the greateſt ſpeaker; He can make an Ideot, a Dunce, knowing and learned, as well as the moſt knowing among the learned. Therefore the learned, the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, have no reaſon to be proud, but much to be thankfull; He can make the weakeſt to doe as much as the ſtrongeſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſtrongeſt have no reaſon to be proud, but much to be thankfull; He can raiſe Children to <hi>Abraham</hi> out of the ſtones of the ſtreet; therefore the <hi>Jewes</hi> muſt not be proud, or thinke that God is beholding to them for being his people; <hi>He can or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine ſtrength and his owne praiſe out of the mouthes of babes and ſucklings</hi> (Pſal: 8.2. Math: 21, 16.) therefore the wiſe and prudent have no reaſon to be proud, but much to be thankfull. O remember, It is of Gods vouchſafement not of our deſert, that we are admitted to his ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Pride muſt needs be an odious thing, and that which God greatly abhorr's, becauſe it quite croſſeth the deſigne of God in the Goſpel; which is to keep the creature humble and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:104248:168"/> low, that he himſelfe alone may be exalted; <hi>He will not beare it that any fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence; He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord</hi> (1 Cor: 1.29, 31.) God will have his end up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all fleſh, and therefore he will dreadfully glorifie himſelfe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe, who proudly glory in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Further, The word by which man is expreſſed, from whom God hides pride ſignifying (as was ſhewed) <hi>a ſtrong mighty man,</hi> the moſt accompliſhed and beſt furniſhed man.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Thirdly.</p>
                  <q>Great men, wiſe men, rich men, are very ſubject to and often carried away by pride.</q>
                  <p>God therefore hides pride from them, becauſe they lie ſo open to the aſſaults of pride; our riſing is oftentimes an occaſion of our falling. And that which God gives man for his good, proves (by reaſon of this corruption moſtly) his ſnare. One of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients ſpeaking of Pride, ſaith 'tis the greateſt ſin for foure reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In the antiquity of it, becauſe it was the firſt ſin, the Devill's ſin, before man ſinned; that ſin which he firſt dropt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man to make him fall, was the ſin by which himſelfe fell; he would be higher, and more then he was, and he provoked man to be ſo too. 'Tis diſputed what was the original of original ſin, and the doubt lyeth between two, whether unbeliefe or pride had the precedency in mans fall, (a queſtion much like that, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faith or repentance hath the precedency in his riſing) I ſhall only ſtate it thus; that which appear'd firſt was unbeliefe; the woman put a peradventure upon the threatning of God in caſe of eating the forbidden fruit. But certainly pride was Contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with unbeliefe; man would needs lift up himſelfe beyond the ſtate he had, and ſo fell from and loſt that eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Saith he, Pride is productive of many other ſins, 'tis a fountaine ſin, a root ſin, it nouriſheth, nurſeth, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up many other ſins; no man knoweth what ſin may be next when pride is firſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The greatneſs of the ſin of pride may be argued from the over-ſpreading of it; pride hath infected many mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally; and who can ſay his heart is free from this plague, though poſſibly it be not the plague (or ſpeciall maſter ſin) of his heart?
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:104248:168"/> Pride is an Epidemicall diſeaſe, all labour under this ſickneſſe, and this ſickneſſe hath got the maſtery over many.</p>
                  <p>His fourth reaſon is that of the text and poynt; Pride is a great wickedneſſe, becauſe uſually it infects great men. They that are great in power, great in gifts, great in learning, great in any thing, are ſure to be aſſaulted if not blemiſhed and blaſted with this ſin, inſomuch that it had been better for many to have been fools, then learned, low then high, meane then great, poore then rich in this world. There is a temptation in power, in greatneſs, in riches, in knowledge, in gifts, in the beſt things, to make the mind ſwell, and the man that is ſtored with them proud. Pride is (as I may ſay) of a very high extraction, it was conceived in and borne by the now Apoſtate Angels, whoſe place, <hi>firſt eſtate (or principality,</hi> as we put in the Margin of the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude v.</hi> 6.) was aloft in heaven. Angels were the neereſt ſervants and attendants upon God himſelfe, who calleth heaven <hi>the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his holineſſe, and of his glory;</hi> And ſurely the habitation which the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> in the ſame verſe ſaith the Angels <hi>left,</hi> (and he calls it <hi>their owne,</hi> that is, that which was allotted and allowed them by God as their portion, this habitation, I ſay,) muſt needs be a very high and excellent one, as themſelves by nature were in the higheſt claſſis or forme of creatures. Now as pride began from and had its birth in theſe high and noble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits (which gave one occaſion (though it be as helliſh a luſt as any in hell) to call it Heavenly by Nation) ſo the higher men are (who at higheſt are but duſt) the more doth pride haunt them, and inſinuate it ſelfe to get a dwelling of ſeate in them,<note place="margin">Quia natione coeleſtis ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> as the moſt proper and congeniall ſubjects which it can find here on earth it ſelfe, with thoſe of whom it firſt tooke poſſeſſion and whom it made its firſt habitation, being for ever caſt downe from heaven. Pride having once dwell in thoſe who were ſo high, loves ſtill to dwell or take up its lodging (at leaſt) in thoſe, who upon any reference whether to naturall, civill, or ſpirituall things, are called and reputed <hi>Higheſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve; Fourthly.</p>
                  <q>God by various meanes, even by all ſorts of meanes, gives check to the pride of man, he ſpeaketh once, yea twice to man in a dreame, in a viſion of the night, that he may hide pride from man.</q>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:104248:169"/>
                  <p>Pride is a ſin which God proſecutes both night and day; if ſpeaking by day doth not mortifie it, ſpeaking in the night by dreams ſhall. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was full of pride, and God hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him by a dream, and brought downe the haughtineſſe of his heart by a viſion of the night. This great Monarch of the world was ſo full of pride that he boaſted it out (<hi>Dan:</hi> 4.30.) <hi>Is not this great Babylon that I have built for the houſe of the kingdome, and by the might of my power, and for the honour of my Majeſty?</hi> Now while he ſpake thus walking in the Palace of the kingdome of <hi>Babylon, there fell a voyce from heaven, ſaying, O King Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar, to thee it is ſpoken, The kingdome is departed from thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And they ſhall drive thee from among men, And thy dwelling</hi> (who haſt thought thy ſelfe more then man) <hi>ſhall be with the beaſts of the field.</hi> The effect of this voyce <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had in a dreame, as appeares by <hi>Daniels</hi> interpretation of it in the former part of the Chapter. God ſhewed him in that dreame what his condition ſhould be, and he executed it upon him to the full, to pull downe his pride; That, <hi>he at last might know that the moſt High ruleth the Kingdomes of men, and giveth them to whomſoever he will.</hi> Whereas then he thought that he alone ruled the world, and could give kingdomes to whom he would. How wonderfully did God oppoſe the pride of <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpirit, he could not favour pride, no not in that eminent Apoſtle, <hi>Lest through the abundance of revelations he ſhould he exalted above meaſure, there was given him a thorne in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan to buffet him,</hi> (2 Cor: 12.7.) that is, God uſed extraordinary means to humble him. As here God is ſaid to humble by viſions, ſo there <hi>Paul</hi> being endanger'd to pride by receiving viſions, God found a ſtrange way to humble him, even by the bufferings of the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of Satan, who is the Prince of pride, and as (God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the Leviathan at the 42<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Chapter of this booke, <hi>v.</hi> 34.) <hi>a king over all the children of pride.</hi> God doth ſo much reſiſt pride, that he cannot but <hi>reſiſt the proud (James</hi> 4, 6.) and <hi>ſcorne the ſcorners,</hi> (Pro: 3.34.) yea he hath told us of a day (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 2.11.) wherein <hi>the lofty lookes of man ſhall be humbled, and the haughtineſs of men ſhall be bowed downe: and the Lord alone ſhall be exalted in that day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are foure ſpeciall pride ſubduing Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They who are proud of what they have, are like to have
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:104248:169"/> no more, When the Apoſtle had ſayd (<hi>James</hi> 4.6.) <hi>He reſiſteth the proud</hi> (he preſently adds) <hi>but giveth more grace to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> As if he had ſayd, Though the Lord hath given proud men much (for 'tis ſome gift of God, and uſually a great one of which men grow proud) yet he will now ſtop his hand and give them no more. The Lord gives to them who are humble and praiſe him, not to thoſe who are proud and praiſe themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Not only doth the Lord ſtop his hand from giving more to thoſe who are proud, but often makes an act of revocation and takes away that which he hath already given. As he who Idly puts his talent into a napkin, ſo he who vainely and vain-gloriouſly ſhews it, is in danger of having it taken away from him. <hi>It is as ſinfull to ſhew our talent proudly, as to hide it negligently. Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> boaſted proudly of his kingdome, and preſently it was ſayd to him, <hi>The kingdome is departed from thee. Hezekiah</hi> boaſted of his treaſure (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 39.6.) and by and by the Lord told him, his treaſure ſhould be taken away, (though not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from him, yet from his poſterity) and carried to <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> 'Tis ſo in ſpiritualls, when we proudly ſhew our treaſure, the treaſures of our knowledge, or other gifts and attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Lord many times, in judgement, ſends them into captivity, takes them from us, and ſtrips us naked of that cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and adorning whereof we are proud.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If God doth not take all away, yet what remaines is withered and blaſted, it dries up and comes to little; if it be not quite removed, yet it appeares no more in its former beauty and luſter. When <hi>God with rebukes correcteth man for (this) iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he maketh his beauty</hi> (the beauty of his parts and gifts, yea of his graces) <hi>to conſume away</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 39.11.) <hi>like a moth.</hi> O what a dryneſs, and ſo a decayedneſs falls upon that ſoule from whom the ſoaking dewes and drops, the ſweete influences of heaven are reſtrained! And ſurely if they are reſtrained from any, they are from proud men; No marvaile then, if others ſee and they feele their witherings, and even ſenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble declinings every day.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Suppoſe the gifts and parts of a proud man conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue florid and appeare ſtil acting in their former ſtrength, vigour, and beauty, yet God ſends a ſecret curſe upon them, and though he doth not wither them, yet he doth not delight in them, not
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:104248:170"/> give them any acceptation. The beſt things how long ſoever continued to proud men, are no longer bleſſings to them; yea it had been good for them, that either they had never had them, or that they had been ſoone taken away. That as one ſayd falſely of the life of man in generall,<note place="margin">Optimum eſt non naſci pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ximum cito mori.</note> but truely of wicked men; <hi>It had been beſt for them not to have been borne, and their next beſt would be to dye quickly.</hi> So I may ſay in this caſe of proud men; It had been beſt for them they never had received any eminent gifts from God, and their next beſt would be to have them quickly taken away; For as wicked men in General (if they dye uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted) the longer they live, the worſer they live, and every day by adding new heapes of ſin, heape up further wrath againſt the day of wrath; So proud men in ſpeciall, the longer they have and hold their gifts, their riches, their honours, their powers, doe but abuſe them the more, to the increaſe of their ſin here, and (without repentance) ſhame hereafter.</p>
                  <p>And therefore to ſhut up this obſervation, and the expoſition of this verſe, I ſhall only give ſome few directions or counſels for the cure of this ſoule-ſickneſs pride, or for the pricking of a pride-ſwolne heart, that ſo the winde, that noxious winde of oſtentation, by which proud men are vainely puft up in their fleſhly mindes, may be let out and voyded.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Let the proud man conſider what he is; Some have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked blaſphemouſly, <hi>What is the Almighty?</hi> as we ſaw at the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of this Booke: But it may well enough be asked, <hi>What is man that the Almighty ſhould be mindfull of him</hi> (Pſal: 144.3, 4.) and may we not much more queſtion againe, <hi>What is man that he ſhould be ſo mindfull of himſelfe? David,</hi> a great king ſaid to the Lord (2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 7.18.) <hi>Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my houſe, that thou haſt brought me hitherto?</hi> Thus every man ſhould ſay to himſelfe, or put the queſtion to his owne ſoule; <hi>Who am I? or what am I,</hi> that I ſhould have a proud thought? All men indeed differ in ſome things, and ſome differ in very many things. Men of high degree, and men of low degree differ, men of knowledge and ignorance differ, learned and unlearned men differ. And it is not only, as I may ſay, a peice of heraldry, but a peice of divinity to keep up the differences of men. Yet what is any man, whether high or low, knowing or ignorant, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or urlearned, that he ſhould be proud? they all agree in this,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:104248:170"/> they are all duſt and aſhes, they are all but as a ſhaddow, or a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, they are all as graſſe, or as a flower of the field, and at their beſt eſtate (in the very hight of their excellency) they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vanity. How much ſoever men differ in other things, yet in this they all agree, or are all alike in this, they are all vanity. Then what is man that he ſhould be proud? ſhall duſt and aſhes, ſhall a paſſing ſhaddow, or a diſappearing vapour, ſhall withering graſſe, or fading flowers, ſhall vanity it ſelfe be proud? The beſt of men at their beſt, are the worſt of all theſe, why then ſhould any man be proud? Yea I may put the queſtion further, <hi>How can any man be proud, who knoweth what man is?</hi> and acknowledgeth himſelfe to be but a man. I will adde yet further in this queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning way, How can any man be proud who knoweth himſelfe to be (which is a more humbling conſideration, then any of or then all the former) a ſinfull man! We ought alwayes to be humbled for ſin, and ſhall we who are at all times ſinning, be proud at any time?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To cure pride of ſpirit, Conſider what ever man is (as to this world) he cannot be long what he is. He that is high in the world, cannot be long in his worldly heights. He that is rich in the world, cannot be long enjoy his worldly riches; yea know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge vaniſheth; all ſuch kinde of knowledge, learning and skill as men now have, is a meere vaniſhing thing; man, in his higheſt perfections, is very mutable, and the higher he is, the more mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table he is; what hath he then to be proud of? We have ſome changes every day, and when a few dayes are paſt, we ſhall come to our great change; our change by death is but a few dayes off, for the utmoſt of our dayes are but few. As man is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of by others, ſo not by himſelfe, <hi>becauſe his breath is in his noſtrills,</hi> and he may quickly periſh (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 2.22.) Shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing things be proud things? Shall they be lifted up with what they have, who (as to this world) have ſo little being, that they can ſcarcely be ſayd to be. By this argument all men are called off from truſting thoſe that are higheſt in this world (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 146.3.) <hi>Their breath goeth forth.</hi> And we have the ſame argument, not to be high in our owne thoughts, becauſe our breath goeth forth, and there is an end of us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider all thoſe things which are as fewel and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of pride in man, even for thoſe man muſt ſhortly give an
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:104248:171"/> account. And ſurely he who remembers that whatſoever he hath, be it riches, ſtrength, honour, parts, knowledge, or learning, he muſt come to a reckoning for it, that man will not over-reckon himſelfe ſo much for it, as to be proud of it. The Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>So then every man muſt give an account of himſelfe to God, (Rom:</hi> 14.12.) That is, of all his receits, and of all his expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, what hath been beſtowed upon him, and how he hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved what hath been beſtowed. He muſt give an account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his naturall capacity as a man; and he muſt give account of himſelfe in his civill capacity, as a rich or great man; and he muſt give account of himſelfe in his ſpirituall capacity, as he hath enjoyed meanes to make him gracious, or to grow in grace. He muſt give an account of himſelfe about all the good things he hath received, what good he hath done with them, either to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe or others. He that is ſerious upon ſuch a meditation as this, ſhall finde two effects of it; Firſt, it will keep him very buſie, and free him from Idleneſſe; Secondly, it will keep him very humble and free him from pride. Who can glory vainely in his Stewardſhip (for all we have is put into our hands as Stewards, who, I ſay, can glory vainely in his Stewardſhip) that alwayes heares this voyce ſounding in his ears, <hi>Come give an account of thy ſtewardſhip, for thou mayeſt be no longer Steward.</hi> O how ill an account will they make when they are asked, what they have done with their riches? who muſt anſwer, <hi>We have been proud of them;</hi> who being asked, what have you done with your honour, muſt anſwer, <hi>we have been proud of it;</hi> who being asked, what have you done with your knowledge? muſt anſwer, <hi>we have been proud of it.</hi> Theſe will be ſad anſwers in the day of account, yet proud men (whatſoever they have done with their receits) muſt make this anſwer, what other anſwer ſoever they make.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider that the more any one hath received (and it is the degree upon which pride riſeth the more, I ſay the more any one hath received) in any kinde whatſoever, the ſtricter will his account be; for the account will be proportionable to what the receipt is. (<hi>Luke</hi> 12.48.) <hi>To whom ſoever much is given, of him ſhall be much required, and to whom men have committed much, of him they will aske the more;</hi> where much is ſowne, there God looks to reap much. He looketh not only for improving, but for ſutable, for proportionable improvement. If he that had
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:104248:171"/> received five talents (<hi>Math:</hi> 25.) had brought only two ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents more, and ſo made his five ſeven, this had not been propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable; or if he that had received two, had made them three, this had not been proportionable; but he that received five, brought ten; and he that received two, brought foure; This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was proportionable to the receipt; and therefore to theſe their Lord ſayd, <hi>Well done good and faithfull ſervants.</hi> God looks for doubling, (as I may ſay) that we ſhould make his five ten, his two foure. Therefore why ſhould any man be proud of what he hath received, ſeeing the more he hath received, the more great and ſtricter will his account be.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That pride may be cured and hid from your eyes, I adviſe, That <hi>in the midſt of your fullneſs, you would think of your emptineſs, and in the midſt of your perfections, of your deficiencies;</hi> think how much, and in how many things you are wanting, when any thought of pride ariſeth concerning what you enjoy, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you abound. He that thinks how much he is wanting, will not be proud how much ſoever be aboundeth; and indeed our want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings being a great deale more then our aboundings, and our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections then our perfections, ſhould be to us greater matter of humbling, then our abounding or perfections can be an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of pride. To cleare this further, Conſider your deficiencies two wayes; Firſt, in your ſelves; conſider how low you are in knowledge, how low in grace, how low in duty; remember that there is a great deale of darkneſs in the beſt of your light, a great deale of water in the beſt of your wine, and a great deale of droſs in the pureſt of your ſilver; remember theſe weakneſſes in your ſelves, and then ſay as bleſſed <hi>Paul (Phil:</hi> 5.22.) <hi>I count not that I have already attained;</hi> that is, that I have attained per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, I am very much behinde, very much below my duty, I am below what I might be and have attained to, both in the light of knowledge, and in the ſtrength of grace. I am below what I might be attained to, both as to zeale for, and as to faith in God. O how many are our deficiencies when we have profited moſt! Secondly, Conſider your deficiencies in reference to others; The Apoſtle ſaith (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 10.12.) <hi>They who compare themſelves with themſelves are not wiſe.</hi> The reaſon why many think themſelves over-wiſe, is, becauſe they do not (as they ought) compare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with others, or if they compare themſelves with others,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:104248:172"/> they compare themſelves only with thoſe that are below, not with thoſe who are above themſelves. They who compare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with themſelves, or with thoſe only who are below them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are not wiſe, though they think themſelves very wiſe. If we would compare our ſelves with other men, who are above us, it would mightily keep down the pride of our ſpirits; for who is there but might ſee more in ſome, yea in many others then in himſelfe? Now, as it is an excellent means to keep the ſoule from murmuring and diſcontent, to conſider that many others are below us; ſo it is an excellent means to keep us from pride, to conſider that many others are above us; ſo much above us, that our knowledge is but ignorance to their knowledge, our ſtrength weakneſſe, our faith unbeliefe, our patience unquiteneſſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, our very fruitfullneſſe barrenneſſe compared with theirs; or to ſpeak alluſively, that our fat kine are but leane to the fat ones of others, and our full ears but withered looked upon with their full eares. And as it is a good meanes to keepe the ſoule humble or to cure it of pride, to compare our ſelves with men who are much above us, ſo eſpecially, if we would but remember how much God is above us in compariſon of whom all our fullneſs is indeed emptineſs, our ſtrength weakneſſe, our riches poverty, and our light darkneſs. And therefore when <hi>Job</hi> (Chap: 42.) began to compare himſelfe with God, and to ſet God before him, then he was in the duſt preſently; though he ſpake over-valuingly of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſometime, yet when once he came to ſet himſelfe before God, then ſaith he, <hi>I have ſpoken once, but I will ſpeak no more; I abhorre my ſelfe, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> And when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaw the Lord in his Glory, and compared himſelfe with him, he cryed out, <hi>I am undone, I am a man of poluted lips;</hi> all his graces, and all his gifts vaniſhed into nothing, when he conſidered the Lord before whom he ſtood. Thus we may keepe downe pride by conſidering our deficiencies, and comparing our ſelves with others who are above us, eſpecially by comparing our ſelves with God, to whom we are not ſo much as a drop of the bucket to the whole Ocean, nor the duſt of the ballance to the body of the whole earth.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, For the hideing and keeping downe of pride, often reflect upon your own ſinfulneſſe; our defects in good may keepe our hearts low, but our abundance of ſinfull evills may keepe
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:104248:172"/> them much lower. While we conſider ſin in a two-fold notion, how ſhould it humble us? Firſt, as dwelling or abiding in us; Secondly, as acted and brought forth by us in either of theſe wayes; look on ſin, and the heart muſt needs come downe; thus poyſon may expell poyſon, the remembrance of ſin abiding in us and acted by us, may be a ſtop to the further acting, as of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins, ſo eſpecially of this ſin, pride.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Let us be much in the meditation of Chriſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and abaſing himſelfe for us. What can kill pride, if the humblings of Chriſt doe not? O how may we ſchoole and cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe our proud ſoules with the remembrances of Chriſt in his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſements! What! an humble Chriſt, and a proud Chriſtian! an humble Maſter, and a proud Diſciple! did Chriſt empty himſelfe and make himſelfe of no reputation, and ſhall we who are but emptineſſe be lifted up with a reputation of our ſelves, or with the reputation which others have of us; did he abaſe himſelfe to the forme of a ſervant, and ſhall we lift up our ſelves, as if we reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as Kings! he humbled himſelfe and became obedient to death, even the death of the Croſſe; and what have we to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in but the Croſſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt (<hi>Gal:</hi> 6.14.) if we have any thing to be proud of, 'tis the Croſſe of Chriſt, <hi>God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) that I ſhould glory</hi> (or rejoyce and triumph) <hi>ſave in the Croſſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whereby I am crucified to the world, and the world to me.</hi> Think often and much of the humblings of Chriſt, and then you will think of your ſelves as meere nothings. This is the moſt effectuall means, through the Spirit, to bring downe the ſwellings of our hearts, and <hi>to hide pride from man.</hi> Thus much of the ſecond deſigne of Chriſt in ſpeaking to man in dreames and viſions of the night; the third followeth.</p>

                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:104248:173"/>
                  <p>Some referre this <hi>He</hi> to man himſelfe, that is, when God hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth pride from man, then man keepeth his ſoule from the pit, that is, thereby man is both admoniſhed and inſtructed how to keep his ſoule from the pit. <hi>They who avoyde the mountains and precipices of pride, are moſt aſſured of eſcaping a downe-fall into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Solomon</hi> tells us (<hi>Prov:</hi> 16.18.) <hi>Pride goeth before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and a high mind before a fall;</hi> ſuch a fall as <hi>Elihu</hi> here ſpeakes of, <hi>falling into the pit;</hi> therefore turning from pride is the eſcaping of the pit.</p>
                  <p>But rather (as moſt Interpreters) the relative <hi>(He)</hi> referrs to God himſelfe, who both begins and perfects this great worke of Grace; As he ſpeaketh with a purpoſe to withdraw man from his purpoſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo <hi>he</hi> having effectually withdrawne him from it, and hid pride from him, he thereby humbleth him in the duſt of repentance, and ſo keepeth back his ſoule from the pit.</p>
                  <p>The word rendred, <hi>keepeth back,</hi> notes a threefold keeping back; Firſt, by force, as a man holds another from falling into a pit, or running into danger; he holds him whether he will or no. Secondly, there is a holding or keeping back by perſwaſion or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, by ſeaſonable advice and counſel; ſo <hi>Abigail</hi> kept <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> from ſhedding blood (1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 25.) Thirdly, there is a hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or keeping back by authority, when a Command or an injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction forbids a man from going on, and ſo ſtops his proceeding. Thus we ſee there is a keeping back,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </note> either by outward force, or by counſel, or by command. And there is a keeping back ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to any of theſe three notions, two ways. Firſt, ſuch a keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, as hinders the very attempt, ſuch a keeping back, as ſtops the firſt motions, or ſtep into an undertaking. Secondly, there is a keeping back when a man is deeply engaged in an undertaking, when he is gone on and is neere the journeys end of his owne purpoſe. Thus <hi>David</hi> was kept back from deſtroying <hi>Nabal</hi> when he was far advanced in that enterpriſe; and <hi>Abimeleck</hi> was kept back from taking <hi>Sarah Abrahams</hi> wife when the matter had made a very great progreſs in his ſpirit. Both theſe wayes we may underſtand it here, though chieflly, I conceive, in the latter. Sometimes God keepeth man, either by his power, or by perſwaſions and commands ſent to him, from ſetting ſo much as one foot forward in any ſinfull way leading to the pit; yet often he ſuffers him to goe on a great way, and when he is advanced
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:104248:173"/> far towards, yea is near, very neer to the pits brink, even ready to drop into it, then, then the Lord graciouſly keeps his ſoule from falling into it. This word is uſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>in the negative twice to ſet forth the high commendation of <hi>Abraham</hi> (Gen. 22.12.16.) When God had commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer his Son, and he was ſo ready to doe it, that preſently God tells him, <hi>Now I know thou feareſt God, ſeeing thou haſt not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held</hi> (or kept back) <hi>thy ſon, thine only ſon from me. Abraham</hi> might have had many reaſonings within himſelfe to keep back and withhold his Son from being a Sacrifice, but, ſaith the Lord, <hi>thou haſt not withheld or kept him back;</hi> There the word is uſed in the negative, as alſo upon the ſame occaſion at the 16 verſe of the ſame Chapter. And ſo by <hi>Job (Chap.</hi> 7.11.) <hi>Therefore I will not refraine (or keep back) my mouth.</hi> It is as hard a matter to keep back, or hold the mouth in, as it is to keep back a head-ſtrong horſe with a bridle.

But ſaith <hi>Job, I will not refraine my mouth,</hi> I will not keep it back, let it take its courſe, <hi>I will ſpeak in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of my ſpirit.</hi> The word imports powerfull acting, take it either in the negative or affirmative. When the tongue is kept back, 'tis done by a mighty power of grace, and O how great as well as gracious is that power, which the Lord putteth forth to keep back a poor ſoul that is going, going apace too, from falling into the pit. <hi>He keepeth back</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But doth the ſoul fall into the pit? I anſwer, firſt, The ſoul is often in Scripture (by a Synecdoche) put for the whole man; <hi>He keepeth back his ſoul,</hi> that is, he keepeth him from the pit; ſecondly, poſſibly 'tis ſaid, <hi>he keepeth his ſoul from the pit,</hi> to teach us that man by running on in ſin, ruines his beſt part, it is not only his body, and his skin that he deſtroyeth by ſin, but his very ſoul. 'Tis a mercy that God telleth us aforehand the worſt of that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the greatneſſe of the hazard, or how great a matter we venture upon evill wayes and workes. <hi>He keepeth back his ſoul</hi>

We find the pit and deſtruction put together (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.23.) <hi>they ſhall goe to the pit of deſtruction;</hi> So then the ſame word may well ſerve to ſignifie a pit, corruption and death; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the pit dead bodies or carkaſſes putrifie and corrupt. Yet <hi>David</hi> prophecying of Chriſt ſpeaks his aſſurance of eſcaping corruption,<note place="margin">Videre foveam eſt amplius qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſepeliri, nimiru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ut is demum perfectè dicatur videre foveam, non qui ad tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus eſt, in fove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a, ſed qui ejus vim corruptri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem experitur, ſive videt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptionem in ea; videre e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim eſt ſentire ſive pati ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid. <hi>Coc.</hi>
                     </note> though not the pit or grave. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10.) <hi>Thou wilt not ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corruption, or the pit.</hi> It is this word; that is, <hi>thou</hi> wilt not ſuffer him to corrupt in the pit of the grave; though being dead was buried and laid in the pit, <hi>yet he did not ſee corruption in the pit.</hi> That is, corruption had no power, no maſtery over him; for he looſed the bonds of death (it being impoſſible that he ſhould be held by them) the third day, yea with the firſt of that day, or as ſoon as it might be truly ſaid that it was the third day; Chriſt was buryed in the latter part of the ſixth day of the week, and aroſe early the firſt day of the week, even when it <hi>did but begin to dawn towards the firſt day of the week.</hi> (Math. 28.1.) And therefore ſeeing as naturaliſts (according to Scripture evidence, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.39.) teſtifie corruption doth not naturally take hold of the body till the fourth day after death. The dead body of Chriſt was altogether free from corruption, or Chriſt (as was fore-ſhewed by <hi>David</hi> in the Pſalme) ſaw no corruption.</p>
                  <p>Further, this word <hi>pit,</hi> is taken not only for death, the grave, and corruption; but for thoſe contrivances and plots which are made and laid for any mans death or diſtruction. Thus <hi>David</hi> ſaid of

We have <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking againe under the ſame meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 9.15.) <hi>The Heathen are ſunk down in the pit that they made.</hi> And (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.7.) <hi>Without cauſe they have hid for me their net in a pit, which without cauſe have they digged for my ſoul;</hi> that is, they have laid a plot to undoe and deſtroy me. And if we take pit in this ſence it may hold well enough with the ſcope of the Text; for what is the pit, into which pride and evill purpoſes thruſt ſinfull man, but that miſchief and miſery which Satan is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually plotting againſt him? And from this miſchievous plot it is that God delivereth man, while 'tis ſaid by <hi>Elihu, he keepeth back</hi>

That bond or knot which ties ſoul and body together, is, properly, that which <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks of in the next words.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Lord withdraweth man from his purpoſe, and hides pride from man, that ſo he may in mercy preſerve him from periſhing both in body and ſoul, or that he may keep him not only from the firſt, but from the ſecond death, which is the ſeparation of the whole man from the bleſſed preſence of God for ever.</hi> 'Tis a great favour to be kept from the pit where the body corrupts, or from the ſword that
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:104248:175"/> wounds the fleſh, but to be kept from that everlaſting woe which ſhall overwhelme the wicked in that bottomleſſe pit or lake of fire and brimſtone, this is the higheſt favour of God to loſt man. This is the pit, this the periſhing <hi>from which</hi> (ſaith <hi>Elihu) the Lord keepeth back the ſoul and life of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, from the emphaſis of the word, <hi>he keepeth back,</hi> import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that God, as it were by ſtrong hand or abſolute authority and command, keepeth the ſoul of man from the pit.</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>Man is very forward to run upon his own ruine, even to run upon eternall ruine, if the Lord did not hold, ſtay, and ſtop him.</q>
                  <p>Man would tumble into the pit, at the very next ſtep, if God did not keep him. The way of man naturally is downe to the pit, and all that he doth of his own ſelf is for his own undoing: And as he is kept back from the pit, ſo (as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> hath it, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1.5.) <hi>he is kept by the power of God, through faith unto ſalvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, conſidering the ſeaſon ſignified in the former verſe, that when man is going upon an evill work, or walking in the pride of his heart, God is keeping him from the pit.</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>While man hath ſinfull purpoſes and pride in his heart, all that while he is going on to deſtruction, both temporall and eternall.</q>
                  <p>Every ſtep in ſin is a ſtep to miſery, and the further any man proceedeth on in ſin, the further he wanders from God; and the further he wanders from God, the neerer he comes to miſery. As the further we goe from the Sun, the neerer we are to the cold, and the further we go from the fountaine, the nearer we are to drought; ſo they that haſt to ſin, haſt to ſorrow, yea to hell. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of ſuch, they love death. There is no man loves death under the notion of death, there is no beauty, no amiableneſs in death; but all they may be ſaid to love death, who love ſin, and live in it. Every motion towards ſin, is a haſting into the armes and embraces of death, ſinners wooe and invite death and the grave, yea hell and deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, note.</p>
                  <q>The warnings and admonitions which God gives to ſinfull man, whether waking or ſleeping are to keep him from periſhing, to keep him from temporall, to keep him from eternall periſhing.</q>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:104248:176"/>
                  <p>This is the great end of preaching the Goſpel, the end alſo of preſſing the terrors of the Law; both have this aime to keep man from periſhing. When man is preſt to holineſſe, and when he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt from the wayes of ſin, 'tis that he may not periſh for ever. God hath ſet up many ordinances, he hath imployed many inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to adminiſter them; many thouſands goe up and downe preaching to the world, and crying out to the ſons of men, repent and beleeve, beleeve and repent; and why all this cry, but to keep ſouls from the pit, and their life from periſhing by the ſword? The Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> exhorts to <hi>ſave ſome with fear, and of others to have compaſſion,</hi> that is, terrifie ſome that you may ſave them, make them afraid that they may not be damned; <hi>ſave them with fear,</hi> plucking them as it were out of the fire. Sinners are run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the fire, and do not perceive it; they are tumbling down to hell and conſider it not; they muſt be pulled out of the fire, elſe they will burn in it for ever. The great buſineſſe of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is to pull ſouls like firebrands out of the burning.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, note.</p>
                  <q>They who turn from their evill purpoſes and the pride of their hearts, eſcape wrath, the pit, and the ſword.</q>
                  <p>The wages of ſin is death, and well are they that eſcape, that miſſe ſuch wages. If a ſinner turne from his purpoſe, from his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full way, if his pride be ſubdued and he emptied of himſelf, then <hi>his ſoul if kept from deſtruction, and his life from periſhing by the ſword.</hi>

                  </p>

Thus when Chriſt had finiſhed his Sermon on the mount, it is ſayd (<hi>Math:</hi> 7.28, 29.) <hi>The people</hi> (his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) <hi>were aſtoniſhed at his doctrine, for he taught them as one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving authority, and not as the Scribes.</hi> This Sermon carrying ſo great a reproofe of the Scribes and Phariſees, both as to their life and doctrine throughout, may well be expounded as a fullfilling of that ancient prophecy; It being confeſſed in another place of the Goſpel, even by the Officers that were ſent to attach him (<hi>John</hi> 7.46.) <hi>Never man ſpake like this man.</hi> The words of Chriſt had ſo much evidence, ſo much equity in them, that they who came to take and catch him, were taken and caught, if not to converſion, yet to ſuch a conviction, by what he ſpake, that they could not (though they highly diſpleaſed their Maſters in ſaying ſo) but ſay, <hi>Never man ſpake like this man;</hi> As if they had ſayd, <hi>Surely, the man that ſpeakes thus is more then a man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The word often ſignifies to correct, which is alſo to inſtruct; correction is for inſtruction. <hi>Chaſtning is the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reproving.</hi> And ſo we render it, <hi>He is chaſtened.</hi> Man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed not only by ſpeech and counſell, but by ſtripes and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. Thus <hi>David</hi> prayed (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 6.1.) <hi>O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chaſten me in thy hot diſpleaſure.</hi> The firſt word which we render <hi>rebuke,</hi> is that in the text; As if he had ſayd, <hi>Lord doe not rebuke me by angry afflictions, let me not find thee
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:104248:177"/> greatly diſpleaſed, and my ſelfe ſorely chaſtned at once.</hi> He depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the ſame againe, and how grievous the effects of ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations are, he ſheweth (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 38.1.) <hi>Rebuke me not in thy wrath.</hi> (Pſal: 39.11.) <hi>When thou with rebukes doſt correct man for iniquity;</hi> (He means it not only of word-rebukes, but of hand-rebukes alſo, when thou with ſuch doubled rebukes doſt chaſten man for iniquity) What then? The effects of it follow, even the ſtaining of the glory of all fleſh; <hi>Thou makeſt his beauty to conſume away like a moth.</hi> And ſo ſome interpret that (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 105.15.) <hi>He reproved Kings for their ſakes?</hi> (ſpeaking of his owne people) the Lord did not only ſpeak to thoſe Kings, but made them feel his hand, for his peoples ſake. <hi>Abimelech</hi> felt his hand for <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſake. And ſo did <hi>Pharoah</hi> that hard-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted King in a whole decade of plagues for <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſake, whom he had oppreſſed and would not let goe.

I inſiſt not upon that ſenſe, though it be a probable and a profitable one. But ſurely to ſay, <hi>A man is chaſtened with paine upon his bed,</hi> implyeth, the man to be in extraordinary pain; as to ſay, ſuch <hi>a man keepes his bed,</hi> implyeth, he hath more then an ordinary ſickneſs, or that he is very ſick. We have three expreſſions in our language gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſetting forth the ſickneſſe of a perſon; Firſt, we ſay, <hi>he keepes his houſe.</hi> He that is not well doth not goe abroad, ſickneſs hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him. Secondly, we ſay, <hi>he keepes his chamber;</hi> that's a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree, when ſickneſs hath brought a man up ſtaires, and ſhut him in his chamber, he is ſicke indeed. Thirdly, we ſay, ſuch <hi>a man keeps his bed;</hi> The meaning of which every one under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands to be, that he is dangerouſly or extreamly ſick. Thus when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>He is chaſtened with pain upon his bed;</hi> we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him ſo ill, that either he muſt not, or is not able to ſit up. And <hi>Elihu</hi> in ſpeaking thus, ſeemes to have relation to what <hi>Job</hi> had ſayd (<hi>Chap:</hi> 7.13.) <hi>When I ſayd my bed ſhall comfort me, and my couch ſhall eaſe my complaint; Then thou ſcareſt me with dreames, and terrifiest me through viſions.</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>O Job, thou indeed haſt had recourſe heretofore, to thy bed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing and comfort, in ſilent meditations and ſoliloquies with God, but he terrified thee with dreames, and ſpake to thee by ſcaring viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to turne thee from thy purpoſe. And not only ſo, but finding thee deafe to thoſe admonitions, or not regarding them, yea ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing thy unquiet murmurings, he hath now even made thee bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, or unable to riſe from thy bed.</hi> Though <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpake here in the third perſon, yet in all his ſpeech he intended and poynted at, yea ſet forth and poynted out <hi>Jobs</hi> condition. <hi>He is chaſtened with paines upon his bed,</hi>

                  <p>The word <hi>paine,</hi> is not expreſs'd in the latter part of the verſe; the Hebrew is, <hi>The multitude of his bones with ſtrong paine.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Broughton</hi> renders thus, <hi>And all his bones with a ſore one.</hi> The word which we tranſlate <hi>ſtrong,</hi> ſignifieth two things; Firſt, as we render, <hi>ſtrength or might</hi> (Pſal: 74.15.) <hi>Thou driedst up mighty rivers;</hi> God dryed up the river <hi>Jordan</hi> for his people to paſſe through, yea and the red Sea.

So ſome render that place in the Pſalmes, not <hi>ſtrong or mighty rivers,</hi> but <hi>he dryed up everlaſting or perpetuall rivers,</hi> ſuch as had alwayes run with a full ſtreame, and were not like thoſe deceitfull brookes (ſpoken of in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap: of this book (<hi>v.</hi> 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) to which <hi>Job</hi> compared his Brethren) which in winter over-flow the bankes, but in ſummer, <hi>what time

The man is ſo ſick that he hath no good houres, no comfortable intermiſſions, his paine continueth. And becauſe the word <hi>paine</hi> is not in the text, therefore it hath cauſed ſeverall rendrings of theſe words, yet all meeting in the ſame ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some joyne the word <hi>ſtrong</hi> to <hi>bone,</hi> or make it an epe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thite of the mans bones. <hi>Though the multitude of his bones be ſtrong,</hi> that is, though he were once a ſtrong man, ſound and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect all over, or as we ſay, <hi>ſound wind and limbe,</hi> not crazy, not having the leaſt flaw in him, yet he is chaſtened all over with paine.</p>

Broken bones cauſe the acuteſt paines, but decaying bones the moſt conſtant paine. Withering bones are oppoſed to fatned bones in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to him that faſts ſpiritually, not carnally only in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from fleſh (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.11.) <hi>The Lord will make fat thy bones;</hi> As if he had ſayd, Doe not feare that thou ſhalt pine by ſpirituall faſting, I will make fat thy bones. Which is true even in regard of that which is naturall, the Lord reneweth bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrength to thoſe who humble themſelves ſoule and body. The body ſhall not ſuffer in this ſervice of the Lord, if the ſoule be truly afflicted in it. Yet when he ſaith, <hi>he will make fat thy bones,</hi> it reſpects eſpecially their ſpirituall ſtrength, that thrives beſt in a day of holy abſtinence and faſting. Here, when 'tis ſayd,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:104248:179"/> 
                     <hi>their bones ſhall wither through paine,</hi> it notes the declining of the whole body, becauſe as the bones are ſtrong in themſelves, ſo they are the ſtrength and ſupport of the whole outward man. When God ſmites the bones, then he ſhakes the pillars and raf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our earthly houſe, and threatens the downfall of it. <hi>He is chaſtened with paine upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with ſtrong pain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Taking theſe words in connection with the former, where <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi> ſpake of thoſe dreames and viſions by which God ſpeakes to man, and ſuppoſing (as there he doth) that becauſe the man is not well awakened by thoſe dreames and viſions from his ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, therefore the Lord ſendeth pain and ſickneſs upon him, as a ſecond meanes to humble him, and make him underſtand him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>They that will not be inſtructed by dreames, that is, by gentler meanes, ſhall be inſtructed by paines.</q>
                  <p>They who will not take inſtruction, even in their ſleep, ſhall be taught by that, which will keep them awake. Severall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures tell us of the Lords proceeding with man from words to blowes. And if the Lord proceeds from dreames (which are warnings in ſleepe) to blowes, if when he hath ſpoken to us in a dreame, we hearken not, he will chaſten us with paine, even the multitude of our bones with ſtrong paine. And then much more will he proceed from words to blows with them that are warned to awake, if they heare not and take warning. That's an awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing word to thoſe who ſleepe waking (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 7.12, 13.) <hi>If he turn not he will whet his ſword: He bath bent his bowe and made it ready.</hi> If men will not returne upon word-admonition and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, the Lord hath his arrowes and his ſword to reprove them with. <hi>Turne ye at my reproofe,</hi> ſaith the Lord (<hi>Pro:</hi> 1.23.) I give you warning to turne, but if you doe not, then (as preſently it followeth) <hi>I will laugh at your calamity, and mock when your feare cometh.</hi> As you have ſeemed to mock at my counſels, ſo I will mock at your calamities, that is, I will ſhew you no pity, as you have ſhewed me no reſpect. Thus the Lord deales with proud rebellious man, who caſts off his yoake, yea ſometimes he deales very ſeverely with his owne people (for they may put him
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:104248:180"/> to it) if words will not ſerve their turne (words in ſleepe, and words when awake) they may expect blowes next; and be made to feele the hand of God, becauſe they have not underſtood or not obeyed his will.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the manner of expreſſion, <hi>He is chaſtened with paine upon his bed.</hi> The Spirit of God uſeth a word referring to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction both by ſmiting and ſpeaking, to ſhew that there is a voyce in the rod.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>The chaſtiſements of God upon us are our documents.</q>
                  <p>When God ſends ſickneſſe and grievous paines, he reproves ſinners from Heaven and chides them for the errours of their lives. The chaſtenings of the Lord are ſpeakings. He ſpeaketh by his rods beyond all the eloquence of words (<hi>Mic.</hi> 6.9.) <hi>Hear ye the rod.</hi> The voyce of God is in his rod; that ſpeaks ſo loud from Heaven in many ſtroaks, that the prophaneſt ſinners on earth are ſometimes forced to heare and acknowledge it. As thoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians were forced by the plaine evidence of the fact to ſay (<hi>Ez.</hi> 8.19.) <hi>This is the finger of God;</hi> So they muſt ſay, <hi>This is the voyce of God.</hi> He ſpeaks to us, and ſpeaks to purpoſe in theſe afflictions: The voyce of God in affliction, exceeds all the rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick and perſwaſions of mortall-men. The croſſe is a ſchoole, in which they who are dull at hearing what God ſpeaks to them in his word, are wonderfully quickened up by his rod. <hi>The words of the wiſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) are goads.</hi> And ſurely theſe goads of affliction are pricking piercing words, for the promoting and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on of a lazy ſoul in Gods worke. <hi>Job</hi> had deſired God to ſpeak with him, <hi>Elihu</hi> anſwers, Why doſt thou deſire more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers or directions from God? Hath not God ſpoken to thee in theſe ſoares and ſickneſſes, in theſe chaſtiſements, with pain upon thy bed? Is God wanting to thy inſtruction? hath he not clearly told thee his mind and thy duty? hath he not written, yea engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his will upon thy diſeaſed fleſh? What are the paines, the corruption, the conſumption, the ſtrange deformity, and ſad tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration of thy body, but as ſo many voyces of God, ſpeaking and ſpeaking aloud to thee, repent and humble thy ſelfe? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore attend, hearken to and meditate upon the anſwers which he hath impreſſed or printed legibly upon thy head, face, and wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:104248:180"/> forehead. Thou haſt his anſwer his own way, therefore be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and doe not ſtand defiring that God would anſwer thee after thy way, nor complaining becauſe he doth not. And we may reply not only to obſtinate ſinners, but to many of the people of God, when they enquire what the mind of God is, or what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends towards them. His providences give you many items and memorandums; which if you can ſpell out and read you may know his meaning. This leſſon, the ſignification of the word offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth us as the connection of the words offered in the former.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, learne hence.</p>
                  <q>Man is a poor crazy creature ſubject to all diſeaſes and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</q>
                  <p>Yea, he is not only ſubject to them, but he is the ſubject of them. His body is as it were a veſſell of naturall corruption, as his ſoul is a veſſell of morall corruption. Man is called not only <hi>Adam,</hi> noting the matter of which he was made, <hi>earth, red earth;</hi> but he is called <hi>Enoſh,</hi> that is, ſorrowfull, ſighing, groaning man, he is a pined and a pining man: He is alſo called <hi>Abel,</hi> vanity, a poor vain man; which two latter Titles have befallen man ſince man fell from God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, (which may check the groſſe Atheiſme of many)</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Pain and ſickneſſe come not by chance, nor are we to ſtay in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the cauſe of their coming.</q>
                  <p>They come not at all by chance, nor doe they come altogether from naturall cauſes. Nature hath ſomewhat to doe in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ſomewhat elſe much more, even ſo much more, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that, naturall conſiderations may be quite ſhut out, and the whole cauſe aſcribed to that. But what is that? ſurely, nothing elſe but, and nothing leſſe then the will of God. He is pleaſed to give commiſſion to pains and ſickneſſes, and then they come. <hi>Elihu</hi> would teach <hi>Job</hi> (what he owned before) that God was the ſender and orderer of all his afflictions, as of the loſſes he had in his eſtate and children, ſo of the pains and ſickneſſes which he felt in his body. <hi>Moſes</hi> tells the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not only that ſword and captivity, but the Peſtilence, Conſumptions, Feavers, and burning Agues are ſent by God himſelf, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 28.21, 22.)
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:104248:181"/> What are diſeaſes but the Lords Meſſengers? When he pleaſeth he can trouble the temper and cauſe the humours of the body to corrupt. He can make them contend with one another to the death, let Phyſitians doe what they can to quiet and pacifie them. Yea though ſome skillfull Phyſitians have kept their own bodies in ſo due a temper, and to ſo exact a diet, that they could not ſee which way a diſeaſe could take hold of them, or have any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt them, yet ſickneſſe hath come upon them like an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med man, and carryed them away to the grave.</p>
                  <p>Further, When <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith of the ſick man, <hi>the multitude of his bones are chaſtened with ſtrong paine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>No man is ſo ſtrong, but the Lord is able to bring him down by pain and ſickneſſe.</q>
                  <p>He that is ſtrong as an Oake, and hath (as it were) a body of braſſe and ſinews of iron; yet the Lord can make him as weak as water. The Lord hath ſtrong pains for ſtrong men, and can quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turne our ſtrength into weakneſſe. Thus <hi>Hezekiah</hi> lamented in his ſickneſſe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.13.) <hi>I reckoned till morning that as a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo will he break all my bones.</hi> God can arme diſeaſes with the ſtrength of a Lion, who not only teareth the fleſh, but breaketh the bones with his teeth. <hi>David</hi> ſaith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.11.) <hi>When thou with rebukes doſt correct man for iniquity, thou makeſt his beauty to conſume away like a moth, ſurely every man is vanity.</hi> The word there rendred <hi>beauty</hi> ſignifieth <hi>deſire,</hi>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>dneſs</hi> (ſaith the Lord of his ſore Judgements brought upon his people <hi>Iſrael</hi> (Jer: 4.18.) <hi>Becauſe it is bitter.</hi> Ye would not taſte the evill or bitterneſs of ſin by inſtruction, therefore I will teach you by affliction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To put ſorrowfull ſinfull man upon the ſearch of his owne heart, and the finding out of the errour of his wayes. While men are ſtrong and healthfull, they ſeldome find leiſure for that worke. And therefore they are confined by ſickneſs to their houſes, to their chambers, yea to their beds, that they may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, and read over the whole book of their lives (<hi>Lam:</hi> 3.39, 40.) <hi>Wherefore doth the living man complain, a man for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſin; Let us ſearch and try our wayes, and turne to the Lord.</hi> That's mans worke upon his bed, and 'tis Gods aime in binding him to his bed, that he may have liberty for that worke.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Afflictions are deſign'd by God to bring man out of love with ſin, yea to ſtirre up a holy hatred and revenge in him againſt it; as upon many other accounts, ſo upon this, becauſe it rewardeth him ſo ill, and he finds ſuch unſavoury fruits of it. A little digging will diſcover ſin to be the roote of all thoſe evill and bitter fruits, which we at any time are fed with in this world. Sin is the gall in our cup, and the gravel in our bread, and we are made to taſte bitterneſs and finde trouble, that we may both know and acknowledge it to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The purpoſe of God in afflicting us, is to ſet us a praying to and ſeeking after him. We ſeldome know our need
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:104248:182"/> of him, till we feele it. (<hi>Hoſ:</hi> 5.15.) <hi>In their affliction they will ſeek me early;</hi> affliction puts man upon ſupplication, yet every man who is afflicted, doth not preſently ſeek God (many in their affliction mind not God, they ſeek to men, not to God, a croſſe without a Chriſt, never made any ſeek God) but affliction through the workings of the Spirit of Chriſt, is a meanes to bring the ſoule to God; and we ſee the effect of it at the beginning of the next Chapter in the ſame Prophet (<hi>Hoſ:</hi> 6.1.) <hi>Come let us return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, for he hath torn, and he will heale us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, God is pleaſed to exerciſe us with croſſes, for the exerciſe of our Graces, or to ſet grace aworke; Grace hath moſt buſineſſe to doe when we are taken off from all worldly buſineſs, and are layd upon our bed, our ſick-bed. Some worke is not done ſo well any where elſe, as there. And many graces worke beſt when 'tis worſt with us; they would even ſtand ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ll, and have nothing to doe, if God did not bring us into ſtraights, or keep us for a ſeaſon in them. In a ſick-bed the Lord ſhews us, and we may find work enough for all our graces, eſpecially for faith and patience, and ſubmiſſion of ſpirit to his worke and will. We may doe better worke (and doe it better) in ſickneſs then in health.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, God brings many upon their fick-beds, to teach them the worth of health, and make them thankfull for it. They who are ſeldome ſicke, are as ſeldome thankfull for their health, and ſcarce reckon that for a mercy, the want whereof, they have never felt. 'Tis rare that we prize what we have, till we have it not.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, God exerciſeth many with ſickneſs, with a purpoſe to put men upon a holy purpoſe of improving their health better, and of doing more for God while 'tis well with them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, not a few are afflicted, that God may have an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to doe his worke, and declare his power. God himſelf would be hindred of much glorious work, in reſtoring and recovering them to health, did he not chaſten them upon ſick beds. The queſtion was put about the blind man (<hi>Joh.</hi> 9.3, 4.) <hi>Who did ſin, this man or his Parents that he was born blind.</hi> Jeſus anſwered neither hath this man ſinned nor his Parents, <hi>but that the works of God ſhould be made manifeſt in him.</hi> If there had not been a blind man in the world, how could the power of God have been made manifeſt in giving ſight to the blind? if ſome were not extreamly
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:104248:182"/> torturingly ſick, how would the power of God be ſeene in heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſicke, and rebuking their paine? For all theſe purpoſes, <hi>Man is chaſtened with paine upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with ſtrong paine.</hi> We never profit by chaſtenings, till we anſwer the purpoſes of God in ſending them, and unleſs we know what and which they are, we can never anſwer them. If we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer theſe nine toucht upon, we ſhall either anſwer all, or, to be ſure, we ſhall baulke or refuſe none. <hi>Elihu</hi> having thus ſhewed us the ſicke man in paine, proceeds to ſhew us what further effect his paine and ſickneſs wrought upon him.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>Meat of deſire.</hi> Not only ſuch meat, as men uſually deſire for the wholeſomneſſe of it, but ſuch as curious palates deſire for the pleaſantneſs of it; ſuch meat is here meant; Yea thirdly, ſuch meat as the man had a deſire to before his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for the ſutableneſs of it to his owne taſte and appetite, he then abhorreth.</p>
                  <q>His ſoule abhorreth dainty meat.</q>
                  <p>The turning of the ſtomack, and loſſe of appetite, are uſuall ſymptomes of ſickneſs; Almoſt all ſickneſſes weaken the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and ſome take it quite away, ſo that the patient not only hath no deſire to, but <hi>loathes dainty meate, or meate of deſire.</hi> This phraſe or forme of ſpeaking is uſed (<hi>Dan:</hi> 10.3.) <hi>I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ate no pleaſant bread, or no bread of deſires</hi> (as we put in the margin) <hi>neither came fleſh nor wine in my mouth.</hi> 'Tis uſed againe (2 <hi>Chro:</hi> 32.27.) <hi>Hezekiah made himſelfe treaſuries for ſilver and gold,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and all manner of pleaſant jewells;</hi> we put in the Margin, <hi>for all jewells of deſire.</hi> So (<hi>Amos</hi> 5.11.) <hi>Pleaſant vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, or vineyards of deſire.</hi> It was the manner of the Hebrews to expreſſe <hi>pleaſant</hi> by <hi>deſirable,</hi> becauſe pleaſant things are much deſired. <hi>His ſoule abhorreth meate of deſire, or dainty meate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'Tis a mercy to taſt our meat, or to take the comfort of what we eate.</q>
                  <p>Many have meat, but cannot taſte it. That which giveth the beſt taſte to our meat, is a taſte of the goodneſſe of God in it (1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 2.1.) <hi>If ye have taſted that the Lord is gracious.</hi> It is ſweet to taſte meat and the goodneſſe of the Lord together.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>God can quickly make thoſe things that are moſt deſirable to us, dainty meat, meat of deſire, loathſome to us.</q>
                  <p>Some abhor meat, becauſe they have eaten of it long. The <hi>Jewes</hi> did eate Manna and Quailes till they loathed them (<hi>Num:</hi> 11.20.) Others loath meat, becauſe they have eaten over-much. A third ſort, loath ſome meat by a naturall antipathy againſt it.
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:104248:183"/> Fourthly, Others loath wholſome meat out of a curioſity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not dainty enough. Laſtly, Sickneſs cauſeth a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all meate, even of the moſt dainty and deſirable meate. And the Lord at any time can make that which was our deſire, our loathing. We have a like deſcription of a ſick man (<hi>Pſ:</hi> 107.18.) <hi>His ſoule abhorreth all manner of meat, and draweth neere unto the gates of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>The beſt of Creature-comforts are but vaine comforts.</q>
                  <p>What can dainty meat doe a man good, when he is ſicke and ready to dye? Then gold and ſilver, lands and houſes, which are the dainty meat of a covetous man, are loathſome to him. When a man is ſicke to death, his very riches are ſapleſs and taſtleſs to him; wife and children, friends and acquaintance can yeild little comfort in that dark houre, yea they often prove miſerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters: When we have moſt need of comfort, theſe things ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter leaſt or no comfort at all to us. Is it not our wiſdome then to get a ſtock of ſuch comforts, as will hold and abide freſh with us, when all worldly comforts either leave us, or become taſtleſs to us? Is it not good to get a ſtore of that food, which how ſick ſoever we are, our ſtomacks will never loath? yea the ſicker we are, our ſoules will the more like, hunger after, and feed the more heartily upon. <hi>The fleſh of Chriſt is meat indeed</hi> (Joh: 6.55.) Feed upon him by faith, in health and in ſickneſſe, ye will never loath him. His fleſh is the true meat of deſires, ſuch meat as will fill and fatten us, but never cloy us. A hungry craving appetite after Chriſt, and ſweet ſatisfaction in him are inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſtill the ſtronger is our appetite, the greater is our ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. And (which is yet a greater happineſs) our ſoules will have the ſtrongeſt appetite, the moſt ſharp-ſet ſtomacke after Chriſt, when, through bodily ſickneſs, our ſtomacks cannot take down, but loath the very ſcent and ſight of the moſt pleaſant pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing meate, and delicious earthly dainties. Looke, that ye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ſomewhat to eat, that will goe downe upon a ſick-bed; your ſick bed meat is Chriſt; all other dainty food may be an abhorring to you.</p>
                  <p>Further, Not only are we to conſider the ſickneſs of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as the cauſe of this taſtleſneſs and liſtleſneſs after bread. But
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:104248:184"/> we are to conſider the ſick man <hi>abhorring dainty meate,</hi> under the hideings of Gods face, or in feares about his ſpirituall ſtate; as appeares by that which followeth, <hi>If there be a meſſenger with him, an interpreter, one of a thouſand, to ſhew unto man his uprightneſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> or to ſet him right in his ſpirituall ſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſick man for want of that as well as for want of health, can taſte no ſweetneſs in the rareſt dainties.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>A ſenſe of divine diſpleaſure, or the hideing of divine favour from the ſoule, renders all outward comforts comfortleſſe to us.</q>
                  <p>If a man have never ſo much health, yet the appearances of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine diſpleaſure will make him ſick of his moſt pleaſant things. Carnall men can eat and drink, and live upon pleaſures, yea upon the pleaſures of ſin, and goe on merrily with them a while, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know not the meaning of the diſpleaſure of God, nor doe they know what the favour of God meaneth; they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not what they want, yea they flatter themſelves that they have enough, and are well enough, though they have nothing, and are nothing, that is of any worth. But if God once awaken them out of this dreame, and ſhew them their curſed condition, all will be gall and wormwood to their taſte, or as gravel between their teeth. As the ſenſe of divine favour makes bitter things ſweet, and ſorrowfull things comfortable to us, the ſoure herbs of affliction dainties to us; So not only common but dainty meat, all the cates and viands of this world will be not only taſtleſs but bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to us when God frownes upon us. An earneſt in the love and favour of God is the good of all good things.</p>
                  <p>For the cloſe of all, take theſe two Counſells, upon the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Receive your bread and dainty meate with prayer and thankeſgiving;</hi> you may quickly elſe come to abhorre your bread, yea and your dainties. The word and prayer both ſanctifie and ſweeten all creature-enjoyments.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take heed of abuſing your meate; ye may quickly be brought to a loathing of it. When they who have given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to luxury and intemperance lye upon their ſick-beds and find their ſtomacke turned from all their dainties, it will be moſt grievous to them to conſider how they have abuſed their
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:104248:184"/> dainties to feed their luſts. As ſome who abuſe the creatures are puniſhed with the want of them, ſo others with an abhorrence and loathing of them.</p>
                  <p>So much for this ſecond ſymptome of ſickneſs, <hi>His life abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth bread, and his ſoul dainty meat.</hi> The third followeth, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the generall decay and languiſhment of the ſick mans body.</p>

                  <q>His fleſh is conſumed away.</q>
                  <p>As if he had ſayd, Before his ſickneſſe he was full of fleſh, fat and faire, but falling into ſickneſs, he falls away, and is worne, (as we ſay) to skin and bones; <hi>his fleſh is conſumed.</hi> Fleſh, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is taken two wayes.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, Improperly, and Tropically.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, Literally or Properly.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>In a Tropicall and Improper ſenſe, <hi>fleſh</hi> ſignifieth our ſinfull corruption (<hi>Gal:</hi> 5.17.) <hi>The fleſh evermore luſteth againſt the ſpirit,</hi> that is, the unregenerate part in man againſt the regenerate.
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:104248:185"/> Theſe two are always contending and combating with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all thoſe whom Chriſt hath conquered to himſelfe. Happy are they that finde their fleſh, in this ſenſe, conſuming away; and 'tis that which every man is ſtudying (who knows what godlineſſe meanes) the conſumption of this fleſh, even the mortification of his luſts, of pride and earthlineſs, of wrath, envie, and unbeliefe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, fleſh by a figure is put for the whole naturall body, conſiſting of many parts diſſimilar to fleſh. Thus the Pſalmiſt complained in prayer, that, <hi>the Lord had given the fleſh of his Saints, to the beaſts of the earth</hi> (Pſal. 79.2.) that is, he had expoſed their bodies, through the rage and cruelty of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to the teeth and bowells of ſavage and ravenous beaſts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, fleſh is alſo put for the whole man conſiſting both of ſoul and body. (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.12, 13.) <hi>The Lord ſaw that all fleſh had corrupted their wayes.</hi> That is, all men (who are made up of a body and ſoul) had corrupted their wayes by letting looſe and acting their ſinfull corruptions.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, fleſh is ſometimes put for that which is b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſt in man, his greateſt naturall perfections, whatſoever in him is leſſe then grace, whatſoever is higheſt in him, below the ſpirit, is called fleſh in Scripture. When <hi>Peter (Math.</hi> 16.17.) had made that bleſſed confeſſion which is the rock upon which the Church is built <hi>(thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God)</hi> preſently Chriſt tells him <hi>fleſh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee,</hi> that is, the higheſt, and the moſt perfect piece of nature hath not taught thee this leſſon; the Evangeliſt ſaith of all true beleevers (who have received this power (or priviledge) to become the ſons of God) <hi>they are borne not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh</hi> (Joh. 1.13.) that is, the beſt of the creature, contributes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the bringing forth of new creatures, the ſons of God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, fleſh by a figure is put for all that in religion, or in the worſhip of God, which is outward, or open to the eye; whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver comes under any humane obſervation, is but the fleſh of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or the fleſh of worſhip. In this ſence the Apoſtle puts the queſtion (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1.) <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the fleſh, hath found?</hi> What he means by the fleſh, he tells us in the next words, <hi>he was not juſtified by works,</hi> that is, not by any thing that did appeare, not by any thing done to him or done by him. He was not juſtified by Circumciſion, or
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:104248:185"/> by the uſe of any externall rite, he was not juſtified by his own righteouſneſs, or obedience to the Law. The ſame Apoſtle alſo calls the very worſhip of the Goſpell, as to the outward part of it, <hi>fleſh (Phil.</hi> 3.3.) <hi>For we are the Circumciſion, which worſhip God in the Spirit, and rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> That is, in any outward work, or priviledge which we have in our Goſpell ſtate. All this fleſh likewiſe ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in our apprehenſions, that is, we muſt make nothing of it, nor reckon it any thing in our account for juſtification in the ſight of God or acceptance with him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Fleſh properly taken is that integrall and ſimilar part of the body, which is oppoſed to blood and bones, to veins and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news. When <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith <hi>his fleſh is conſumed,</hi> we are to underſtand it either in this proper ſence, or in the ſecond figurative ſence before named, as fleſh is put for the whole body; <hi>his fleſh is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,</hi> that is, his fleſh in oppoſition to his bones ſpoken of before, or his fleſh that is his outward man
<q>Is conſumed.</q>

As a tyrannicall oppreſſor eates out the people under his government, in which ſence this word is applyed (<hi>Dan.</hi> 7.25.) Or as a garment is worn out by time and uſing. The fleſh is often in Scripture compared to a garment, and dying to uncloathing; becauſe when we dye we put off the fleſh. The garment of the fleſh, that beautifull garment waxeth old and weares out apace on a ſick bed. Sickneſſe not only ſtaineth
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:104248:186"/> and abateth the beauty of it, but waſteth it deeply, ſo that, as it followeth
<q>it cannot be ſeene;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or as Mr <hi>Broughton</hi> renders, <hi>his fleſh waſteth away from ſight,</hi> or he hath no fleſh left to be ſeene.</p>
                  <p>Againe, When it is ſayd, <hi>his fleſh is conſumed away that it cannot be ſeene,</hi> ſome expound it thus; <hi>His fleſh is ſo conſumed away, that the ſeer withdraweth from it;</hi> or no man cares to ſee it, that is, the ſick man is ſo diſcoloured and waſted, that viſiters and ſpectators ſtart and are almoſt frighted to looke upon him. The fleſh of man in a healthfull and flouriſhing condition, is a lovely ſpectacle, and draws beholders, but the fleſh of a very ſick man is a gaſtly ſpectacle and a regreet to the beholder. We love not to ſee that which we doe not like. Beauty attracts, deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty withdrawes the eye. It is ſayd of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe,</hi> that he was ſo deformed by his ſufferings (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 52.14.) that <hi>many were aſtoniſh'd at him (his viſſage was ſo marred more then any man, and his forme more then the ſons of men)</hi> and (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 53.3.) <hi>We hid as it were our faces from him, he was deſpiſed and we eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him not;</hi> that is, he was ſo diſ-figured by ſorrow, that no man cared to look upon him. Thus 'tis often with the ſick. And this is a profitable and a probable ſenſe of the text in hand; <hi>His fleſh is conſumed away,</hi> and then he who before delighted to ſee it, is troubled at the ſight of it, or is rather affrighted then pleaſed in ſeeing it.</p>

                     </note>There is yet a fourth reading, which further aggravates the ſick mans conſumption; <hi>His fleſh is conſumed in ſight;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, his fleſh doth conſume ſo faſt, that a man may almoſt ſee him conſume; as we ſay of ſome plants, they grow ſo faſt, that we may, almoſt, ſee them grow; ſo we may ſay of thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and fade much, we may ſee them conſume, their fleſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth even to the eye or to view. He that lookes ſtedfaſtly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, may ſee them fade and wither like a flower, yea they ſeeme to fade by his looking or fixing his eye on them.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The fleſh of man is a very fading and declining thing.</q>
                  <p>It quickly conſumes and drips away in a diſeaſe; A violent feaver or any other acute diſeaſe, dries up the ſpirits, and drinkes
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:104248:186"/> up the moyſture, and how ſoone doth ſuch a man decay! and as the extremity of a diſeaſe, ſo extreame want of food or famine conſumes the fleſh. Hunger having nothing to eate, feeds upon the fleſh of the hungry, till all be eaten up. We read (<hi>Lam:</hi> 4.8.) how rudely famine dealt with the fleſh of thoſe delicate <hi>Nazarites, who were purer then ſnow, whiter then milke, they were more ruddy in body then rubyes, their poliſhing was of Saphire;</hi> yet the next words tell us, <hi>Their viſage is blacker then a coale, they are not knowne in the ſtreets, their skin cleaveth to their bones: it is withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it is become like a ſticke.</hi> And though a man eſcape ſickneſſe, and famine doth not eate up his fleſh, yet time (that great eater) will, old age will waſt what famine and ſickneſſe have not toucht. As the Prophet threatned, what the Caterpillar hath left, the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker-worme ſhall devoure; ſo what ſickneſſe leaves, time will certainly conſume. Thus bodily fleſh is every way liable to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; and therefore the Prophet being commanded to cry, and putting the queſtion, what ſhall I cry, had this anſwer, <hi>All fleſh is graſſe.</hi> (There indeed <hi>fleſh</hi> is taken in the moſt comprehenſive notion, as to all externalls; not only the fleſh of the body, but all the riches, honours, and dignities of this world, come under the name of fleſh there) <hi>All fleſh is graſſe</hi> (Iſa: 40.6.) But why doth he call it graſſe? 'Tis ſo under a two-fold conſideration. Firſt, for the greeneneſſe and faireneſſe of it. God hath put beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon this fading fleſh, both for the comfort, and for the tryall of man; that fleſh is faire as a flower, is matter of delight; and to abſtract our thoughts or weane our hearts from that which is faire and delightfull, is matter of tryall. How hardly are we taken off from affecting fleſh, our owne or others, while this graſſe continues beautifull and greene! Secondly, Fleſh is graſſe, becauſe ſoone gone (as it followeth in the Prophet) <hi>The graſſe withereth and the flower fadeth, becauſe the Spirit of the Lord</hi> (or his <hi>breath</hi> like a blaſting Eaſt winde) <hi>bloweth upon it;</hi> Which yet ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound more ſpiritually, of the Spirit of God diſcovering the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and mutability of all earthly things to the ſoule, for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently cauſeth the gayeſt and beſt of them to wither or be as a withered flower before our eyes. In which ſenſe <hi>David</hi> ſayd (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 119.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>6.) <hi>I have ſeene an end of all perfection.</hi> Take fleſh in the largeſt ſenſe, and 'tis a conſuming thing; <hi>The faſhion</hi> (or ſcheame) <hi>of the world paſſeth away,</hi> and ſo doth the faſhion of all
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:104248:187"/> thoſe perfections, or moſt perfect enjoyments, which are but of a worldly birth and extraction. Fleſh under every forme is a fading thing, eſpecially the fleſh of the beſt-form'd face &amp; body of man. Whence take theſe ſix inferences. If the fleſh the faireſt outſide of man be a fading thing, then</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Be not deſirous, much leſſe ambitious, <hi>to make a faire ſhew in the fleſh;</hi> for it may prove but a vaine ſhew, and at laſt, not ſo much as a ſhew. Fleſh may ſo conſume away, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeene. When the Apoſtle tells us of ſome, <hi>who deſire to make a faire ſhew in the fleſh</hi> (Gal: 6.12.) he ſpecially meanes it of thoſe that brave it and boaſt themſelves in the outward part of religion, and would appeare much in the forme; <hi>'Tis a moſt vaine thing to deſire, to make a faire ſhew in the fleſh of ſpirituall things, as hypocrites and formaliſts doe;</hi> And 'tis a very vaine thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to make a faire ſhew in the fleſh of corporall things, as proud and vain-glorious men love to doe. Many deſire to make a faire ſhew in the fleſh of their bodyes, they love to have faire faces, and faire skins, to be fairely dreſt and deckt, is a great part of their care. But take heed of deſiring to make a faire ſhew in this or in any thing that is called fleſh. For when you have done all, fleſh will be a nothing; And after you have beſtowed much coſt upon the fleſh of this body, that it may be ſeene, a ſickneſs may come and conſume it, that it cannot be ſeene.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take heed of priding your ſelves in the fleſh, when your fleſh (poſſibly unſought by you) makes a faire ſhew; Though you have beauty, and the goodlieſt ſtructure of body that ever was ſeene, though you have riches and honour, the higheſt built eſtate that ever was enjoyed, what have you to be proud of? will it not conſume and moulder away? may it not melt like a ſnow-ball, or like wax before the fire? be not proud of any thing called fleſh, how goodly a ſight ſoever it is to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> world, for in a little, in a very little time, there may be nothing of fleſh left in ſight. <hi>His fleſh is conſumed away, that it cannot be ſeene.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Be not over-carefull to provide for your fleſh, the outward man, this body, or any thing that concernes it. As the Apoſtle utterly forbids us to <hi>make proviſion for the fleſh, to fullfill the lusts thereof</hi> (Rom: 13.14.) that is, thoſe luſts that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the fleſh; ſo, be not much carefull, not at all unduely
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:104248:187"/> carefull to make proviſion for your fleſh, to ſatisfie the neceſſities of it; for 'tis but a periſhing thing. Be not carefull what you ſhall eate and drinke, and wherewith you ſhall be clothed, as Chriſt himſelfe adviſeth (<hi>Math:</hi> 6.) The fleſh that you prepare for your fleſh, is not more periſhing then the fleſh for which it is prepared. <hi>Meates for the belly and the belly for meates, but God ſhall deſtroy both it and them</hi> (1 Cor: 6.13.) It will not be long before there ſhall be an end both of the meate that is eaten, and of eating meate.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If the fleſh may ſoone be ſo conſumed by the hand of God that it cannot be ſeene, then be not unwilling to waſt and conſume your fleſh which is ſeen in working for God, or in doing good worke, which is the worke of God: your fleſh may conſume upon worſe termes quickly, then working for God, why then ſhould you be unwilling to conſume it in Gods worke? Are not ſome ſo tender of their carkaſſe, and their skin, that they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid (though that feare be their ſhame and ſin) of taking too much paines in the worke of God, leſt they ſhould dammage their bodyes, endanger their health, and conſume their fleſh? This fleſh will waſt with idleneſs, is it not better to waſt it by induſtry in uſefull ſervices? The Apoſtle was willing <hi>to ſpend and be ſpent</hi> in the ſervice of the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> That is, he was willing to ſpend not only his purſe and his paines, but to be ſpent as to his bodyly ſtrength, health and life. He cared not for his owne fleſh, ſo he might be ſerviceable to their ſpirits, and promote their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good, (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 12.15.)</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Be not unwilling to waſte and conſume your fleſh in duty with God; as the fleſh conſumes in work for God, ſo in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with God, in prayer and faſting and ſelfe-humbling, theſe are duties with God. Some are afraid of taking too much paines in theſe ſoule-workes with God, leſt they hurt their bodies, their fleſh. We can never lay out our ſtrength, or bring our fleſh to a better market, we can never put it off at a higher rate (if it muſt be put off) then in wayes of communion with God. Yet let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member we have a promiſe, that our bodyes ſhall thrive as well as our ſoules, even in thoſe duties of communion with God, which are moſt expenſive and ſevere to our fleſh, prayer with faſting. (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 58.61.) <hi>And the Lord ſhall guide thee continually, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thy ſoule in drought, and make fat thy bones.</hi> Which though
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:104248:188"/> it may have a more ſpirituall meaning, yet there is a truth in it as to the poynt in hand. Holy Faſting, which is a <hi>ſoule-fatning</hi> duty (as all agree) is under a gracious promiſe, that it ſhall alſo be a <hi>body-fatning,</hi> yea a <hi>bone-fatning</hi> duty. Now, though we have a good aſſurance, that while we are trading with God for the gaine and encreaſe of our ſoules, our bodyes ſhall not waſte nor be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, yet we ſhould be ready to waſte and weare off the fleſh from our bodyes for the gaine and encreaſe of our ſoules.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Why ſhould we be unwilling to offer our fleſh to be conſumed by the fury of men, or by the rage of flames in the cauſe of God, ſeeing it may ere long conſume by ſickneſs and not be ſeene? why ſhould we be afraid to let our fleſh conſume or rot in priſons, or by tortures for Chriſt, ſeeing a diſeaſe will doe it, and hath often done it? Thouſands of the blaſſed Martyrs, and ſuffering Saints, have rejoyced they had fleſh to conſume when God called them to it. So ſome interpret that Scripture before mentioned (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 12.14.) where the Apoſtle profeſſed, <hi>I am willing to be ſpent for you</hi> (how ſpent? as an offering or ſacrifice by fire) <hi>in the ſervice of your faith,</hi> and in bearing my witneſs to thoſe truths of the Goſpel which I have preached to you. And indeed, he in that ſenſe, ſpent his fleſh at the laſt, he ſuffered death, and let his fleſh fall, in holding up and holding out the faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. It is better that our fleſh ſhould be thus conſumed (if God call us to it) then that we leave it to be conſumed by age or ſickneſs, by wormes or rottenneſs. How freely ſhould we offer up this fleſh to ſo noble a conſumption, ſeeing we cannot keepe it long from ſo meane a conſumption, doe what we can?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>Sickneſs is a conſumer; ſickneſs is a conſumer of all that will conſume.</q>
                  <p>It conſumes the body, and it conſumes the purſe, yea it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes all our worldly comforts and concernments, it conſumes every thing but grace. We ſay, <hi>A time of ſickneſs is a ſpending time;</hi> the uſuall reference of that expreſſion, is to ſpiritualls. In health we gather grace and lay up truths, which we ſpend in ſickneſs. But though ſickneſs be a ſpending time, yet, it is not (I am ſure it ought not to be) a waſting time to grace and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualls.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:104248:188"/> A ſpending time it is, that is, a time wherein a godly man may lay out a great deale of his ſpirituall ſtock and heavenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, a great deale of faith and patience, a great deale of ſweet contentation and ſelfe-ſubmiſſion to God. But ſickneſs is not a waſting time to any of theſe graces or heavenly treaſures; yea where grace is reall and active, it is not only not waſted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, but encreaſed and improved, occaſionally, by ſickneſs; God having promiſed, <hi>that all things ſhall worke together for good to them that love him</hi> (Rom: 8.28.) will not ſuffer the beſt things of thoſe that love him (their graces) to take hurt by the worſt of bodyly ſickneſſes. Sickneſs doth only dammage the body, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the beauty of the fleſh; and it quickly doth, as <hi>Elihu</hi> affirme of his ſick man in the text, <hi>His fleſh is conſumed away, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeene,</hi> yea, as it followeth
<q>And his bones that were not ſeene, ſtick out.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fleſh and bones are the two eminent materialls of this faire and moſt regular building, The Body of man. The Bones of a healthy and ſtrong man, are not ſeene becauſe they are covered with fleſh; they are only felt or perceived through their cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, skin, and fleſh. God hath put theſe very comely and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full garments as a covering upon our bones: but ſickneſs pulls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way theſe coverings, it pulls away the cloaths from our bones, and makes them appeare, as it were, naked. When the fat is dript away, and the fleſh is ſpent, the bones ſeeme to ſtart out. We commonly ſay of a man that hath been conſumed by a lingring ſickneſs, <hi>He is a very Skelleton, he lookes like an Anatomy,</hi> which is nothing elſe but a pack of bones, the fleſh is gone. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> mourned (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 31.10.) <hi>My life is ſpent with griefe, my yeares with ſighing, my ſtrength faileth becauſe of mine iniquity: and my bones are conſumed.</hi> The ſin-ſickneſs of a ſencible ſoule conſumes the bones, more then any bodyly ſickneſs. This was not only the conſuming but the breaking of <hi>Davids</hi> bones (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 51.8.) And as his ſorrow for his owne tranſgreſſions, ſo his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the afflictions of <hi>Sion,</hi> had the like effect in him (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 102.3, 4, 5.) <hi>My dayes are conſumed like ſmoake or into ſmoake</hi> (they vaniſh like ſmoake) <hi>and my bones are burnt as a hearth. My heart is ſmitten, and withereth like graſſe; ſo that I forget to eate my bread; By reaſon of the voyce of my groaning, my bones cleave to my skin.</hi>

                  <p>It puts that out of ſight which was ſeen, and it brings that in ſight which was not ſeen; This holds true, not only as to that which is naturall in man, his fleſh and bones, of which this text treats in the letter; but 'tis true alſo as to that which is morall and ſpirituall in man, his virtues and his vices, his graces, and his luſts or corruptions. How often is the fleſh (in a morall ſence) that
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:104248:189"/> is, the outward profeſſion of a hypocrite conſumed in ſickneſs, and no more ſeen; <hi>will the hypocrite alwayes call upon God?</hi> (Job 27.10.) He will not. He that doth all to be ſeen (that's the character of a hypocrite (<hi>Math.</hi> 6.5.) will in a little time doe ſuch a little or rather ſuch a nothing in Religion, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeen at all. His profeſſion is ſick, when he is fick; and then alſo that which was not ſeen ſticks out; the hypocrite covereth many of his corruptions, his impatiency, murmuring, and unbelief, in a day of proſperity with the skin at left or fair ſhew of faith, but in a day of trouble thoſe dead bones appear, and ſtick out. A day of ſorrow, ſickneſſe, and trouble is a great diſcoverer; it occaſions the appearance and ſticking out of many baſe luſts that were not ſeen before. 'Tis ſo alſo in the better way with godly men, their corruptions, that appeared upon them before, are abated, waſted, and conſumed by affliction, and many of their graces which lay hid and unſeen, ſtick out and appear gloriouſly in a day of trouble, or upon a ſick bed. Their patience &amp; ſubmiſſion of ſpirit under the hand of God, their long-ſufferance and ſweet ſelf-reſignation to the will of God, which lay hid, ſhew themſelves. Sickneſſe and affliction make wonderfull changes and diſcoveries both as to the outward and inward man; <hi>'tis ſeldome ſeen or known either how good or how bad any man is, till he is in paine or reduced to ſome extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;</hi> till his very bones are vexed, or till, as <hi>Elihu</hi> further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the ſick man in the next verſe.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>Diſeaſes and death are near one another.</q>
                  <p>A ſick bed and a grave are not far diſtant; <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of himſelf and others in extreame danger of death by the cruell plots and cunning ſnares of the enemy, hath a like expreſſion (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.7.) <hi>Our bones are ſcattered at the graves mouth, as when one cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and cleaveth wood upon the earth;</hi> as if he had ſaid, we are ſo near death, that 'tis a miracle if we eſcape it. Though we are yet alive, yet we have the ſentence of death in our ſelves, and are within ſight of our graves. What <hi>David</hi> ſpake there of himſelf in conſort with others, <hi>Heman</hi> ſpake perſonally of himſelf (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.3.) <hi>My life draweth nigh unto the grave;</hi> We are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in our health drawing towards the grave, but in ſickneſs we are drawing near unto it. There is but a little diſtance between any man and the grave, there is ſcarcely any diſtance at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:104248:190"/> a man that is very ſick and the grave. Now if the ſick man be drawing near unto the grave, then</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Let them that are ſick remember the grave; 'tis our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be alwayes remembring and meditating upon the grave in our health, much more ſhould that be our remembrance &amp; medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, when we are ſick, moſt of all when we are ſick unto death, or ready to dye and drop into the grave.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; If the ſick are drawing neare unto the grave, then let ſick men draw near unto God; if ever you will draw near unto God, the living God, be ſure to doe it upon the borders of death; 'tis good yea beſt to draw nigh unto God when we are well, and all is well with us, even at beſt in the world (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25.) But when we are in danger or drawing nigh unto death, O how earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould we draw nigh unto God, in the actings of faith, and love, <hi>To whom ſhould we goe</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.68.) in the appearances and approaches of temporall death, but unto him who hath the words of eternall life. It is high time for us to draw nigh unto God, when any of the comforts of this life are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from us, is it not more then high time therefore, to draw nigh to him, when life it ſelfe is withdrawing from us, and we drawing nigh to the grave! <hi>How miſerable is their condition who have death near them, and God far from them. Though we walke through the valley of the ſhadow of death, yet</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> profeſſed he would not, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4.) we need not <hi>feare any evill, while God is with us;</hi> but how will the very ſhadowes of death put us in feare, if God be not with us? and what confidence can we have of his being with us, if we are not acquainted with him, if we uſe not to draw neare to him?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If they that are ſick draw near unto the grave, then it is good for ſuch as come to viſit their ſick friends, wiſely to mind them of the grave; when will a diſcourſe with our friends of death and the grave be ſeaſonable, if not when we ſee them dying and going to the grave? yet ſome, when they viſit ſick friends, will not ſpeak a word of either; they fear it may haſten death to hear of it, &amp; that ſpeaking of the grave may put them into it, then which I know no fear more fooliſh, or more to be feared. Yea ſome will forbid viſiters to mention death, when their Relations lye ſick, O doe not ſpeak of death to my Husband, ſaith the Wife, &amp;c. But remember it, if the ſick are drawing near to the grave,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:104248:191"/> they that viſit them ſhould remember them of the grave, both in prayer and in conference; to ſpeak of death cannot hurt the body, but the not ſpeaking of it may hurt the ſoul, and hinder it from getting out of the ſnares both of ſpirituall and eternall death. Yet godly prudence and great caution is to be uſed about it; none ſhould doe it bluntly, nor ſuddenly, but having by diſcreet inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, firſt hinted to the ſick man his danger of death, we ſhould then by faithfull counſells prepare him for it, and by comfortable Scripture cordialls ſtrengthen and arme his ſpirits againſt it. Such ſavoury and well mannaged diſcourſes of death may (through the bleſſing of God) be a ſavour of eternall life to the ſick man, and will not in the leaſt prejudice his recovery from ſickneſs, <hi>when his ſoul draweth near to the grave,</hi>

That Angells have ſuch a Miniſtry, is clear, (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.16.) Where (<hi>David</hi> having choſen to fall into the hands of God) an Angell is preſently diſpatcht to doe exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution upon his people. <hi>And when the Angell ſtretched out his hand upon Jeruſalem to deſtroy it, the Lord repented him of the evill, and ſaid to the Angell that deſtroyed the people, it is enough, stay now thine hand,</hi> &amp;c. That <hi>deſtroyer</hi> (ſo he is called, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.23.) who ſlew all the firſt borne of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> (Gods laſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt plague upon them, his tenth plague) is by moſt interpreted to be an Angell, yea by ſome a good Angell, becauſe appointed
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:104248:191"/> and directed by God to ſpare his people the Jewes, and to poure out his vengeance upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> his and their enemies. For moſt uſually the wicked are plagued by good Angells, and the good, as <hi>Job</hi> in this book was, are afflicted by evill Angells. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that text ſay ſome (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.49.) leadeth us rather to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that it was an evill Angell; <hi>He caſt upon them</hi> (meaning the <hi>Egyptians) the fierceneſſe of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, by ſending evill Angells among them.</hi> Yet poſſibly thoſe Angells which deſtroyed the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> are called evill Angells, not becauſe they were ſo in their nature, but becauſe they were Miniſters of evill to that hard-hearted people. Which way ſoever we take it, there is a truth in it applicable to the Scripture here in hand. And ſo ſome expound that of <hi>Solomon (Prov.</hi> 17.11.) <hi>An evill man ſeeketh only rebellion, therefore a cruell Meſſenger ſhall be ſent againſt him.</hi> The text may be rendred <hi>a cruell Angell,</hi> that is, an Angell with a Meſſage of wrath and deſtruction ſhall be ſent unto him; The Apoſtle (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10.) ſpeaking of thoſe dreadfull judgments, which God ſent upon his people the Jewes in the Wilderneſſe (ſuch as we are like to find in theſe Goſpell times, if we provoke him, for all thoſe things are ſaid <hi>to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto them for Types or examples (verſ.</hi> 11.) And there he gives us warning, <hi>neither murmure ye, as ſome of them alſo murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and were deſtroyed of the destroyer.</hi> That is, by the Peſtilence or Plague (as 'tis expreſſed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.12, 37.) which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> calleth a <hi>deſtroyer,</hi> becauſe, doubtleſs it was executed by ſome inviſible deſtroyer, or Angell. The Devill, whom <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelation (Chap.</hi> 9.11.) calleth, <hi>the Angell of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit,</hi> is there alſo ſet forth by this Title, <hi>whoſe name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.</hi> The Devill is the <hi>Apollyon,</hi> the <hi>Abaddon,</hi> both which ſignifie a deſtroyer; yea the Devill (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.) <hi>is ſaid to have the power of death,</hi> as if he were ſet over that ſad work, and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it over dying men; yet (let us know to our comfort) the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill hath not the power of death as a Lord, or Judge, but only as an Executioner; thus the ſick mans life may be ſaid to draw nigh to the deſtroyer, that is to the deſtroying Angell, or to the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we may take the <hi>deſtroyers,</hi> not for perſons ſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, but for diſeaſes, and ſickneſſes; theſe are deſtroyers. And
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:104248:192"/> thus it may be ſaid of a ſick man, <hi>his life draweth nigh to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers,</hi> that is, he is in the hand or under the power of ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, as probably will deſtroy him.

                     </gap>cept that renowned two, <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua;</hi> And therefore he having ſeene the great deſtruction of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:104248:193"/> for their murmurings and unbeliefe, for their ten-fold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations in the wilderneſs, might ſay from his owne experience more then moſt men to that poynt of mans mortality. And as God turned that people to deſtruction, and ſayd according to that irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable ſentence (<hi>Gen:</hi> 3.19.) <hi>Returne ye children of men</hi> to your originall and firſt materiall, <hi>dust;</hi> ſo he ſaith the ſame to men every day, who as they are duſt, ſo we ſee them returning to their duſt. Every diſeaſe, if ſo commiſſion'd by God, is death, and every paine (if he ſay it) the period of our lives.</p>
                  <p>Againe, <hi>Elihu</hi> is here ſpeaking of a man whom the Lord is but trying, teaching, and inſtructing upon his ſick bed; yet he ſaith, <hi>His ſoule is drawing neere to the grave, and his life to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Thoſe afflictions which are but for inſtruction, may looke like thoſe which are for deſtruction.</q>
                  <p>When the Lord hath a purpoſe only to try a man, he often acts towards him as if he would kill him. If any ſhall ſay, this is hard, I anſwer; <hi>A ruffe horſe muſt have a ruffe rider.</hi> Ruffe wood will not cleave without a beetle and wedges. We put God to uſe extremities, that he may bring us to a moderation. Our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are often ſo ruffe and head-ſtrong, that they muſt be kept in with bit and bridle; they are ſo tough and knotty that there's no working, no cleaving of them till the Lord ſets his wedges to us, and layes on with his beetle of heavieſt and hardeſt afflictions; In a word, we even compell him to bring us to deaths-doore, that he may teach us to live.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing paines and ſickneſſes (of which <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeakes as the way and meanes by which God ſpeakes to ſinfull man) are accompanied with ſuch dreadfull ſymptomes and effects, loathing and loſſe of appetite, conſumption of the fleſh, and the breaking of the very bones, the ſoule drawing neere to the grave, and life to the deſtroyers; ſeeing I ſay, there are ſuch ſad effects of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, remember,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Health is worth the praying to God for.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Health is worth the praiſing of God for;</hi> and that conſidered, either, firſt, as continued, or, ſecondly, as reſtored. 'Tis a mercy not to be pained, not to be ſicke; 'tis a more ſenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:104248:193"/> though not a greater mercy to be freed from paine, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered out of ſickneſs. While we are kept free from paines and ſickneſſes, how thankfull ſhould we be; and when we are freed from and brought out of the bonds of bodily paine and ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, how ſoule-ſicke, yea how dead are we if we are not thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full!</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Seeing paines and ſickneſſes are ſuch ſad afflictions; be wiſe and carefull for the preſervation of your health; doe not throw away your health upon a luſt, doe not expoſe your ſelves to laſting paines and pining ſickneſſes, for the ſatisfying of a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſenſuall appetite. The health and ſtrength of this frayle bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, are of more value then ten thouſand of thoſe vaniſhing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. Yet how many are there, who run themſelves to the graves mouth, and into the thickeſt throngs of thoſe deſtroyers, for the taking up of ſuch pitifull and periſhing delights? who to pleaſe their fleſh for a few moments in ſurfeiting, drunkenneſs, and wantonneſs, bring many dayes, yea moneths and yeares of paine and torment upon their fleſh? yea, and not only ſhorten (I meane as to what they might probably have had by the courſe of nature) the number of their dayes, but ſuddenly end &amp; extinguiſh them. It hath been ſayd of old, <hi>Gluttony kills more men then the ſword;</hi> that is, it caſts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>em into killing diſeaſes. 'Tis a <hi>maxime</hi> in warre; <hi>Starve your enemy if you can rather then fight him; cut his throat without a knife, deſtroy him without drawing a ſword;</hi> that is, with <hi>hunger.</hi> Some are indeed deſtroyed with hunger, and hunger, if not relieved, will deſtroy any man! Yet ſurfeiting deſtroyeth more then hunger, and 'tis a more quicke and ſpeedy deſtroyer. We have knowne many who have cut their owne throats, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting too much and too faſt for their bellyes; Pampering the Body deſtroyeth more bodies then ſtarving. Many while they draw nigh to their Tables, their ſoules (as <hi>Elihu</hi> here ſaith) <hi>are drawing neere to the grave, and their life to the deſtroyers.</hi> Therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and conſider, O ye that are men given to appetite, (as <hi>Solomon</hi> calleth ſuch, <hi>Pro:</hi> 23:2.) or rather as the Hebrew ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy there hath it, <hi>ye that are Maſters of appetite,</hi> ſtudying your Bellyes, till indeed ye are maſtered by appetite, to you, I ſay, remember and conſider, <hi>Health is more then meate, and life then dainty faire.</hi> All the content that intemperance can give you, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not recompence you for the paines that ſickneſs will give you;
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:104248:194"/> you may have pleaſure for an houre or two, and ſickneſs for a moneth or two, for a yeare or two. And if all the pleaſure we take in ſatisfying that which though it may be glutted, yet will not be ſatisfied, a luſt, cannot recompence the paines that are found in a ſick bed for a few dayes, moneths or yeares, how will it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence any for thoſe everlaſting paines that are found in hell, where the damned ſhall be alwayes converſing with death and deſtruction, and yet never dye nor be deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Foraſmuch as ſickneſs is often accompanied with ſuch grievous dolours and racking tortures, let the ſick pray much that they may be armed with patience; who knows what tryalls and extremities ſickneſs may bring him to? Though the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and firſt appearances of it are but ſmall, like the cloud which firſt appeared to the ſervant of <hi>Eliah,</hi> onely of a hands-breadth, yea though it begin but with the little finger of the hand, yet as that little cloud did the whole face of the heaven, ſo this little diſtemper may over-ſpread the whole body, and put you to the exerciſe of all your patience: it may hang and encreaſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, till it hath broken your bones, and conſumed your fleſh, and brought you to the graves mouth, therefore pray for pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Let not the ſtrong man glory in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ngth, nor the healthy man in his health; ſickneſſe may come ſhortly, and then how ſtrong ſoever any man is, downe he muſt, and lye by it. There's no wreſtling away ſickneſs any way (if God ſend it and bid it come) but by wreſtling with God (as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, <hi>Gen:</hi> 32.) in prayer. If you thinke to wreſtle away bodily ſickneſs by bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrength and ſtriving with it, you will be throwne and get the fall. Who can ſtand before a feaver, or a conſumption, when they arreſt us in the name of the Great King, and carry us priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to our beds? Therefore let no man glory in his ſtrength, if any man doe, it ſhewes at preſent his morall weakneſs; and his naturall weakneſs may quickly teach him another leſſon, and ſpoyle his glorying.</p>

               <p>THeſe words hold forth the third way by which God ſpeakes or reveales himſelfe to man, and recovers him out of his ſin. As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid; <hi>When God hath brought a man to his ſick bed, and he yet continueth in his blindneſs, not perceiving either his owne errour, or the purpoſe and intention of God to him; If then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this God ſo order the matter, that in his mercifull provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he provideth for his further inſtruction, and ſends a ſpeciall meſſenger (as he doth me to thee) an interpreter (which is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular favour of God) to explain, and expound the meaning of his dealings with him, and what his owne condition is, to bring him to a true ſight and ſence of his ſin, and to ſet him upright in the ſight of God, by the actings of faith and repentance; this ſoone altereth the caſe, and hereupon God is preſently appeaſed towards him. Then he is gracious, and then many bleſſed fruits and effects of his grace doe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and are heaped on him.</hi> Here, therefore, we have a very illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious inſtance of Gods loving kindneſs to poore ſinfull man, recovering and fetching him backe (when he is as it were halfe dead) from the gates of death, reſtoring him both as to ſoule and body, putting him into a perfect (ſo farre as on this ſide hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it may be called perfect) ſtate, and giving him indeed what he can reaſonably deſire of him. In the context of theſe foure verſes; Conſider</p>

               <p>Firſt, The inſtrument, or meanes by which God brings this about, and that is, by ſending a meſſenger, or a choice interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the ſick mans bed, to counſel and adviſe him. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 23. <hi>If there be a meſſenger with him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We have here the motive, or firſt moving cauſe of this mercy, that is, the grace or free favour of God, <hi>then he will be gracious unto him;</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Deliver him from going downe to the pit,</hi> that is, being gracious he will give forth this word for his deliverance. <hi>Then he is gracious to him,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Thirdly, We have here the meritorious Cauſe of this merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deliverance; and that is a ranſom; <hi>I have found a ranſom,</hi> at the latter end of the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We have the ſpeciall benefits of this deliverance, which are two-fold.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>What or who is this meſſenger? The word in the Hebrew hath a three-fold ſignification; all which are inſiſted upon by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters upon this place.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It ſignifieth <hi>an Angel;</hi> Now, Angels properly taken are ſpirituall or incorporeall ſubſtances, whoſe both office and high dignity it is to attend about the throne of God, and to be ſent forth upon his ſpeciall ſervice (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 103.20.) <hi>Bleſs the Lord ye his Angels that excell in ſtrength, that doe his commandements,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:104248:195"/> and hearken to the voyce of his word.</hi> God <hi>hath thouſand thouſands of theſe ſervants miniſtring to him, and ten thouſand times ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſtanding before him</hi> (Dan: 7.10.)</p>
                  <p>Some ſtay upon this expoſition, affirming that here we are to underſtand an Angel by nature; And hereupon ground the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring of Angels to thoſe who are either ſick in body, or troubled in mind. Yea the Popiſh writers would hence prove the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Angels for man, and mans invocation of Angels; but though the expoſition be granted, yet it yeilds no ground for this Inference. For what though God ſhould ſend an Angel to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and comfort a ſick man, will it therefore follow that the ſick man ſhould pray to him, and ſo give him the honour which is due to God?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The word is applyed in particular to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the uncreated Angel, or the creating Angel, the Lord of Angels,</hi> who, by way of eminency is called, <hi>The Angel of his preſence, (Iſa:</hi> 63.9.) <hi>and the (Angel or) meſſenger of the Covenant, (Mal:</hi> 3.1.) He alſo was that Angel of whom the Lord ſpake to the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (Exod: 23.20.) ſaying,<note place="margin">Vides quam cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rè hoc loco Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu de Chriſto concionetur; per quem omnis conſcientia, quontumcun<expan>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Behold I ſend an Angel before thee, to keepe thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. Beware of him, and obey his voyce, provoke him not, for he will not pardon your tranſgreſſions</hi> (if you perſiſt in them) <hi>for my name is in him,</hi> that is, he is of the ſame nature with my ſelfe, and with that nature he hath my name, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah.</hi> Thus ſome carry it here, as if <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpecially intended the miniſtration of Jeſus Chriſt, the Angel of the Covenant, to the ſick ſinner, for his reſtoring both as to the health of ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. 'Tis true, Jeſus Chriſt is the great Angel, or meſſenger, and he primarily and chiefly doth all the buſineſs for poore ſinners; he is the meſſenger ſent from God, and he is the interpreter of the mind of God, he came from the boſom of the father, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales the myſteries of heaven to us by his holy Spirit. He indeed is <hi>the one of a thouſand,</hi> the chiefeſt of ten thouſand, to ſhew unto man his uprightneſs. Yet, I conceive, that in this place, not the Lord of Angels alone, but ſome Angel of the Lord is alſo intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And therefore,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The word <hi>Angel</hi> is applyable to every Meſſenger; The Scripture gives it firſt to thoſe that are ſent by men about any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand or buſineſs (1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 23.27.) <hi>But there came a meſſenger
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:104248:196"/> unto Saul, ſaying, haſt thee and come; for the Philiſtims have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the land.</hi> We read of an evill meſſenger (<hi>Pro:</hi> 13.17.) who is either ſuch a one as brings an evill meſſage, or is himſelfe evill (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 14.32.) <hi>What ſhall one then anſwer to the meſſengers of the Nation, the Lord hath founded Zion, and the poore of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall truſt in it.</hi> And as it notes a meſſenger firſt by man, ſo a meſſenger ſent by God. The ancient Prophets were in this ſence the Angells of God, his meſſengers, and ſo are the Miniſters of the Goſpel at this day. The Epiſtles to the ſeaven Churches, are all directed to <hi>the Angells of the Churches,</hi> that is, to the ſeverall Paſtors or Miniſters of the Churches reſpectively. And thus we may conclude, that by the meſſenger in this text, we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand any faithfull Miniſter of Chriſt, ſent to convince, convert, or comfort a ſick troubled ſoule. And, as was intimated before, we may very well gather up both theſe latter interpretations into one, that which applyeth it to Chriſt, and that which applyeth it to the Miniſters of Chriſt. For ſo we have here both the author and the inſtrument of this comfort to the ſick man. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the chiefe meſſenger and comforter of poore ſinners;</hi> and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel are inſtruments in his hand, ſent out by him for the perfecting of that worke. The word is applyed to both, (<hi>Mal:</hi> 3.1.<note place="margin">Nuncius eſt propheta ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis ſeu doctor à deo miſſus. <hi>Piſc:</hi>
                     </note>) <hi>Behold, I will ſend my meſſenger</hi> (or, <hi>my Angel) and he ſhall prepare the way before me. John</hi> the Baptiſt was Chriſts meſſenger, as Chriſt himſelfe (an infallible interpreter) aſſureth us (<hi>Math:</hi> 11.10.) And preſently it follows, <hi>The Lord whom ye ſeek ſhall ſuddenly come to his Temple, even the meſſenger of the Covenant, whom ye delight in; Behold, he ſhall come, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> In the firſt part of the verſe, <hi>John</hi> is called the <hi>Lords meſſenger,</hi> and in the latter part <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called <hi>the Lords meſſenger.</hi> Both were meſſengers, yet with a mighty difference; and therefore <hi>John</hi> the meſſenger of Chriſt, ſaith of Chriſt the meſſenger, (<hi>Math:</hi> 3.11.) <hi>He that cometh after me is mightier then I, whoſe ſhoes I am not worthy to beare.</hi> And againe (<hi>John</hi> 1.26.) <hi>He it is that coming after me is preferred before me, whoſe ſhoes latchet I am not worthy to unlooſe. If there be a meſſenger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Miniſters of Chriſt are the meſſengers of Chriſt.</q>
                  <p>Chriſt is the fathers meſſenger, and they are meſſengers ſent
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:104248:196"/> out by Chriſt. <hi>As my father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> (John 20.21.) And though that Title of <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>One ſent,</hi> or a <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> be moſt properly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to thoſe, who were immediately called and inſpired by Chriſt, yet in an allayed ſence it may be applyed, commodiouſly enough, to any true Miniſter of the Goſpel, for he alſo is ſent; he hath both his miſſion and commiſſion mediately from Chriſt. Yea the word <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is applyed in common to all or any that are ſent upon buſineſs (<hi>John</hi> 13.16.<note place="margin">Apoſtolus hic non ſpecialis muneris, ſed generale no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men eſt, miſſum cum mandatis ſignificans. <hi>Grot:</hi>
                     </note>) <hi>He that is ſent</hi> (let him be who he will or upon what occaſion ſoever he is ſent) <hi>is not greater then he that ſends him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then, the Miniſters of the Goſpel are called the <hi>meſſengers</hi> of Chriſt; Firſt, Becauſe they are ſent by Chriſt; and have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from him. Secondly, They are his <hi>meſſengers</hi> becauſe they are inſtructed by Chriſt, and carry forth his mind: they may not ſpeake their owne words, nor their owne ſence, but the word which they bring, is or ought to be, what they have received, or what Chriſt hath put into their mouthes, that's their duty. And the meſſengers of Chriſt are to ſpeak his mind.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Plainly (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2.4.) <hi>In the demonſtration of the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, boldly, not flattering the perſons, nor fearing the faces of men. Thirdly, They ſhould ſpeak <hi>authoritatively,</hi> though they beſeech, and beg, and pray, yet they are to doe all as having a warrant for what they doe, and as being cloathed with power from on high. <hi>If any man ſpeak</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11.) <hi>let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God.</hi> As he is to ſpeak <hi>the Oracles of God,</hi> ſo as the oracles of God. Some ſpeak, who doe not ſpeak the oracles of God, but their owne opinions. Others ſpeak the oracles of God materially, that is, they deliver divine truths, yet they doe not ſpeak them <hi>as the oracles of God,</hi> with that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which becomes the Goſpel; we ſay of ſome, <hi>They marr their tale in the telling;</hi> Though they report, or tell the mind of him that ſent them, yet they ſpoyle it in reporting it; The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel ſpoyle their meſſage, unleſſe they report it plainly, boldly, and with Authority.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If Miniſters be the meſſengers of Chriſt, ſurely then, they are to be heard, and their meſſage is to be received; if God ſends a meſſenger to us, ſhall we not open the doore to him? if a friend ſend a meſſenger to us, he takes it very ill (and well
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:104248:197"/> he may) if we doe not. 'Tis below civility, 'tis an high affront to a man not to receive his meſſage, what is it then to the moſt high God! How dreadfull is that woe which Chriſt pronounceth againſt ſuch as refuſe either his meſſengers, or their meſſage, (<hi>Math:</hi> 10.14, 15.) <hi>Whoſoever ſhall not receive you, nor heare your words; When ye depart out of that houſe or City, ſhake off the dust of your feete;</hi> Implying, that God would ſo ſhake them off, or eſteeme them no more then the vileſt duſt. Yea (as another Goſpel hath it (<hi>Mark</hi> 6.11.) implying, that as they had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the teſtimony which his meſſengers bare of him, ſo their duſt ſhould be kept <hi>as a teſtimony againſt them.</hi> And leſt the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe threatned them in this aenigmatical or covert ſpeech ſhould not be underſtood, Chriſt himſelfe expounds it in the next words, <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, it ſhall be more tolerable for the land of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Gomorrha in the day of Judgement, then for that City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, 'Tis not enough barely to receive Chriſts Meſſengers, they muſt be received as the Meſſengers of Chriſt. Such a recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Apoſtle found among the <hi>Galatians, (Chap.</hi> 4.14.) <hi>And my temptation (or daily affliction) which was in my fleſh, ye deſpiſed not, nor rejected, but received me as an Angell of God, even as Christ Jeſus.</hi> And what is ſaid of the Meſſenger, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood alſo of his meſſage, both are to be received as from Chriſt. How is that, you will ſay? Take it in theſe four words, Firſt, when 'tis received <hi>gladly, (Acts</hi> 2.4.) It ſhould be the joy of our hearts (the Pſalmiſt calls it the <hi>joyfull ſound,</hi> Pſ. 89.15.) to hear a word from Chriſt. Secondly, when it is received <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,</hi> and reſpectfully, as giving honour to the meſſage and the Meſſenger for Chriſts ſake. Thirdly, when 'tis received obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entially, as ſubmitting to the word; elſe your reſpectfull, and joyfull receiving the meſſage of Chriſt is but a complement, or piece of Courtſhip. Fourthly, when their <hi>whole meſſage</hi> is thus received, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſaid to <hi>Peter (Acts</hi> 10.33.) <hi>We are all here preſent before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</hi> We muſt receive not only thoſe things that ſute us well, but thoſe things that are moſt croſſe to our corrupt natures and intereſts, whether of worldly profit or pleaſure; this is to receive the Meſſengers and meſſages of Jeſus Chriſt, as his. <hi>If there be a Meſſenger,</hi>

Some conceive the Latine word <hi>(Mel)</hi> for honey hath its originall from it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the meſſage, or interpretation that comes from God ſhould be ſweet, as honey to us; <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth, <hi>The word of God is ſweeter then honey, and the hony-comb,</hi> (Pſal. 19.10.) As if he had ſaid, 'tis ſweeter to the ſoul then that which is ſweeteſt to ſenſe. Now, the <hi>meſſenger</hi> ſent from God, is called an <hi>interpreter,</hi> becauſe he is ſent to interpret and declare the mind of God to his people. Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> renders, <hi>A Teacher.</hi> The word <hi>interpreter</hi> may be taken three wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For any one that interpreteth tongues or languages. Thus 'tis ſaid (<hi>Gen.</hi> 42.23.) <hi>Joſeph ſpake to his brethren by an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> they ('tis like) did not underſtand the Egyptian language, and he either for ſtate, or to conceale himſelf the better, would not ſeem to underſtand theirs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is an interpreter of miſteries as well as of languages. Many things ſpoken in our own language may need an interpreter more then the words of a ſtrange language. We read (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.6.) <hi>of a Parable, and the interpretation of it.</hi> Parables are wiſe, but hard and dark ſayings, they need an interpreter.

                  <p>Further, We may diſtinguiſh of a threefold interpreter. Firſt, a grammaticall interpreter, whoſe buſineſs is to give the ſence of words. Secondly, a logicall interpreter, who gathers up the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſcope and mind of any ſentence, or the purpoſe of man in what he ſpeaketh. Thirdly, there is the divine of ſpirituall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:104248:198"/> who labours to bring the truths of God, and the heart of man together. The Apoſtle having treated about prophecying, concludes (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.25.) <hi>And thus are the ſecrets of his heart made manifeſt, and ſo falling down on his face he will worſhip God, and report that God is in you of a truth;</hi> as if the man that beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, or one unlearned (for of ſuch he ſpeaks, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24.) had ſaid, ſurely <hi>theſe men underſtand what is in my heart, for they have brought the truth of God, and my heart together, ſo that I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe God is in them,</hi> that is, <hi>there is a divine wiſdome or interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them.</hi> When <hi>Elihu</hi> faith, <hi>If there be an interpreter,</hi> we are to underſtand him in this laſt ſence; not of one that can inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret words, like a Grammarian, or give the ſcope and ſence of words like a Logician, but of one that hath a divine skill to bring the truths of God home to the heart of man, that is, to convince &amp; informe an ignorant conſcience, and to comfort, relieve and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a troubled conſcience. <hi>If there be an interpreter,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>The Miniſters of Chriſt are the interpreters of the mind and good will of God toward poor ſinners.</q>
                  <p>They interpret the mind of God as to peace and reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to grace and ſalvation, as well as to duty and holineſs of converſation. 'Tis the niceſt and hardeſt thing in the world to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the mind of God aright to a ſinner, to bring his heart to a cloſing with the great truths, and promiſes of the Goſpel; he that can doe this skilfully is worthy the name of an interpreter. The Apoſtle ſaith of him who is but a babe in Chriſt and uſeth milke (that is, lives upon the lower and more eaſie principles of faith) <hi>he is unskillfull in the word of righteouſneſſe</hi> (Heb. 5.13.) that is, he knowes not how to make out and mannage for his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the doctrine of free grace through the alone righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt. And therefore, as firſt, God himſelf is the author and fountaine of this grace; as ſecondly, Jeſus Chriſt is the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer or procurer of the fruits of this grace to ſinners; as thirdly, the effectuall worker of our hearts to receive this grace, as alſo the witneſs-bearer and ſealer of it to our ſouls is the holy Spirit; as fourthly, the word of the Goſpell is the Charter, and Covenant of this grace: ſo fifthly, the Miniſters of Chriſt are the interpreters of this grace; and they are, or ought to be skillfull in this word of
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:104248:198"/> righteouſneſs. Their skill and duty is firſt to explaine what the Covenant is, and rightly to lay down how the ſinners reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God is wrought. Secondly, to make a ſutable and ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble application of it, or to bring it home to the ſouls and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of poor ſinners, as they find their ſtate to be. And as the Miniſters of Chriſt are Gods interpreters to his people, ſo they are the peoples interpreters unto God. They are the former, two wayes; Firſt, by opening the mind of God to his people; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by urging and preſſing them to receive it both for their direction and conſolation. They are the latter four wayes: Firſt, by laying open and ſpreading the peoples wants, and weakneſſes before God. Secondly, by confeſſing their ſins, and tranſgreſſions to God. Thirdly, by intreating the Lord for them, or by praying for mercy, pardon, and forgiveneſs in their behalfe, for ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Fourthly, by giving thanks in their name for mercies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Thus they are firſt, Gods mouth to the people in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; declaring the Goſpel; Secondly, the peoples mouth to God in prayer and thanksgiving. And in both performe the worke and Office of an interpreter.</p>
                  <p>And if the Miniſters of the Goſpell are interpreters; Then,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Every Miniſter muſt be acquainted with the mind of God. He muſt have skill in the myſtery of the Goſpel. How ſhall he be able to interpret the mind of God to ſinners, who is not acquainted with the mind of God? <hi>We have the mind of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle of himſelfe and his fellow-labourers in the Goſpel (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16.) and when he ſaith, we have the mind of Chriſt, his meaning is not only this, that they had the mind of Chriſt written in a book, but they had a cleare under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it, and ſo were fitted to interpret it to others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As he muſt have the knowledge of the myſtery, ſo he muſt have the tongue of the learned (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.4.) <hi>That he may be able to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary;</hi> that is, to the wounded, and troubled in conſcience; This is the interpreter intended by <hi>Elihu.</hi> He is one that hath learned, and is taught of God. Humane learning, the knowledge of Arts, and Sciences, is good, and hath its uſe; but divine learning, or learning in divine things, that is to be divinely learned, ('tis poſſible for one to have learning in divine things, and not to be divinely learned) is abſolutely neceſſary to make him an interpreter. It is not
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:104248:199"/> enough to know divine things, but he muſt know them divinely, or by the unction and teachings of the Spirit. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> (Rev: 10.8.) <hi>is commanded to eat the book;</hi> this eating of the book, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſpirituall knowledg of divine truths; in this ſence, we know no more then we eat, then we (as it were) turn into our own ſubſtance, that which is eaten becomes one with us; the myſtery of the Goſpell muſt be eaten by the interpreter of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell myſteries. A man cannot interpret the mind of God till he knows it; and he cannot know the mind of God, unleſſe God himſelf reveals it; ſo the Apoſtle argueth (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. from 12, to 16.) <hi>As no man knoweth the mind of a man, but the ſpirit of a man that is in him, ſo the things of the ſpirit of God knoweth no man, but the ſpirit of God, and he to whom the Spirit of God doth reveale them.</hi> And therefore though a man may have an abillity to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the word of God, as 'tis an excellent book, a book full of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable knowledge, he may (I ſay) have an abillity to interpret it ſoundly by humane learning, yet no man can doe it ſavingly and convertingly, but by the help of the Spirit. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.14.) <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant;</hi> he will ſhew it effectually, he will make them know it. Thus <hi>David</hi> prayed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.18.) <hi>Lord open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wonderous things out of thy Law.</hi> Naturall parts and humane learning, arts and languages may give us an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the tenour and literal meaning of the Law of God; but none of theſe can open our eyes to behold the wonders of the Law, much leſſe the wonders and myſteries of the Goſpell. The opening of our eyes to behold theſe ſpirituall wonders is the Lords work, and it ſhould be marvelous in our eyes. For this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the eye (and nothing without this) will make any man the moſt ignorant man among a thouſand, <hi>An Interpreter</hi>
                     <q>One among a thouſand.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words containe either a third higher Title, or the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt commendation of the former two. A <hi>meſſenger,</hi> an <hi>interpreter,</hi> even ſuch a one as is <hi>one among a thouſand; One</hi> is no number, and a <hi>thouſand</hi> is put for the greateſt number; then <hi>one among a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,</hi> or <hi>one of a thouſand,</hi> implyeth that the one here ſpoken of is a very rare one; only he that is ſeldome ſeen, or found, is <hi>one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a thouſand; Solomon</hi> ſaith (<hi>Eccl:</hi> 7.24.) <hi>One man among
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:104248:199"/> a thouſand have I found, but a woman among all thoſe have I not found.</hi> There were very few wiſe or good men among many when he found but one among a thouſand. He might find men in great number, but the number of thoſe that deſerved to be called <hi>men</hi> was very ſmall, ſo ſmall, that he ſaith he found but <hi>one</hi> among a thouſand. So that here when <hi>Elihu</hi> calls the <hi>interpreter One among a thouſand,</hi> he teacheth us that ſuch a meſſenger, ſuch an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is rarely to be had, or being had is a very rare and excellent one. 'Tis a proverbiall ſpeech, with an hyperbole,<note place="margin">Hi nuncii rari ſunt ita ut ex mille homini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, vix unus reperiatur, qui munere illo rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tè fungi poſſit. <hi>Piſc:</hi>
                     </note> to ſay of any man, he is <hi>one among a thouſand;</hi> for though we are not to take it arithmetically or ſtrictly, yet <hi>one</hi> being no number, muſt needs ſignifie very few, or the ſmalleſt number, and a <hi>thouſand</hi> being the greateſt whole number muſt needs ſignifie many, very many or a great number. And therefore to ſay of this <hi>interpreter, he is one among a thouſand,</hi> muſt needs import, that even among a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, we can hardly find one who hath a faculty or a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency for this office, or is fit to be honoured and adorned with this Title, <hi>An interpreter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>True and faithfull interpreters of the mind of God are very rare.</q>
                  <p>He is a rare and choyce man that is pickt out of a thouſand men. The faithfull meſſengers and interpreters of the mind of Chriſt, are rare under a twofold notion; Firſt, as being precious and of great worth and uſe. Such are the light of the world, and the ſalt of the earth; The minds of all men would be darke, and their manners corrupt, if God did not ſend out theſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to inlighten and to ſeaſon them. Secondly, they are rare as not being every where to be had or met with; what is hardly had is highly prized. It is ſaid (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.1.) <hi>The word of God was precious in thoſe dayes,</hi> why ſo? the reaſon is added, <hi>there was no open viſion,</hi> there were not ſuch frequent manifeſtations of the mind of God, as had been formerly; there were few Prophets few Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters to be found in thoſe dayes. The true and faithfull meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers or interpreters of the mind of God, are rare at all times, in what numbers ſoever they appear, though they come like an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by thouſands, though (as is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.11.) <hi>God giving the word great be the company</hi> (we put in the Margin <hi>Army) of
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:104248:200"/> thoſe that publiſh it,</hi> or (as the old tranſlation hath it) <hi>great be the Company of the Preachers.</hi> They are rare, alſo, becauſe not to be had at ſome times and in many places. Look over the times or ages of the world, and you will find ſome of them were dark times, dayes of ignorance, there were few interpreters; look at any time or at this time over many parts and places of the world, and you ſhall find ſuch interpreters are not to be found in the greateſt part, in the moſt places of it. Not one to be had in ſome whole countries and huge tracts of the earth. Goe to all the Heathen and Mahometan nations, and you ſhall not find one of theſe meſſengers, or interpreters; goe to <hi>Greece,</hi> which anciently engroſſed all knowledge, and was famous for all ſorts of learning, yet an interpreter is ſcarcely to be found there in theſe dayes. Goe to the popiſh nations, though they bear the name of Chriſt, and abound with learned men, men learned in the knowledg not only of common Arts and Sciences, but in divinity and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; yet in the ſence here ſpoken of they have not many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, the moſt being ſuch as pervert and wreſt the Scriptures, and lead the people into errour, rather the meſſengers of Antichriſt, then of Chriſt; Satans emiſſaries, then Gods interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. So then, if we conſider, that ſeveral parts and countries of the world are quite without, they have none, and others are filled with falſe teachers &amp; interpreters of the word of God, which are worſe then none, we muſt conclude an interpreter <hi>is one of a thouſand,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, If we turne our eyes to thoſe parts of the world, where there are many ſound, orthodox, faithfull meſſengers and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the word of God (with which bleſſing this nation (above many, if I ſay not above all) hath been crowned for a hundred years together; <hi>England</hi> as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of old (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 21.1.) may well be called <hi>a valley of viſion, a ſeminary of ſeers,</hi> becauſe of that abundance and variety of viſions and divine revelations which God hath ſtored us with in theſe latter ages) yet (I ſay) even here as in all other the beſt reformed Proteſtant Churches and chriſtian nations, an <hi>interpreter</hi> may be called <hi>one of a thouſand;</hi> and that in a twofold reference.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If we conſider, the whole body of any reformed nation, Miniſters are but few compared to all the people, they are hardly ſo much as one of a thouſand, throughout that whole nation; there are but few who give themſelves up to the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:104248:200"/> Few that dedicate themſelves to Chriſts ſervice in publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, for the ſaving of ſouls; there is (I ſay) but one of a thouſand that is dedicated to that work.</p>
                  <p>For Firſt, Moſt are unwilling to meddle wſth that calling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the laboriouſneſs of it; interpreters are they who labour in the word and doctrine, and not only ſo, but they muſt give a ſtrict account to Chriſt of their labours. Some good men have declined the miniſtery, being terrified both with the weight of the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k, and the ſtrictneſs of the account, and doubtleſs (were we duely ſenſible) it might make the ableſt Miniſters tremble every hour of the day, to think what a burden of care and account lyeth upon them, who are ſet to watch over ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others will not enter into this calling, becauſe as the labour is great, and the account ſtrict, ſo the reward, as from man, is ſmall; it doth not lead to riches, and greatneſs in the World, comparatively with other callings; though there be a comfortable competence allowed to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, yet there is not much of the world to be expected by them, yea they are charged not to look for much, or not to doe their worke <hi>for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind</hi> (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As the reward is ſmall, ſo the oppoſition is great, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are often perſecuted, and reproacht, and the more faithfull and dilligent they are, the more they are oppoſed and reproached. To preach the Goſpel fully as it ſhould be preacht, is to provoke thouſands, and bring the World about our eares. No marvell then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> rhe meſſengers and interpreters of it be not many, if they be but as one among a thouſand. Thus you ſee what hinders the generallity of men from medling with that work. 'Tis but one among a thouſand that will engage in a work upon theſe hard termes, or that prae-apprehending them, hath faith and ſelf-denyal enough to ſwallow and overcome them.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Conſider thoſe that outwardly bear the name and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and you will find that among them, they who are true and faithfull to their truſt, are upon the matter, but one among a thouſand. As there are but few Miniſters among many men, ſo there are but few Miniſters among many that are true and right interpreters. Doe but take out or ſever theſe five ſorts from among them who pretend to be Miniſters, and then it will ſoone appear that the interpreters in truth are but few among many of thoſe that are ſo in Title.</p>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:104248:201"/>
                  <p>Firſt, Take away all thoſe, who thruſt themſelves boldly, or are admitted careleſly, or by miſtake into the Miniſtery, who yet are ignorant, blind, ungifted, and ſo unable for the worke.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take away thoſe, who though they have gifts and abilities, yet are lazie, and ſloathfull, ſuch as will not take paines nor worke in the worke.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Take away thoſe, who have gifts, and are induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet are unſound (at leaſt in many poynts) and erronious in their judgements, and ſo miſ-lead and miſ-guide thoſe, whoſe guides and leaders they are.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Take away thoſe, who though they are not unſound, and erronious, yet are prophane, and ſcandalous, pulling downe that truth with one hand which they have ſet up with another, or building againe thoſe ſins by their practiſe, which they have deſtroyed by preaching, and ſo make themſelves (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes in a like caſe, <hi>Gal:</hi> 2.18.) <hi>tranſgreſſours;</hi> for as God juſtly calls ſuch <hi>tranſgreſſours,</hi> becauſe they have ſinned againſt his word, ſo they make themſelves tranſgreſſours, becauſe they ſin againſt their owne; even againſt the doctrine by which they have condemned thoſe ſins, which themſelves live in.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Take away thoſe, who though they are neither of theſe, neither ignorant, nor idle, nor unſound, nor ſcandalous, yet are but meere formall preachers, ſuch as only ſpeake words, deliver the out-ſide, and skin of the Goſpel, but have no acquaintance with the marrow and power of it. Take away theſe five ſorts from among Miniſters, and ſurely this expreſſion of <hi>Elihu</hi> will be but too much verified, <hi>The interpreter is but one among a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</hi> Abſtract all that are ignorant, idle, unſound, ſcandalous, formall diſpencers of the word, from thoſe who are commonly called Miniſters, and then, they who remaine will be very few, ſo few, that every one of them, may be reckoned, <hi>one among a thouſand.</hi> And we ſhall be forced to ſay, that <hi>Elihu</hi> hath not ſayd without cauſe, whether we reſpect their excellency or their ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, that any faithfull meſſenger or interpreter <hi>is one among a thouſand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is not ſpoken by <hi>Elihu</hi> here, nor ought it to be taken up by any of the moſt faithfull Miniſters of Chriſt, to draw honour and reſpect upon themſelves, or that their perſons may be had in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration who are faithfull; this were a pittifull deſigne of holding
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:104248:201"/> out ſuch a truth; but it ſerves for this end, that the people of God may ſee, they have a bleſſing where any are faithfull; and may learne how they ought to prize thoſe faithfull meſſengers, whom the Lord ſends among them, yea how readily they ſhould receive the grace of God which is tendred in their miniſtry. Theſe are not only each of them, <hi>one meſſenger,</hi> or <hi>interpreter, but each one of them is one of a thouſand.</hi> A ſoule-convincing, converting, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, comforting Miniſter of the Goſpel is worth thouſands, and <hi>one among a thouſand.</hi> The Prophet ſaith (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 52.7.) <hi>How beautifull are the feet of them that bring glad tideings,</hi> &amp;c. By their feet he meaneth their <hi>coming,</hi> feete being the inſtruments of their coming to bring this glad tideings; yet when he ſaith, <hi>their feete are beautifull,</hi> it may have a greater emphaſis, for (the feete being the loweſt part of the ſtructure of mans body) it may intend thus much, that even that which is loweſt and meaneſt in a meſſenger of the Goſpel, his feete wearied and wet, yea foule and dirty with travel, have a beauty upon them, how much more his face and countenance; for if the very feete of ſuch news-bringers, of ſuch meſſengers, and interpreters, ſhould be acceptable and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (ſo beauty is) to all men, how much more ſhould their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and moſt of all their meſſage and tideings be? And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, if men did but underſtand it, they would acknowledge, that God hath committed ſuch a treaſury to them, as is better and more beautifull, then all the gold and precious things of this world, and would cry out, O what a mercy is it to have ſuch a News-bringer? and what Greedy News-mongers would they be? The <hi>one among a thouſand</hi> would be more deſirable then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of Gold and Silver.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> having deſcribed the perſon, whom the Lord often makes inſtrumentall for the reſtoring and comforting of the ſick ſinner, calling him <hi>A meſſenger, an interpreter, one of a thouſand</hi> (which latter may be applicable to both the former) proceeds to ſhew the buſineſs of this meſſenger, or interpreter, who is one of a thouſand, more expreſſely, or to ſet out what his worke is, ſurely excellent, and glorious worke, even this
<q>To ſhew unto man his uprightneſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are not to underſtand this ſhewing for a bare report of the thing; in which ſenſe the Prophet complain'd; <hi>Lord who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:104248:202"/> our report!</hi> (Iſa: 53.1.) that is, we have ſhewed good things to the world, but who hath believed us? The <hi>ſhewing</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by <hi>Elihu,</hi> is not a bare declaration of the matter to the eare, but an effectuall, and powerfull impreſſion of it upon the heart. Such a ſhewing as is ſpoken of at the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of this Chapter, <hi>then he openeth the eares of men;</hi> The Lord ſpeakes ſo by his meſſengers, and interpreters, that he not only makes the eare heare, but the heart too. The heart heares when we have a ſenſe, and are under the power of what is heard. As before we had a ſpirituall interpreter, ſo here we have a ſpirituall ſhewing of his interpretation. Here's a heavenly meſſenger, and a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly meſſage to <hi>the earthly man; To tell the earthly his right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs,</hi> ſaith Mr <hi>Broughton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, becauſe of the pronoune, <hi>[his] his uprightneſs;</hi> It may be demanded whoſe uprightneſs he meanes? or, what this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs is, which the interpreter ſheweth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some expound it of Gods uprightneſs, and then the ſenſe runs thus; God ſendeth an Interpreter to <hi>ſhew unto man his uprightneſs,</hi> that is, his own right and juſt dealing with man; As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſayd, Gods meſſenger ſhall convince this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled man that God doth not wrong him, how much ſoever he doth afflict him, or that God is upright and faithful in his dealing with him. This <hi>David</hi> acknowledged (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 119.75.) <hi>In faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs thou haſt afflicted me;</hi> that's a good ſenſe of the words, and very ſutable to the purpoſe of <hi>Elihu,</hi> who was about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince <hi>Job</hi> that his complainings were very ſinfull and uncomely, ſeeing God neither had nor would, nor, indeed, could doe him any wrong. God is faithfull, juſt, and right, yea, God is good and mercifull to man, when he corrects him ſore. Mr <hi>Broughton</hi> gives this interpretation of his own tranſlation; <hi>To tell the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his rightfullneſs,</hi> that is, <hi>God his mercy.</hi> The uprightneſs of God is that by which he doth righteous things.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Equitatem il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi> i. e. dei, qua omnia et nominatim ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſos laborantes regit et guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. <hi>Jun:</hi>
                     </note> This uprightneſs of God conſiſts not only in his holineſs, in his love of that which is good, and in his hatred of evill, but alſo in his preſervation of man according to his word of promiſe. 'Tis the righteouſneſs of God, that through the death and interceſſion of his Son, he ſhould ſave and heale the believing and repenting ſick ſinner.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, And more clearely (as I conceive) to the preſent ſcope of this place; the Antecedent to <hi>His,</hi> is the ſick man; And
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:104248:202"/> then, <hi>to ſhew unto man his uprightneſs,</hi> is to ſhew him his <hi>owne</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay; Is the meſſenger or interpreter, only to tell man how good he is, and what good he hath done? and ſo to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him into a good opinion of himſelfe, or of his owne good deeds?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; This <hi>ſhewing unto man his uprightneſs,</hi> may be taken</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As implying the mans ignorance of that uprightneſs which he hath; or that he hath an uprightneſs, but doth not know nor underſtand that he hath it. 'Tis ſo ſometimes with the ſound godly man, as well as with the ſicke, when (though in bodyly health, yet) he is diſcompoſed and troubled in mind; For then though he hath an uprightneſs of heart, an integrity towards God, or (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes of himſelfe) <hi>the root of the matter in him;</hi> that is, though he be truely converted and really godly, yet he ſeeth it not, ſuch temptations of Satan and troubles of mind aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault him, ſuch clouds of doubt, and darkneſs are upon him, that he is not able to make out his owne ſtate. In this caſe the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meſſenger or interpreter coming to him, and inquiring how it is with him, picks out this from him, that there is an uprightneſs, and an integrity of heart in him towards God, and that his ſtate is good, though he cannot diſcerne it. For as the life and ſtate of grace, is alwayes a ſecret to thoſe who have it not; ſo 'tis often a ſecret to thoſe that have it. Some men, never, few men alwayes underſtand their own condition, and 'tis very hard to make them underſtand it. For as it is with many hypocrites, and with all preſumptuous ones, you cannot beat them out of a good opinion of themſelves; though they are ſtark naught, rotten at heart, and have nothing to ſalve themſelves up with, but a little boldneſs and confidence, yet they will not be perſwaded off from their falſe foundations, and deceitfull bottoms; they will be good in their owne eyes, upright in their owne opinion, and doe not doubt but all's well with them, and will be well with them alwayes. Now, I ſay, as it is with ſome hypocrites, and all preſumptuous ones, they thinke themſelves to have an uprightneſs which they have not; ſo many are upright and ſincere, who ſee it not, and 'tis a very hard worke, the hardeſt worke that the Miniſters of the Goſpel have to make them underſtand and ſee their owne <hi>uprightneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:104248:203"/>
                  <p>Secondly, The word <hi>uprightneſs,</hi> and the <hi>ſhewing unto man his uprightneſs</hi> here ſpoken of,<note place="margin">Quid ipſum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere pro officio oporteat. <hi>Bez:</hi> Quid hominem agere, aequum ſit, <hi>ſc:</hi> ut agnitis peccatis dei gratiam prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter merita ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatoris implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret. <hi>Scult.</hi>
                     </note> takes in the whole duty, yea and the whole priviledge and intereſt of a Godly man, or that which will be his <hi>uprightneſs</hi> and ſet him right both before God and his owne conſcience. To ſhew unto man this his uprightneſs, is to ſhew him when he is right, and how he may be ſetled in a right ſtate; in ſuch a ſtate as will be to him like Mount <hi>Sion</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be removed. Thus the uprightneſs of man comprehends the whole buſineſs both of faith and repentance, or all that which a ſinner is called both to doe, and believe, for the repayring and mending of his loſt and ruin'd ſtate, for the putting and ſettleing him in ſuch a ſtate as the Lord may owne him as his, and be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to him. This, whatſoever it is, is mans uprightneſs or righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and the ſhewing unto man, this his uprightneſs is the bringing him word in the name of Chriſt, that God juſtifieth him from the guilt of all his ſins, and accepteth him into his favour.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>The great duty of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, is to cleare up to man, whether he be upright, or how he may ſtand upright with God.</q>
                  <p>This obſervation takes in both parts of the expoſition. To ſhew unto man how it is with him, what his preſent ſtate, and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, and to ſhew unto man what he ought to be, or how he may be in a ſafe condition, this is the worke of that meſſenger and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter who is one among a thouſand, this is a bleſſed worke, and thus it muſt be done.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Man is to be ſhewed <hi>the uprightneſs</hi> of his ſtate, or that which muſt be and be had to make up the uprightneſs of his ſtate, which is</p>
                  <p>Firſt, His <hi>first-repentance,</hi> or converſion to God. Fallen man can never come into a right ſtate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> till he returne to God from whom he fell. A mans ſinfull ſtate is a crooked, perverſe, and wretched ſtate; repentance or returning to God, is the bringing of a man right againe, it brings him to his uprightneſs, even to that ſtate, wherein he was firſt made; <hi>Loe this have I found</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccl: 7.19.) <hi>that God hath made man upright; but they have ſought out many inventions. Solomon</hi> doth not diſcover the ſeverall branches and ſtreames of mans ſinfullneſs, but the roote and ſpring of it he doth, the corruption of his nature by the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:104248:203"/> fall. For as he found that God made man upright, ſo mutable, ſubject to temptation, and as eaſily yeilding to the temptation, as admitting himſelfe to be tempted: and ſo, not reſting in that way and meanes of happineſs (as the Devil his tempter did not) which the wiſdome and goodneſs of God had chalked out and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to him, but conceiting to himſelfe a higher perfection, he then began and ſtill continueth to ſeeke out variety of meanes (called by <hi>Solomon, many inventions</hi>) as then to get more then he had, ſo now to regaine ſome ſhadow at leaſt of what he had. Theſe inventions, are all thoſe carnall ſhifts, whereby man hopes either to palliate his ſin, or to pacifie his conſcience. But all prove vaine inventions; there being no poſſibility now, for man to get out of ſin, or to goe back to God, and ſo to his firſt eſtate, but by repentance; That's Gods invention, and he hath concluded, that nothing without that ſhall bring man (the caſe of infants is another thing) to that ſtate of uprightneſs, in which he was firſt made. And therefore the Apoſtle giving an account of his miniſtry, how he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a meſſenger, or an intepreter (He indeed was one among a thouſand) ſaith (<hi>Acts</hi> 20.20, 21.) <hi>I kept back nothing that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>teſtifying both to the Jews, &amp; alſo to the Greekes, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing wherein this uprightneſs of mans ſtate doth conſiſt. Theſe two, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, were the ſumme of all thoſe Sermons in which <hi>Paul</hi> gave counſel both to Jewes and Gentiles what to doe that they might be ſaved. And this is the worke of all Goſpel <hi>Miniſters in ſhewing unto man his uprightneſs.</hi> He that is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and believeth, he that turneth from ſin, and taketh hold of Jeſus Chriſt by faith for righteouſneſs, is in a better ſtate of uprightneſs, then when he was firſt made upright. The Prophet (<hi>Hab:</hi> 2.4.) ſpeaking of faith, and that which is oppoſite to it ſelfe-confidence, uſeth this word, <hi>Behold his ſoule which is lifted up</hi> (namely in thoughts of any ſelfe or creature-ſufficiency) <hi>is not upright in him.</hi> A proud ſoule is not an upright ſoule. What is pride? ſurely this, for a man to thinke himſelfe in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or that he is well enough, that he wants nothing, as it is ſayd of the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> (Rev: 3.17.) when yet he is empty and guilty, poore and peny-leſſe in ſpiritualls, wanting
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:104248:204"/> every thing, eſpecially a ſight and ſence of his poverty and wants; yet this is every mans thought of himſelfe, till he is ſhewed what is <hi>indeed his uprightneſs.</hi> The naturall mans ſpirit is lifted up, not to God nor in God by faith and repentance, but in himſelfe. <hi>The ſoule thus lifted up is not upright</hi> (ſaith the Prophet, and what faith he next?) <hi>But the juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi> As if he had ſayd; <hi>The man that lives by faith, or the man that believes, and ſo lives upon Chriſt, is upright and hath an uprightneſs which will hold him right,</hi> which the uprightneſs of creation did not. Then the whole matter of mans uprightneſs was in himſelfe, and he was to ſtand upon his own bottom, having no promiſe of ſupport. But now the maine matter of mans uprightneſs is out of himſelfe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, himſelfe hath a promiſe to be ſupported in his uprightneſs. Man by the grace of repentance, turning from ſin, and by the grace of faith cloſing with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is ſet right in the Court of heaven, and ſhall be preſerved (in his uprightneſs) by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Againe, When man is ſhewed his uprightneſs as to his ſtate, which is his life of juſtification; then he muſt alſo be ſhewed his uprightneſs as to his way or courſe of life in <hi>ſanctification, or holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of converſation.</hi> The interpreter muſt not only bring man to Chriſt, but muſt tell him how he ought to walke in Chriſt. Man being ſet right, ought to goe right, or (as 'tis ſayd, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 50.23.) <hi>To order his converſation aright.</hi> Mans uprightneſs in walking and working is an inſeparable fruit of his uprightneſs in Being.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The buſineſs of the interpreter, is not only to bring the troubled ſoul to a true ſence of ſin, to a cleare ſight of Chriſt, and a ſutable converſation, but to furniſh him with weapons to reſiſt Satans temptations, to ſhew him how to mannage <hi>the ſword of the Spirit, and the ſhield of faith, that he may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the Devill;</hi> as alſo to anſwer, reſolve, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the doubts and ſcruples, that may ariſe in or are upon his owne conſcience, and ſo to ſettle him in a ſweet and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dependance upon Chriſt by faith as his uprightneſs and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, againſt all the feares which at any time aſſault his peace.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, Should not ſinners be ſhewed their un-uprightneſs or unrighteouſneſs, rather then their upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:104248:204"/>
                  <p>I anſwer; Firſt, 'Tis a peice of our ſhewing man his upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to ſhew him that he hath no uprightneſs. The Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth, firſt, of ſin, and then of righteouſneſs (<hi>John</hi> 16.8.) Secondly, I anſwer, a mans uprightneſs (according to the meaning of this Scripture) cannot be ſhewed him, but he muſt alſo be ſhewed his unrighteouſneſs. Thirdly, I anſwer, The ſick man here ſpoken of, may be ſuppoſed a man troubled in mind about his ſins; and in that caſe the interpreters duty is to eaſe his mind by ſhewing him his uprightneſs in the way opened, rather then to burden his mind further by ſhewing him his ſin or unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And therefore laſtly,</p>
                  <p>To cloſe this poynt with a word of caution; When <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeakes of an uprightneſs to be ſhewed the troubled ſoule; 'Tis not, that the meſſenger who comes to relieve and comfort him, ſhould uſe flattering words, and blow him up with a conceit of his owne good workes, and ſo tell him a ſtory of his vertues or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous deeds. No, the uprightneſs chiefly intended here is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, in and by which we are reconciled to and made one with God. Nor can we ever attaine to this till we are made ſencible of our owne nothingneſs, till we are unhinged of ſelfe, and quite taken off from any bottoming upon our owne righteouſneſs. Some, when they have trouble of conſcience upon them, what doe they? they fly to their owne righteouſneſſe; And when they are ſick, and ready to dye, how doe they prepare to ſtand right before God? they confeſs they have ſinned, and done amiſſe, but they hope they have repented, and made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for that; yea they can remember they have done ſuch, and ſuch, poſſibly, many good things, they have been juſt to all men, and charitable to the poore, they have heard the word, and been at many a good Sermon, they have prayed and faſted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus they patch up the buſineſs, as if this were their <hi>only uprightneſs,</hi> whereas, indeed, their only uprightneſs is the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt. We never ſee where our uprightneſs is, till we ſee there is nothing that makes us ſtand upright in the court of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but only Chriſt our righteouſneſs. This is the great duty of the meſſengers, and interpreters of Chriſt, to declare to man this righteouſneſs for his uprightneſs. And that hence it is (as <hi>Elihu</hi> proceeds in the next verſe to aſſure the ſick man) that God is and will be gracious to him.</p>

                  <p>In the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of this Booke at the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>Job</hi> uſeth this word in his application to his friends, for their pitty to him, and more favourable dealing with him; <hi>Have pitty upon me, have pitty upon me, O my friends, for the hand of God hath touched me.</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>The hand of God preſſeth me ſore, O let not your
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:104248:205"/> hand be heavie upon me too.</hi> This expoſition carrieth a great truth in it, and is not at all inconſiſtent with the letter of the text; yet I ſhall not inſiſt upon it, but adhere rather to a third, which makes the antecedent to this <hi>[He]</hi> to be God himſelfe.</p>
                  <q>Then he is gracious.</q>
                  <p>That is, when the meſſenger hath dealt with the ſick man, when he hath opened his condition to him, and ſhewed him his upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or how he may ſtand upright before God, or what his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is before God, and hath brought his heart to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned ſorrow for his ſin, and to the actings of faith upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; then God is gracious, and then he gives out the word for his reſtoring, and orders it to be preſently diſpatcht away to him, ſaying, <hi>deliver him, unlooſe him, unbind him, let him not goe downe into the pit, I have found a ranſome.</hi> Taking this for the generall ſence of the Text, I ſhall proceed to open the particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then he will be gracious,</hi> or then, <hi>he will have mercy upon him,</hi> as Mr <hi>Broughton</hi> tranſlates. Then and not before; till then the Lord lets his bones ake, and his heart tremble, till then he ſuffers him to be brought ſo low that he is reckoned among the dead, but then, though not before, he ſheweth himſelf gracious unto him. When a poor man is reduced to the utmoſt extreamity, then is Gods opportunity, then is the ſeaſon of mercy; and the Lord therefore lets us be at the loweſt, that we may be the more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible of his goodneſs in raiſing and lifting us up: The Lord ſuffers many (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of himſelf, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9.) <hi>to have the ſentence of death in themſelves, that they may learn not to truſt in themſelves, but in him who raiſeth the dead.</hi> We ſeldome give God either the glory of his power by truſting him, or of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by thanking him for our deliverances, till we are brought to the <hi>laſt caſt</hi> (as we ſay) or to ſuch an exigent as leaves no viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes in probabillity, no nor of poſſibility to eſcape.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Then he is gracious,</hi> that is, when the man is doubly humbled, when the mans heart is graciouſly broken, when the man is growne into an abhorrence of himſelf and of his ſin, or loathes himſelf for his ſin, as much as he loathed his meat, as 'tis ſaid in the former verſe; when his heart is thus taken quire off from all that is below in the world, and gathered up beleevingly

                  <p>Againe, When it is ſaid, then <hi>he</hi> (or, <hi>the Lord) is gracious,</hi> it may be taken two wayes. Firſt, as, to be gracious implyeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall graciouſneſs of his nature, or that mercifullneſs and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which dwells in the heart of God, and which indeed is God, (for the graciouſneſſe of God is the gracious God) thus God is alwayes and altogether gracious, he is infinitely and unceſſantly gracious. Secondly, when it is ſaid, <hi>he is gracious,</hi> it may note on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the graciouſneſs of his acts, and diſpenſations; thus, as I may ſay, the Lord is gracious <hi>(ad hinc et nunc)</hi> as he ſees cauſe, at this time he is gracious and not at that time; that is, he puts forth acts of grace now, and not then. The Lord puts forth acts of grace, both according to the pleaſure of his own will, without reſpect to any thing in man, as alſo without reſpecting what man is or doth, according to his pleaſure. And thus we are chiefly to underſtand it here; <hi>then he is gracious.</hi> God is gracious in his nature alwayes, and alwayes alike gracious; but he is not alwayes alike gracious in his diſpenſations, or in giving forth acts of grace; he is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to man according to his ſecret will as he pleaſeth, but he is gracious according to his revealed will as man pleaſeth him.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve, firſt.</p>
                  <q>The firſt cauſe and ſpring of all our mercies is the graciouſneſſe of God. <hi>Or,</hi> All our mercyes flow out from the grace of God.</q>
                  <p>That's the fountaine, yea that's the Ocean which ſeeds and fills all the Channels of mercy, which ſtream to us, as our happineſs in this world, and for our everlaſting happineſs in the world which is to come. All is of grace fundamentally, or becauſe the Lord is and will be for ever gracious. Thus the Lord ſpake to <hi>Moſes (Exod.</hi> 33.19.) <hi>I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious.</hi> My mercy ſhall flow our, when, and to whom, and where I pleaſe. And the proclamation which he made of himſelfe in all his royall Titles runs in the ſame ſtraine (<hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6.) <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, mercifull, and gracious, long-ſuffering, and aboundant in
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:104248:207"/> goodneſſe and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity.</hi> If we conſider God, firſt in doing us good; Secondly, in forgiving us the evill which we doe; Thirdly, in delivering us from the evills which we now ſuffer; Fourthly, in delivering us from the feare of future ſufferings; all is from grace and from free grace. He doth us good though we are undeſerving any good, that's grace, yea, he doth us good though we are ill deſerving, and that's more grace. He doth all for us through grace, Firſt, in ſpiritualls, and Secondly, in temporalls; not only doe the good things of eternall life, but the good things of this preſent life flow from grace unto his own people. Not only the health of their ſouls, but the health of their bodyes, not only deliverance from hell, but deliverance from ſickneſs alſo, flow from his free grace in Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore of all their mercies and ſalvations (both as to the foundation and top-ſtone of them) the people of God muſt cry (as the Prophet <hi>Zachery (Chap.</hi> 4.7.) foretells the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God ſhould ſay of that longed for deliverance, when <hi>that great mountaine ſhould become a plain before Zerubbabell) grace, grace, unto them:</hi> That is, grace hath begun them, and grace alone will maintaine, continue, and perfect what it hath begun. As there is nothing in us (except our miſery) which moves the Lord to begin, ſo there is nothing in us (but our inability) which moves the Lord to perfect what he hath begun. He ſeeth we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, and therefore he will perfect what he hath begun, and all this he doth that he may exalt his own name, and perfect the praiſe of his free grace towards us.</p>
                  <p>More diſtinctly, that all comes from grace, or from the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, may note theſe five things to us. Firſt, not only that God doth all for his people freely, or without deſert. But Secondly, that he doth all things willingly, or without conſtraint for his people. Thirdly, that he doth all things forwardly for his people. He doth very much unaskt and unſought, and he is not much askt or hardly drawne to doe any thing for his people. Though he hath ſaid of ſome things, <hi>I will be ſought unto, or inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after that I may doe them for you, (Ezek.</hi> 36.37.) yet his mercies are never forced nor wreſted from him by intreaties, but flow from a principle of love, naturally, as water out of a fountain. Fourthly, he doth all rejoycingly, <hi>even with his whole heart, and with his whole ſoul. Mercy pleaſeth him,</hi> and he is pleaſed with
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:104248:207"/> occaſions of ſhewing mercy, 'tis no burden to him to doe us good; mercy proceeds from his nature, and therefore he delighteth in mercy (<hi>Mic:</hi> 7.18.) yea, to be mercifull is his nature, and therefore he cannot but delight in it. Fifthly, graciouſneſs being the very nature of God, implyeth that he will do us good liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and conſtantly, or that (as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks) he giveth liberally, and upbraideth not; he doth not upbraid us with our poverty, who receive, nor do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h he upbraid us with the riches of the gifts which himſelf beſtoweth; And becauſe they flow from his nature, therefore he doth not in the leaſt emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty himſelf, how much ſoever he fills the creature with his gifts or goodneſs. Some men (upon the matter) even exhauſt and undoe themſelves by liberallity unto others; and they who give moſt, or have moſt to give, cannot alwayes give. It is ſaid in this Book, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 37.11.) <hi>By watering, he wearieth the thick cloud;</hi> that is, God commandeth the cloud to give raine ſo long, that it hath not a drop more to give, but is quite ſpent. Springs or fountaines are never wearied or ſpent with watering, becauſe their waters come as freely and as faſt as they goe; God is an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpring of grace and goodneſs; He is not wearyed, nor emptyed by what he giveth out to, or doth for the creature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all floweth from his naturall graciouſneſſe as from a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then he is gracious.</hi> I would urge the ſecond reference of that word <hi>(then)</hi> a little further; It was ſhewed before, that it might refer, Firſt, to the extreamity of the ſick man, Secondly, to the ſick mans humiliation, or the right diſpoſure of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to receive renewed acts of grace, and favour from the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve, Secondly.</p>
                  <q>God uſually diſpenſeth or giveth out acts of grace when we repent and turne from ſin,<note place="margin">Si aegrotus ille monitis illius nuncij paruerit ac proinde reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puerit, tum <hi>&amp;c. Piſc:</hi>
                     </note> when we believe and lay hold upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; Then he is gracious.</q>
                  <p>It is ſaid (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18.) <hi>Therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious.</hi> The Lord hath alwayes a gracious diſpoſition, a gracious nature; he alwayes hath a ſtore and a ſtocke, a rich ſtocke and ſtore of mercy by him; but he doth not alwayes give it forth; no, <hi>he waits to be gracious,</hi> that is, he waits till we are in
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:104248:208"/> a fit frame, till we are in a due temper to receive his grace. And becauſe as to the diſpenſings of grace, God waits to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; therefore many retard and hinder their owne good; they are not yet in a frame to receive; their veſſell is not yet ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hold mercy. The Lord waited to be gracious to <hi>David</hi> after his grievous fall, and therefore he did not give <hi>Nathan</hi> a Commiſſion to ſay, <hi>Thy ſin is done away,</hi> till <hi>Davids</hi> heart was broken, and had ſaid (2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 12.13.) <hi>I have ſinned againſt the Lord;</hi> But when once that word fell from him, then <hi>Nathan</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared how gracious the Lord was to him. As ſoone as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I have ſinned</hi> (that's an act of repentance) preſently, <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaid, <hi>the Lord hath done away thy ſin,</hi> that's an act of grace. When did <hi>Ephraim</hi> heare a word of comfort from God? The Prophet tells us (<hi>Jer:</hi> 31.18, 19, 20.) <hi>I have heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelfe,</hi> (that is, mourning over and bewayling his ſin) <hi>ſaying, thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoake.</hi> We have him there alſo praying, <hi>Turne me, O Lord, and I ſhall be turned,</hi> &amp;c. Upon this, how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, how meltingly did the Lord ſpeak? <hi>Is Ephraim my deare ſon? is he a pleaſant child? ſince I ſpake againſt him, I doe earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remember him ſtill,</hi> (or, <hi>in remembring I remember him) my bowells are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy on him.</hi> Now I will manifeſt my grace, and acquaint him with my good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Lord was very gracious to <hi>Saul</hi> afterwards <hi>Paul,</hi> he ſent <hi>Ananias</hi> to him with a meſſage of mercy, as to reſtore the ſight of his bodyly eyes, ſo to aſſure him that he ſhould be an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the hand of Chriſt to open the eyes of many, <hi>and a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen veſſel to beare his name before the Gentiles and Kings and the Children of Iſrael,</hi> (Acts 9.15.) But when was this meſſage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him? the text tells us (<hi>v.</hi> 11.) <hi>For behold he prayeth;</hi> the man is in the duſt, he is brought upon his knees, his ſpirit is broken; that word <hi>he prayeth,</hi> comprehends the whole worke of a gracious ſoule, as to his humiliation and returning to the Lord. In the parable of the prodigall Son, his father is repreſented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly gracious to him; but he did not ſignifie it, he did not ſend the ring, not the rich robe to him, when he was abroad in a ſtrange Country among harlots, drinking and waſting his eſtate, time and ſtrength vainely; we read of no acts of grace to him then, but when, being pinched with famine and hunger, he came
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:104248:208"/> to himſelfe, and began to bethink himſelfe of coming back to his fathers houſe, and that he had brought himſelfe by his own folly to beggery, and want, and husks; when he was upon theſe termes, or reſolves to goe home to his father, and caſt himſelfe at his feet as unworthy the name or priviledge of a Son, then his father ran to meete him, fell on his neck and kiſſed him, then he put on the ring, and cloathed him with the robe, then he killed the fatted calfe, and made a feaſt for him. All which ſceane of mercy doth but hold out this one word in the text; <hi>Then he is gracious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two ſorts of gracious acts of God. Firſt, ſome are acts of abſolute grace, or of preventing grace; Theſe are put forth upon and exerciſed towards the creature, before there is any the leſt preparation in the heart, to draw them out or invite the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. Thus, the grace of God in election is abſolutely free, there was no previſion of any qualification in man moving God to elect him. And ſo that wonderfull act of grace (in which electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on firſt deſcends and diſcovers it ſelfe) effectuall vocation, is abſolutely free. God calls a ſinner when he is in the heat and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his evill wayes, purſuing his luſts in the height of his pride, and in the hardneſs of his impenitent heart. Now, if when God firſt calleth a ſinner there is nothing in him but ſin; What can move God to call him but free grace? A third abſolute act of grace is juſtification; God doth not juſtifie a ſinner for any thing that he finds or ſees in us; As to us 'tis altogether free. <hi>He juſtifieth the ungodly</hi> (Rom: 4.5.) when that wretched infant was in its blood (which expreſſeth a miſerable uncleane poluted condition) <hi>then was a time of love</hi> (Ezek: 16.8.) then was God gracious. What lovelineſs was there in that infant (repreſenting the beſt of men in that fallen naturall eſtate) to draw out the love of God? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, yea ſhe was altogether unlovely, yet then (ſaith God) <hi>thy time was the time of love,</hi> or then was the time of putting forth love in her converſion and voc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tion; <hi>Then, I ſayd unto thee when thou waſt in thy blood, live.</hi> And becauſe the thing might ſeeme not only ſtrange, but even impoſſible, that the heart of God ſhould be towards ſuch a wretched one for good, the word is doubled, <hi>yea I ſayd unto the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, when thou waſt in thy blood, live.</hi> Theſe acts of abſolute free grace are the glory of the Covenant of grace; for if the Covenant ſhould hold out acts of Grace only upon our pre-diſpoſitions, when ſhould we receive any act of grace?
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:104248:209"/> The promiſe is not of this tenour, <hi>I will pardon them when their hearts are ſoft and tender;</hi> but, <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone, and give them a heart of fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet Secondly (as to the poynt in hand) there are conditionall acts of grace, I may call them ſecond acts of grace, or renewed acts of grace. For when after converſion we fall into ſin, and by that evill heart of unbeliefe (remaining in a great meaſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified) we depart from the living God (<hi>Heb:</hi> 3.12.) God doth not give out freſh acts of grace, but upon repentance, and the renewings of our communion with him. Having once received grace, we being again helped and aſſiſted by grace, act graciouſly, before God declares himſelfe gracious to us. When a man is caſt upon a ſick bed for ſin, (that's the caſe of many) the Lord will ſee repentance before he will raiſe him up againe. (<hi>James</hi> 5.15.) <hi>The prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſick, and if he hath committed ſins, they ſhall be forgiven him;</hi> that is, if he being caſt upon a ſick bed to correct or chaſten him for the ſin that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſhall humble himſelfe, and ſeek the Lord by prayer, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and calling for prayer; Then the ſin committed ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given him, and the Lord will raiſe him up againe. 'Tis not the prayer of another that can obtaine deliverance for the ſick, much leſſe the forgiveneſs of his ſins, if himſelfe be prayer-leſſe, and repentance-leſſe. But while others pray for the ſick mans bodyly health, they praying alſo for his ſoules health, the Lord gives him repentance for his ſin, and then a comfortable ſight of pardon. So then before the Lord puts out theſe ſecond acts of grace, he looks for and finds ſomething in the creature yet ſtill, that alſo is an effect of his grace both to them and in them. They, who have already received grace, muſt ſtir up their grace, and renew acts of grace (thorough grace) towards him, before he diſpenſes acts of grace towards them. And as conſolation in this life, ſo that higheſt and laſt act of grace, ſalvation, in the life to come, is not beſtow'd upon any, till they are fitted. God calls and converts the worſt of men, thoſe that are in their filth, and mud, and mire, but he will not ſave a filthy perſon, he will have him firſt purged and prepared. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdome of God</hi> (1 Cor: 6.9.) and that <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord</hi> (Heb: 12.14.) There is no eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation without preparation; nor is there any promiſe of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:104248:209"/> ſalvation without it. When a man is ſick to death (as in the text, ſalvation comes not, the Lord is not gracious till the ſick mans ſpirit is humbled and ſet right; till the meſſenger hath ſhewed him, how he may ſtand upright before the Lord, and he hath imbraced his meſſage; then, and not till then <hi>he is gracious.</hi> And as in theſe words we have the occaſion of this grace; ſo in the following words we have the publication of this grace; <hi>Then he is gracious.</hi>

                     <hi>[And ſaith]</hi> that is, the Lord gives out an order preſently, he gives out a warrant for the releaſe of the ſick man.

                  <p>But it may be queſtioned, for as much as the text ſaith only in general, <hi>deliver him,</hi> Into whoſe hands this warrant for his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance is delivered? or who is directed to deliver him? Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> repreſents God ſpeaking this to the ſick mans diſeaſe, for thus he renders the text; <hi>Then he will have mercy upon him, and ſay, Spare him (O killing malady) from deſcending into the pit.</hi> God will ſpeak thus to the diſeaſe (and there is a great ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy in it) <hi>ſpare him O killing malady.</hi> Diſeaſes come and goe at Gods command; they hurt and they ſpare at his direction; As the Lords breath or word bloweth away the winds (<hi>Math:</hi> 8.27.) <hi>The men marvelled, ſaying, Who is this that even the winde and the ſeas obey him?</hi> So the Lords breath bloweth away ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; if he doe but ſpeak to a diſeaſe, to a feaver, to an ague, to a dropſie, to a conſumption, <hi>O killing malady, ſpare him,</hi> thou haſt done enough (any diſeaſe might prevaile to death, did not God ſay, <hi>ſpare him</hi>) hold thy hand, not a blow more, not a fit more <hi>O killing malady.</hi> Death it ſelfe, much more ſickneſs, heareth the voyce of God.

                  <p>Secondly, I conceive this warrant for the deliverance of the ſick man, is given out to the <hi>meſſenger or interpreter, to the one among a thouſand,</hi> that viſiteth him in his ſickneſs. He having been with him, and dealt with his conſcience, he having brought him into a good frame, the Lord is gracious,<note place="margin">Sequeſtrem il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Jubebit ei renunciare im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petratum eſſe ſibi liberatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem. <hi>Bez:</hi>

The interpreter doth not deliver him, but tells him God will. We have the Pſalmiſt ſpeaking thus after his ſupplication and prayer made to the Lord for a ſick State or Nation or for a ſick Church (that's his ſcope, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 85.) <hi>Wilt thou not revive us againe, that thy people may rejoyc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Surely thou wilt, and he expreſſeth his confidence, that God would (<hi>v.</hi> 8.) <hi>I will heare what God the Lord will ſpeake, for he will ſpeak peace unto his people, and to his Saints.</hi> When he had prayed he would harken for news, or for a meſſage from heaven, whether or no, the Lord would or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him to ſpeak peace to thoſe for whom he had been praying, and ſay, <hi>deliver them from going downe to the pit.</hi> Thus did the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk, I will ſtand upon my watch, and ſet me upon my tower, and ſee what he will ſay unto me, and what I ſhall anſwer when I am reproved</hi> (Chap: 2.1.) In the next verſe, <hi>The Lord an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſayd, write the viſion and make it plaine upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.</hi> And what was the anſwer? ſurely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; for having ſayd, <hi>in the end it ſhall ſpeake and not lye</hi> (v. 3.) he concludes (<hi>v.</hi> 4.) <hi>The juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi> Believing deliverance, he ſhall at laſt be delivered from the pit of captivity and live.</p>
                  <p>Here in the text we muſt ſuppoſe this meſſenger had prayed, and having prayed, he did not neglect his prayer, but was heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what the Lord would ſay. <hi>Elihu</hi> was confident the Lord would give a gracious anſwer, though not by an immediate voyce or revelation to his eare, yet by an aſſurance of the mercy given into his ſpirit. When that good king <hi>Hezekiah, was not only ſick unto death,</hi> but had received an expreſſe meſſage from the Lord, <hi>Set thy houſe in order, for thou ſhalt dye and not live</hi> (2 Kings 20.1.) 'Tis ſayd at the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe, <hi>He turned his face to the wall, and
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:104248:211"/> prayed unto the Lord, ſaying,</hi> &amp;c. And at the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>The word of the Lord came to Iſaiah the Prophet, ſaying, turne againe, and tell Hezekiah the Captain of my people; Thus ſaith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have ſeene thy teares, behold, I will heale thee,</hi> &amp;c. Here God gave a word formally, and put it into the Prophets mouth, <hi>Goe deliver him from going downe to the pit.</hi> And though the Lord doth not thus now in ſuch an explicite and open way, nor may we expect it, yet there is a virtuall ſaying of this word from the Lord, and that ſometimes mightily impreſt upon the hearts of thoſe who have prayed and ſought unto him, for the ſick man, whereby (not by an unground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vaine confidence, but by a ſcripturall holy confidence, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the promiſe with the mans condition) they are enabled to tell him, <hi>The Lord hath delivered thee from going downe to the pit.</hi> And he ſhall as certainly be delivered, as if the Lord had ſent an expreſſe from heaven to tell him ſo. <hi>Then he is gracious to him, and ſaith, deliver him from going downe to the pit.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Death is a going to the pit, a going to deſtruction.</q>
                  <p>Thus it is ordinarily with all who dye, to the pit they goe. Many dye and goe downe to the bottomleſs pit; all who dye may be ſayd to goe to the pit. To goe to the bottomleſs pit, is the circumlocution of eternall death, as to goe to the pit is the circumlocution of temporall death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Foraſmuch as the man being ſick the Lord gives out this word, <hi>deliver him from going downe to the pit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>Sickneſs hath in it a tendency unto death.</q>
                  <p>The ſick ſtand as it were upon the borders of the grave. Some not only put death farr from them in health, but in their ſickneſs; untill they are even dead, they ſcarce thinke themſelves dying. It is good for us in our health and beſt ſtrength to be looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pit, and conſidering upon what grounds of comfort we can deſcend into the grave. How much more ſhould we be thinking of and looking into the pit, when we are in a languiſhing and dying condition?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="403" facs="tcp:104248:211"/>The word and work of deliverance is from God alone; Then he will be gracious and ſay, deliver him from going downe to the pit.</q>
                  <p>God can, and God only can deliver from death; no creature in heaven or earth can ſpeak this but by commiſſion from God; none can open this ſecret till God interpret it. Deliverance is the Lords ſalvation; and the word of ſalvation from ſickneſs, as well as of ſalvation from hell, comes out from the Lord.</p>
                  <p>But is it not ſayd (<hi>Pro:</hi> 11.4.) <hi>Righteouſneſs delivereth from death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer; when it is ſayd, <hi>Righteouſneſs delivereth from death,</hi> The meaning is, God delivereth the righteous from death. He delivereth them from the ſting and terror, from all that which is properly called the evill of corporall death; and he delivereth them wholly from the leaſt touch or ſhadow of eternall death. And this righteouſneſs which delivers from death is not our own, but the righteouſneſs of Chriſt made ours by the appoyntment of God, and received as ours by faith. 'Tis neither any righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wrought in us, nor any righteouſneſs wrought by us, but that righteouſneſs which is wrought for us, which delivereth from death: and that delivereth us from death, becauſe God ſaith of ſuch a righteous perſon, deliver him, as often from temporall death, or going downe to the pit of the grave, ſo alwayes from eternall death, or going downe to the pit of hell.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In that this word <hi>deliver him,</hi> is given to the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>God conveighs deliverance and mercy to us by men like our ſelves.</q>
                  <p>He will have the creature beholding to the creature for his mercy, though mercy come freely and only from himſelfe. God delivereth the ſick and the ſinner in ſuch a method that we may owne, though not ſtay in his meſſengers, as the inſtruments of his favour. God who can doe all things by himſelfe, will not doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things but by meanes. He ſaith to the meſſenger, <hi>Deliver him from going downe to the pit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You will ſay, How can a Miniſter or a Meſſenger deliver the ſick from going downe to the pit?</p>

                  <p>I anſwer, (as was touched before) he delivers him by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to him the minde of God, by acquainting the ſick with the promiſes of deliverance, and by preſſing him to believe and reſt upon them; by aſſuring him that as God is able to performe the promiſe, ſo he is faithfull and willing to performe it; yea that he hath given ſome tokens for good that he will deliver him from going downe to the pit. Thus the worke of Gods free grace, mercy, and power, is oftentimes attributed to inſtruments and ſecond cauſes, becauſe they have their place and uſe in the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the purpoſes of God for the good of his people. Hence ſome men are called <hi>Saviours; And Saviours ſhall come up on mount Zion</hi> (Obad: <hi>v.</hi> 21.) No man can ſave either from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall or eternall deſtruction; <hi>He that is our God is the God of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and unto God the Lord belong the iſſues from death</hi> (Pſ: 68.20.) yet ſaith the Prophet, <hi>there ſhall come Saviours;</hi> that is, God will rayſe up worthy men, <hi>principall men</hi> (as another Prophet cals them, <hi>Mic:</hi> 5.5.) who ſhall deſtroy <hi>Zions</hi> enemies. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> admoniſheth <hi>Timothy, Take heed to thy ſelfe, and to thy doctrine, continue in them, for in ſo doing thou ſhalt ſave thy ſelfe and them that heare thee</hi> (1 Tim: 4.16.) The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> (Chap: 5.20.) ſpeakes the ſame thing; <hi>He which converteth a ſinner from the errour of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoule from death, and ſhall hide a multitude of ſins.</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle faith (as to the caſe in the text) at the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of the ſame Chapter; <hi>The prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſicke.</hi> Though none can ſave, yet many are means of our ſalvation. And the Lord is pleaſed to honour thoſe who are the meanes of any ſalvation, ſo farre, as to ſay, <hi>They ſave.</hi> It is indeed the duty of all to aſcribe the all of every worke and piece of ſalvation and deliverance to God only. When the people ſtood wondering at <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> after they had healed the lame man, <hi>Peter</hi> anſwered (<hi>Acts</hi> 3.12.) <hi>Ye men of Iſrael, why marvel ye at this? or why looke ye ſo earneſtly on us, as if we by our own power or holineſs had made this man to walke. The God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>hath glorified his Son Jeſus;</hi> As if they had ſaid, Therefore doe ye alſo glorifie him, not us for delivering this lame man. Though God is pleaſed to put much honour upon man, by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what himſelfe doth, as if man had done it; yet he will not give the glory of what he doth to any man, nor may any take it. God ſaith to the meſſenger, <hi>deliver him from going downe to the
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:104248:213"/> pit;</hi> but woe to that meſſenger who ſaith (when he is delivered) I have delivered him from going downe to the pit.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee the ſpring of the ſick mans recovery, it is from the graciouſneſs of God, and we ſee the meanes of it, God gives a warrant to his meſſenger, ſaying, <hi>Deliver him from going down to the pit;</hi> But what is the procuring or meritorious cauſe of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance? As the Text hath ſhewed us the firſt moving cauſe, <hi>The grace of God,</hi> ſo it ſhewes us the meritorious cauſe, by which his deliverance is procured; Things are ſo ordered in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, that though the Lord acts with infinite freeneſs, yet he hath appointed and ordered a way in which alone he will doe, what he freely doth.

If we cover our own ſins we ſhall have no mercy, but if the Lord once cover our ſins, he cannot deny us mercy, that being it ſelf our greateſt mercy, and the fruit of his great mercy. <hi>The Mercy-ſeat,</hi> ſo famous in the Moſaicall Poedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogy, is expreſt by this word, which properly ſignifieth a <hi>Covering.</hi>
                     <pb n="406" facs="tcp:104248:214"/> The <hi>Mercy-ſeat</hi> was it ſelf a <hi>Covering of pure gold, laid over the Arke,</hi> in which Arke the Law was put (<hi>Exod.</hi> 25.17.21.) <hi>Thou ſhalt put the Mercy-ſeat above upon the Arke, and in the Ark thou ſhalt put the teſtimony that I ſhall give thee.</hi> And as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of the Arke were two Cubits and a halfe in length, and a Cubit and a half in breadth, ſo the ſame were the dimenſions of the Mercy-ſeat; (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 10.17.) which figured that as the Mercy-ſeat fully covered the Arke wherein the Law was, ſo Chriſt ſhould fully cover all our ſins, which are tranſgreſſions of the Law. The righteouſneſs of Chriſt is as long and as broad as the Law, and ſo, our ſins being covered with that ſhall never appeare againſt us. Therefore alſo <hi>from above this Mercy-ſeat between the two Cherubims</hi> (the Lord ſaid (<hi>verſ.</hi> 22.) <hi>I will meete thee, and I will commune with thee.</hi> There was a gracious manifeſtation of the preſence of God above the <hi>Mercy-ſeat,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that typified Jeſus Chriſt the true <hi>Propitiatory or ranſome,</hi> covering and hiding out of the ſight of God for ever all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections iniquities and tranſgreſſions. And hence the ſame word which ſignifies expiation or redemption, ſignifieth alſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing cauſe of our Redemption, here called (as alſo in the New Teſtament) <hi>A Ranſome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have found a Ranſome.</hi> A <hi>ranſome</hi> is properly a price deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for releaſe out of bondage. And when the Captive is relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the price is paid. To be redeemed and to be ranſomed is the ſame thing, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.9, 10.) <hi>The redeemed ſhall paſſe there, and the ranſomed of the Lord ſhall returne and come to Sion, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting joy upon their heads, they ſhall obtaine joy and gladneſs, and ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flee away.</hi>

To put theſe in place of a ranſome, or to hope for deliverance from the pit upon their account is to pervert the whole Goſpel.</p>

This ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the juſtice of God is only and wholly made by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> without any the leaſt contribution from man. The perfect ranſome which the Lord finds is the blood of his own Son, which is called the blood of the Covenant, becauſe thereby the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is confirmed, and all Covenant mercies aſſured to us. Upon this price or ranſome God reſtores the ſick ſinner and pardons him, he heales both his body and his ſoul. And that <hi>Job</hi> had knowledge of this ranſome as the only meanes of deliverance, appeares (<hi>Chap.</hi> 17.3.19.25.) <hi>Deliver him, for I have found a ranſome.</hi>

                  <p>Hence Obſerve, Firſt.</p>
                  <q>The redemption or deliverance of man by a ranſome is the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and the invention of God only.</q>
                  <p>If all men on earth, yea if all the Angells in Heaven had ſat from the foundation of the world to this day, in counſell beating their braines, and debating this queſtion, <hi>How man, ſinfull man might be delivered out of the hand of the Law, or from that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory ſentence under which the Law had caſt and detained him, with ſatisfaction, or without dammage to the Juſtice and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, they could never have found it out, nor any thing like it.

The thought of a ranſome in this way had never entred into the heart either of men or Angells, if God himſelf had not revealed it. Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> having ſpoken of the great diligence of the old Prophets ſearching into and inquiring about that great myſtery, the way and means of mans ſalvation, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> The word there uſed notes a curious prying into that which hath ſome veyled or ſecret rarity in it. We may conceive the Apoſtle in that word alluding to the Cherubims, which by Gods command, to <hi>Moſes,</hi> were made with their eyes looking downe to the Mercy-ſeat or propitiatory in <hi>the Holy of holyes</hi> (Exod. 25.20.) figuring the ranſome in the Text, yea and expreſſed by the ſame Hebrew word. The living Angells doe that which thoſe repreſentative Angells ſeemed to doe, they look earneſtly at the myſtery of our redemption made, or ranſome given by Jeſus Chriſt. There is ſuch an exquiſiteneſs in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, the deliverance of man by Chriſt, that the Angells de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to look into it, even as men deſire to ſee rare inventions. And this exceedingly commends the wiſdome of God in our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it was a ſecret to the very glorious Angells. They did not know it, but as it was made knowne to them; nor did God (as it ſeemes) make it knowne to them firſtly or immediately, but it was revealed to them, occaſionally by the revelation of it firſt to the Church; as the Apoſtle doth more then intimate, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10.) <hi>To the intent, that now unto principalities and powers in heavenly places,</hi> (that is the holy Angells) <hi>might be known by the Church the manifold wiſdome of God.</hi> As if, had it not been for the light given to and ſpread abroad in the Church, the Angells had been in the dark to this day about that matter. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs if the Angells did not gather up their knowledge of that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery by the miniſtery of the Apoſtles preaching it to the world, in a way of information, yet by their contemplation of what was done in the Church, &amp; of the goodneſs of God to the Church, they ſaw as in a glaſſe that manifold wiſdome of God which before they ſaw not, or were ignorant of. Now if the holy Angells knew not this myſtery, but as it was revealed, much leſſe could man. <hi>We</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8, 9.) <hi>ſpeake wiſdome
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:104248:215"/> among them that are perfect: yet not the wiſdome of this world, nor of the Princes of this world, that come to naught. But we ſpeak the wiſdome of God in a myſtery, &amp;c. which none of the Princes of this World know,</hi>

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle calls it not only a myſtery, but a great myſtery, and that there is not the leaſt queſtion, but 'tis a great myſtery. (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.) <hi>Without controverſie great is the myſtery of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, God manifeſt in the fleſh; this great myſtery, which from the beginning of the World hath been hid in God</hi> (Eph. 3.9.) that is in the counſell and decree of God, hath been alſo ſome way or other revealed by God almoſt as ſoon as the world began; It was revealed to <hi>Adam</hi> by the promiſe of the womans ſeed; and to <hi>Abraham</hi> by promiſe, that in his Seed all the Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed; It was revealed to the Church of the Jewes in Ceremonies and Propheſies, and it hath been revealed to the Church both of Jewes and Gentiles by the Spirit in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word, ever ſince Chriſt paid this ranſome to this day; and it had been hidden to this day, if the Lord had not revealed it; 'tis therefore the <hi>Lords invention.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let me add this by way of inference. We honour men that bring forth any rare invention. And if it be an invention which alſo produceth profit and advantage to mankind, how are the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of it admired, and their names recorded? All the inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the moſt refined wits in the world, are dull pieces to <hi>this invention,</hi> the redemption of man by Chriſt. And as there is the ſtamp of an infinite unchangeable wiſdome upon it; ſo the profit which comes in by it to mankind is infinite and ineſtimable. How then ſhould we honour God, both for bringing this wonderfull invention to light, and giving us the benefit of it freely! It had been great mercy if God had delivered us upon our finding out and propoſall of a way to him; but he hath not only delivered us, but found out a way himſelf, and plotted how we might be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. What a glorious mercy is this! When <hi>Darius</hi> ſaw how <hi>Daniel</hi> was inſnared by his act or decree, he was extreamly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and (ſaith the Text, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.14.) he <hi>was ſore diſpleaſed
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:104248:216"/> with himſelfe, and ſet his heart on Daniel to deliver him, and he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured</hi> (beating his braines and ſtudying) <hi>till the going down of the Sun to deliver him,</hi> yet could not, but caſt he was to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Lions, only he told him, (<hi>verſ.</hi> 16.) <hi>Thy God whom thou ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt continually, he will deliver thee. Darius</hi> could not find a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, any meanes of deliverance for his ſervant and great Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite <hi>Daniel.</hi> But when we had brought ourſelves into a ſnare, and muſt have been caſt to the Lions for ever, to be torne by them, the Lord brought forth this rare invention, a ranſome, whereby we poor ſinners are delivered out of the mouth <hi>of the roaring Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who goeth about continually to devoure us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Inaſmuch as deliverance is got by ranſome.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Our deliverance is coſtly.</q>
                  <p>Soules are precious, they are dear ware; Blood, and that the blood of Chriſt is their ranſome; (<hi>Math.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9.) in compariſon of which all the treaſures of this world are traſh, our Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver corruptible, and our very righteouſneſs a corrupt thing. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances are obtained three wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By power or plaine force; thus <hi>Abraham</hi> delivered his Nephew <hi>Lot</hi> when he was carryed captive (<hi>Gen.</hi> 14.14.) <hi>He armed his trained ſervants, born in his houſe three hundred and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,</hi> and reſcued him. I may ſay, the Lord Jeſus hath delivered us thus, even by force and power, he hath beaten all our enemies, and having broken and <hi>ſpoyled principallities and powers, he made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them in it</hi> (his Croſſe ſpoken of in the former verſe) <hi>or in himſelfe;</hi> that is, in his own perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall power, not by any aide or forreigne aſſiſtance received from men or Angells.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Deliverance is obtained by price or payment. When our friends or country-men are taken Captives by <hi>Turkes</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we cannot ſend an Army to reſcue them, but uſually we doe it by ranſome; we buy them againe out of the enemies hand, or out of bondage. Jeſus Chriſt hath delivered us, not only by power, but by price, it was not (as hath been already ſhewed) by gold or ſilver, but by his own moſt precious blood, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18.) Jeſus Chriſt hath delivered us out of the ſoul deſtroying hand of
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:104248:216"/> Satan by force, but he delivers us out of the ſin-revenging hand of his Father by price. Chriſt owed the Devill nothing (nor doe we) but blowes, but having undertaken our cauſe, he owed his Father as much as our debt and deliverance from it amounted to, a vaſt ſumme, yet he had enough to anſwer it to the utmoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and did, and ſo delivered us.</p>
                  <p>There is a third way of deliverance, and that is by ſupplication and interceſſion, which may be conſidered two wayes, Firſt, by our own prayers and ſupplications; Secondly, by the prayers and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of others; which prayers of others are properly called interceſſions. The interceſſion of a man with man may deliver him from the wrath of a man. And the interceſſion of a man with God, hath wrought the temporall deliverance of ſome both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and Nations; and therefore when the Lord was reſolved not to ſpare his people, he forbad the interceſſion of the Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 14.11.) <hi>Pray not for this people for their good:</hi> And he profeſſed (<hi>Jer.</hi> 15.1.) <hi>Though Moſes and Samuel</hi> (thoſe two mighty Advocates) <hi>ſtood before me</hi> (praying he meanes for them) <hi>yet my mind could not be towards this people, cast them out of my ſight;</hi> In that God would not deliver his people upon their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, is an argument that he often doth. But 'tis the interceſſion of Chriſt alone which carryeth it with God (and that alwayes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth it, for the Father alwayes heareth him, that is, granteth his requeſts) for the deliverance of his people both from temporall ſpirituall and eternall evills. This interceſſion of Chriſt is the fruit of his blood ſhed, or of the ranſome paid down for us. For as his blood purchaſeth our deliverance, ſo by his interceſſion it is given in or applyed to us. We have the impetration of our pardon by Chriſts ſufferings, and the application of it, by Chriſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding for us. So then, we are delivered both by power, and price, and prayer, in ſeverall and diſtinct reſpects; But the preſent text ſpeaks of deliverance only by a price, <hi>I have found a ranſome,</hi> I am well paid, ſaith God, for mans deliverance. This ranſome every poor ſoul may plead before the Lord, for his deliverance both from ſickneſs death and hell. He that hath nothing to offer to the Lord (as indeed the beſt have nothing of their own worth the offering, and if they offer any thing of their own, of how much worth ſoever it may ſeem to be, it will not paſſe nor be accepted, he (I ſay) that hath nothing of his own to offer) yet may tell
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:104248:217"/> him he ſhall be well paid; he may tell God, he ſhall have more by ſaving him, then by damning him. If he damne him he ſhall have but his own blood (the blood of a creature) for ſatisfaction; but if he ſave him, he ſhall have the blood of his Son, the blood of God, as a ranſome for his ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Though the Goſpel was not clearly and fully revealed in thoſe elder times, yet it was then ſavingly revealed.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How doth the grace of God ſhine forth in mans deliverance by a ranſome,</hi> in this Scripture; Here is nothing ſaid of deliverance from ſickneſs by medicines, but by a ranſome; and if they knew that deliverance from a diſeaſe muſt come in by a ranſome, how much more, that deliverance from damnation muſt come in that way? The old Patriarkes had the knowledge of Chriſt to come, and not only was there a knowledge of him to come in that nation and Church of the Jewes, but the light ſcattered abroad, the Land of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z.</hi> had it, <hi>Job</hi> had it, as hath appeared from ſeverall paſſages of this Booke, <hi>Elihu</hi> had it as appeareth by this.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Not only our eternall deliverances, but even our temporall delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances and mercies, are purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt.</q>
                  <p>A beleever doth not eate a bit of bread, but he hath it by vertue of the purchaſe of Chriſt; Chriſt hath bought all good for us, and Chriſt hath bought us out of all evill. Chriſt hath not only pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt deliverance from hell, and ſalvation in heaven for us, but he hath purchaſt deliverance from a ſick bed, and freedome from bondage to men for us. (<hi>Zech.</hi> 9.11.) <hi>As for thee alſo</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>by the blood of thy Covenant</hi> (that is, the Covenant which I have made with thee) <hi>I have ſent forth thy priſoners out of the pit wherein was no water;</hi> that is, from the Babyloniſh cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. The Jewes were delivered from corporall ſlavery, as well as ſpirituall, by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo are the Covenant people of God to this day. The blood of the Covenant ſerves to all purpoſes; for the good things of this life, as well as of that which is to come. Nothing elſe can do us good to purpoſe, or deliver us from evill but the blood of Chriſt. (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 49.7, 8.) <hi>They that truſt in their wealth, &amp; boaſt themſelves in the multitude of their riches, none
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:104248:217"/> of them can by any meanes redeeme his brother, nor give to God a ranſome for him.</hi> In ſome caſes, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 13.8.) <hi>The ranſome of a mans life are his riches.</hi> As a mans riches doe often endanger his life (all the fault of ſome men for which they have ſuffered as deep as death, hath been only this, they were rich) ſo a man by his riches may redeeme his forfeited or endangered life, he may buy off the wrath of man, and ſo ranſome his life by his riches. But all the riches in the world cannot buy his life out of the hand of ſickneſs; though a man would lay out all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and ſpend all that he hath upon Phyſitians (as the poor woman in the Goſpel did) yet that could not doe it. We need the blood of Jeſus Chriſt to help us out of a ſick bed, and from temporall ſufferings as well as from hell and everlaſting ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And the more ſpirituall any are, the more they have recourſe to the blood of Chriſt for all they would have, whether it be freedome from this or that evill, or enjoyment of this or that good.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, Firſt, When we hear of a ranſome let us remember that we are all naturally captives. Here is a ranſome for our ſouls and a ranſome for our bodies, we are ranſomed from hell, and ranſomed from death, ſurely then, we are (through ſin) made captives to all theſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In that the ranſome is expreſt by a word, that notes hiding or covering, it ſhould mind us, that, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt by his blood</hi> (which is our ranſome) <hi>hath covered all our bloody ſins;</hi> and ſurely the blood of our ſins will appeare not only to our ſhame, but to our confuſion, unleſſe the blood of Chriſt cover them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We may hence infer, <hi>The Lord ſhall be no looſer by ſaving the worſt of ſinners.</hi> His Son hath taken care for that, he hath undertaken to ſee his Honour ſaved, and his Juſtice ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In all your outward afflictions and ſickneſſes; apply to the blood of Chriſt for healing, for helpe and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Being delivered from going down to the pit, from death by ſickneſs, <hi>bleſſe Chriſt for his blood.</hi> We are reſcued from the arreſt of death, from <hi>Deaths Sergeant,</hi> ſickneſſe, by the blood of Chriſt. And remember that as Chriſt ranſomes us from going

(<hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.14.) <hi>I will ranſome them from the power of the grave.</hi> Which though it were primarily meant of the deliverance of the Jewes out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> where they ſeemed to be not only dead but buryed; yet the Apoſtle applyeth it clearly to the ranſoming of the body dead indeed and laid in the grave, by the power of Chriſt at the generall reſurrection (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54.) <hi>For then ſhall be brought to paſſe that ſaying that is written, Death is ſwallowed up of victory. O death where is thy ſting? O grave where is thy Victory.</hi> Yea Chriſt hath ranſomed all thoſe from going down to the pit of hell, who take hold of his ranſome by believing. See that you have an intereſt in this ranſome, elſe you will never have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from going downe to that pit. We read not all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture over of any ranſome to deliver thoſe, who are once gone downe to that bottomleſſe pit. They that are in the grave ſhall be ranſomed and recovered by the power of Chriſt, but they that goe into hell ſhall never be ranſomed from thence. Take hold of this ranſome that ye may have full deliverance, both from ſickneſs leading to death here, and from hell which is the ſecond death hereafter.</p>

               <p>IN theſe two verſes <hi>Elihu</hi> proceeds, to ſhew the perfecting of the ſick mans recovery, the foundation of which was layd in the Lords graciouſneſs to him, ſpoken of in the former verſe; and the declaration of it in that word or warrant, which went out from God to the meſſenger about his deliverance <hi>from going downe to the pit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This mercy or recovery in, the full extent of it, hath a two-fold reſpect; Firſt, to his body; Secondly, to his ſoule.</p>
               <p>The mercy as it reſpects his body, is layd downe in the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. verſe; <hi>His fleſh ſhall be freſher then a childes; he ſhall returne as in the dayes of his youth.</hi>

               <p>The mercy which reſpects his ſoule, or the ſtate of his inward man, is layd downe in the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>He ſhall pray unto God, and be will be favourable unto him, and he ſhall ſee his face with joy; for he will render unto him his righteouſneſs.</hi>

               <p>In this recovery of his ſoule-ſtate, we may further conſider, Firſt, the cauſes of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Inſtrumentall cauſe, <hi>prayer; He ſhall pray unto God.</hi>
               </p>

                  <p>That is, he ſhall not barely recover his health, and get upon his leggs againe (as we ſay) he ſhall not meerely eſcape death and the grave, but he ſhall have an addition of bodily ability, he ſhall, as it were, be young againe.

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note; Firſt.</p>
                  <q>Bodily beauty, health and ſtrength are the Gift of God.</q>
                  <p>He gives them, and takes them away at pleaſure, or having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them away, he can give them backe when he pleaſeth. <hi>He kills and he makes alive, he bringeth downe to the Grave, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up,</hi> as <hi>Hannah</hi> ſayd in her Song (1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 2.6.) How low ſoever a man is brought by ſickneſs, either proper or metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, the Lord is able to rayſe him up againe. We read (<hi>v.</hi> 21.) in how pitifull a plight, the ſick man was, how rather like a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſe then a living man he lookt, <hi>His fleſh was conſumed, that it could not be ſeene, and his bones which were not ſeene, ſtood out;</hi> as much as to ſay, <hi>He was nothing but skin and bones;</hi> yet, when in that caſe all hopes were gone, and all natural helps fayled, it was no hard matter with God to cure him. When the skill of the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, and the vertue of medicines fayle, the power of God fayleth not. As it is in reference to thoſe outward dangers and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate exigents, which we meete with in this world by enemies and perſecutors, when we look upon our ſelves as dead men, when all hope of deliverance ſeems paſt &amp; gone, then the Lord alwayes can and often doth deliver. The Apoſtle gives us his experience of it (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 1.9, 10.) <hi>We had the ſentence of death in our ſelves;</hi> he ſpake not thus in regard of ſickneſs, but of trouble and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution; As if he had ſayd, The malice and wrath of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies was ſuch, that we thought we ſhould never eſcape, <hi>We had the ſentence of death in our ſelves,</hi> but providence ſuffered it to be ſo, that <hi>we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God who rayſeth the dead.</hi> As it is (I ſay) in ſuch dangers, ſo in dangerous deadly ſickneſſes; when a poore creature hath the ſentence of death in himſelfe, when he makes no other reckoning but to dye, as good King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſayd of himſelfe in his ſickneſs (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 38.13.) <hi>I
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:104248:220"/> reckoned till morning, that, as a Lyon, ſo will he breake all my bones, from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me;</hi> yet then as in his caſe, ſo in many caſes the Lord ſtretcheth forth a healing hand and takes the ſick man up againe, to continue in the land of the living.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the way of expreſſing this, in alluſion to a childe or a youth.</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>God he can quickly make the greateſt changes in nature, either for the better or for the worſe, He can turne youth into old age, and old age into youth.</q>
                  <p>That is, he can make a young or a healthy man weake as an old man, and an old or ſickly man ſtrong as a young man; and as it is with naturall, ſo with politicall bodyes, as with perſons, ſo with nations. A nation that is flouriſhing in its youth, heate, ſtrength and glory, rich and full of peace and plenty, God can bring an oldneſs upon it, and cauſe it to decline every day. The Prophet ſpake of the ſtate of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in this notion (<hi>Hoſ:</hi> 7.9.) <hi>Gray haires are here and there upon them, and they perceive it not;</hi> they thought ttemſelves to be in a very youthfull flouriſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (as a ſtate) but the Lord brought gray haires, that is, they were decaying, withering, weakning, and became a decrepid na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And when a nation is gray-hayred, old and withered, he can make it youthfull, he can recover the honour and power of it, and cauſe the dread of it to fall upon the neighbouring nations round about. He turnes a land into a wilderneſs, which before was as the Garden of God; And he can change that land into a Garden of God which now is a deſolate wildernes. The unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Lord is viſible and glorious in all theſe changes. The health and ſtrength both of the body politick and naturall are at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. He can bring a decay upon what is built, and repaire what is decayed, whether in nations or perſons. When the earthly houſe of this Tabernacle is ready to drop downe into the grave, and crumble into duſt, God by a word ſpeaking, repayreth it to as much beauty and ſtrength, as when, the firſt ſtone being layd, the top-ſtone was ſet up. When <hi>Naaman</hi> had once ſubmitted to and obeyed the Prophets counſell, which at firſt he deſpiſed, &amp; waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Jorden, His fleſh</hi> (ſaith the text, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.14.) <hi>came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:104248:220"/> like unto the fleſh of a little childe.</hi> The holy Pſalmiſt char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his owne ſoule <hi>to praiſe the Lord, and all that was within him to bleſſe his holy name</hi> (Pſal: 103.1, 5.) <hi>Who had ſatisfied his mouth with good things, ſo that his youth was renewed as the Eagle.</hi> This renovation of his youth may be underſtood three wayes; Firſt, as to his naturall ſtate, or bodyly ſtrength. Secondly, as to his civill ſtate or worldly ſucceſſes, as to his honour and kingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne. Thirdly, as to his ſpirituall ſtate, or the hightning of his gifts, graces, and comforts. 'Tis probable, <hi>David</hi> had found a declenſion in all theſe, and at laſt through the goodneſs of God and his bleſſing upon him, the renewing of them all from that old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to a youthfullneſs againe, like that of Eagles. We find the ſame alluſion in the Prophet (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 40.31.) <hi>They that wait upon the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength, they ſhall mount up as with Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles wings.</hi> Some Naturaliſts ſay, the Eagle reneweth her ſtrength by ſucking blood when her ſtomack is ſo weake that ſhee cannot ſeed upon the fleſh of her prey. Saints indeed renew their ſtrength as the Eagle, while by faith they ſucke the blood of Jeſus Chriſt; and they get cure of their owne weakneſſes, while they believingly lay hold upon his ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We heard in the former verſe of a divine warrant iſſued out for this mans recovery; <hi>Then he is gracious to him, and ſaith, deliver him.</hi> Here we have the warrant executed; <hi>His fleſh ſhall be freſher then a childes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>The commands and warrants of God are effectuall, they ſhall be obeyed and made good to man.</q>
                  <p>If God ſay, deliver him from a ſick bed, he ſhall be delivered; <hi>I will worke</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 43.13, 14.) <hi>and who ſhall let it? for your ſake I have ſent to Babylon, and have brought downe all their Nobles,</hi> or <hi>barrs,</hi> as the margin reads it; I will have it done, I will breake all thoſe Nobles who are as barrs in the way of my peoples deliverance. So when the Lord ſends his warrant for the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſick man, he will break all thoſe barrs and bands by which diſeaſes and ſickneſſes hold him as a priſoner in his bed. Nothing can ſtand againſt the word of God: as by a word ſpeaking he gave the creature a being, when it had none (The Lord only ſpake the word, <hi>Let there be light, let there be a firmament,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and it was
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:104248:221"/> ſo</hi>) Thus alſo the word or warrant of God reneweth a wel-being to thoſe, with whom it is worſt, or a comfortable life to thoſe, who are compaſſed about with the ſorrowes of death. The word of God prevailes over all, or is effectuall to every purpoſe (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 33.9.) <hi>He ſpake and it was done, he commanded and it ſtood faſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, In this reſtoring of the ſick, we have a ſhadow of the reſurrection. The rayſing of a dying man from his bed, is like the rayſing of the dead from the grave. The ſpring of the yeare is a ſhadow of the reſurrection, becauſe then the earth returnes to her youth, and is freſh as a child, In winter all things are dead and deſolate, their gloſſe and beauty is gone; but then cometh the ſpring and all revives againe, the face of the earth looks freſh, corne and graſſe, trees and plants flouriſh and put forth their buds and bloſſomes. Now, what the ſpring of the yeare is to the body of the earth, the ſame is the returne of health to the body of man; In both we have an exemplar of the reſurrection, as alſo in the regeneration or new birth of the ſoule, by the power of the holy Ghoſt. For till then we are, like old ſickly men, in the old man, yea we are dead. But no ſooner doth the Spirit bring us forth by a ſecond creation into the life of the new man, but we become in ſpirit freſh like Children, our youth returnes to us againe; that is, we returne to that ſtate wherein we were firſt created and ſet up by God in righteouſneſs and true holineſs; yea into a better and ſurer ſtate then that. Man through grace is not only as he was in the firſt day of his creation, but better; He returnes to the day of his youth, and receives ſuch a youth as ſhall never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay into old age; yea the older he is in nature, the younger, that is, the ſtronger and more beautifull he ſhall be in grace. <hi>He ſhall</hi> (according to that promiſe, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 92.14.) <hi>ſtill bring forth fruit in old age, he ſhall be fat and flouriſhing.</hi> This renewed youthfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and flouriſhing condition of the reſtored ſick man in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, is ſpecially and fully ſet forth in the next verſe.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Elihu</hi> having ſhewed the recovery of the ſick mans body, he proceeds to the recovery of his ſoule, which eminently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes to the dayes of its youth, both in the puttings forth of or exerciſing the grace of God received, and in receiving more grace, favour, and comfort from God, as will appeare in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words.</p>

The word is uſed againe concerning <hi>Manoah,</hi> after his wife had received a promiſe from the Lord of hearing a Son, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards called <hi>Sampſon</hi> (Judg: 13.8.) <hi>Then Manoah entreated the Lord, and ſayd. O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didſt
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:104248:222"/> ſend, come againe unto us,</hi> &amp;c. Fearing they might not fully fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the inſtructions given his wife for the education of their ſon, he earneſtly begged of the Lord further direction in that matter. That prophecy either of the Gentiles to be converted, or of the returne of the diſperſed Jewes, expreſſeth them by this word (<hi>Zeph:</hi> 3.10.) <hi>From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, my ſuppliants ſhall come, even the daughter of my diſperſed ſhall bring mine offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> As if the Prophet had ſayd; They ſhall ſpend themſelves in ſupplications at their returne, they ſhall come with ſtrong pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, with mighty prayers, as making prayer their buſineſs. They ſhall not come with frozen affections and cold requeſts, but with hearts flaming up in the ardency of their deſires, and urgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their ſupplications to the Lord. That's the force of the word; <hi>He ſhall pray;</hi> As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſayd, He ſhall not come with dead-hearted prayers and petitions, (as many doe in their ſickneſſes and ſorrowes) nor with a formal <hi>Lord have mercy upon me, and helpe me;</hi> but he ſhall make a buſineſs of it, he ſhall pray to purpoſe, he ſhall pray with his whole ſtrength. In which ſence the Lord bid <hi>Ananias</hi> goe to <hi>Saul,</hi> afterwards <hi>Paul</hi> (Acts 9.11.) <hi>For behold he prayeth;</hi> intimating that he had never prayed all his dayes before; nor indeed had he (though being brought up a ſtrict Phariſee, he was much in the forme of prayer) ever prayed in power before.</p>
                  <q>He ſhall pray.</q>
                  <p>Some underſtand this, <hi>He,</hi> relating to the meſſenger praying for the ſick man, <hi>He ſhall pray, and God will be favourable to him.</hi> That's a truth, 'tis the worke and duty of the meſſenger to pray for, as well as adviſe the ſick man. But I conceive rather the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon here intended praying, is the ſick man for himſelfe, who after he hath been counſelled, directed, and adviſed by the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger what to doe, applyeth himſelfe to the doing of it.</p>
                  <p>Further, Some, who agree that the ſick man is the perſon pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet underſtand it of prayer after his recovery; who finding himſelf healed and ſtrengthened prayeth unto God for grace, or for a right uſe of his health &amp; ſtrength. But I rather underſtand it of his prayer unto God in the time of his affliction; who when his ſins and tranſgreſſions have been laid before him by the meſſenger, and his ſoul-ſoars ſearched to the bottome, and faithfully dealt
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:104248:222"/> with, and ſo brought to a ſight of himſelfe, and of his ſin, with the ſad effects of it viſible upon this pained and conſumptive body, is then ſtirred to ſeek the Lord, and entreat his favour; <hi>He ſhall pray unto God;</hi>

                  <q>Sickneſſe is a prayer ſeaſon.</q>
                  <p>Prayer is a duty never out of ſeaſon, yet at ſome times more in ſeaſon, and moſt in ſeaſon in times of affliction; <hi>Is any man afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let him pray, (James</hi> 5.13.) And among all afflictions the affliction of ſickneſs ſeemes to be a ſpeciall ſeaſon calling for this duty. Therefore in the 14. verſe of the ſame Chapter, aſſoon as he had ſaid, <hi>is any man afflicted, let him pray,</hi> it followeth, <hi>is any ſick among you, let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him;</hi> 'Tis high time for us when ſick to look about us, to call in prayer-aide, or helpe from others in prayer; yet 'tis not enough fot the afflicted, or the ſick to get others to pray for them, they muſt pray for themſelves: ſome put off the duty of prayer to others, and think it ſufficeth if they ſend bills to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or move friends to pray for them. I know ſickneſs indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to prayer, bodily paine and weakneſs hinder continuance and abiding in the duty; but that doth not excuſe the ſick from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for themſelves. To deſire others to pray for us in bodyly ſickneſs, and neglect it our ſelves is an ill ſymptome of a ſick ſoul; yea to deſire others in that caſe to pray for us, when we have no heart to pray for our ſelves, is too cleare a prognoſtick that their prayers will not profit us, nor be prevailing for us. <hi>Pharoah,</hi> when under thoſe dreadfull plagues, could ſend for <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> more then once, and ſaid unto them, <hi>entreat the Lord for me,</hi> (Exod. 9.27, 28. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.16, 17.) But we read not that he entreated the Lord for himſelf. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> when ſtruck with the terrible threatnings of <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of theſe things which ye have ſpoken come upon me.</hi> (Acts 8.24.) But we read not that he prayed for himſelf. <hi>The prayers of others are rarely beneficiall to any, unleſſe they either pray or have a deſire to pray for themſelves. Elihu</hi> repreſents the ſick man pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for himſelf, <hi>he ſhall pray</hi>

                  <q>Prayer in ſickneſſe, and in all other caſes muſt be directed unto God, and to him only.</q>
                  <p>Divine addreſſes are fit for none but God; For Firſt, none are worthy of this honour but God; Prayer is ſo great a part of that honour and worſhip which is due to God, that it is often put for his whole worſhip. <hi>Mine houſe</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.7.) <hi>ſhall, be called an houſe of prayer for all Nations.</hi> Secondly, none can heare, that is, anſwer prayer but God; there is no help to be had but in him. As it is his glory to be prayed to, and ſuch a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as he will not part with to any other, ſo it is in vaine to pray to any other. <hi>In vaine is ſalvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of Mountains</hi> (that is, from the greateſt worldly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) <hi>truly in the Lord our God is the ſalvation of Iſrael, (Jerem.</hi> 3.23.) God only was <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Hills (Pſal.</hi> 121.1, 2.) <hi>I Lift my eyes to the hills from whence cometh my helpe;</hi> what theſe <hi>hills</hi> were, himſelfe explaines in the next verſe. <hi>My help cometh from the Lord who made heaven and earth; Baals</hi> Prieſts called upon <hi>Baal, they cryed Baal hear us,</hi> but ſaith the Text, <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>He ſhall pray, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>If we would have any mercy from God, we must ask it.</q>
                  <p>God is ready to give, but he looks to be intreated, and he will be intreated: What God hath promiſed to doe for us, his doing of it muſt be obtained by prayer. Working prayer, worketh the promiſes to their iſſue, yea prayer worketh the prophecies, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſalvation upon <hi>Sion,</hi> or ruine upon <hi>Babylon</hi> to their iſſue. Promiſes and propheſies are the expreſs will of God, and ſhall certainly be fullfilled in their ſeaſon; yet if we deſire their full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling, we muſt pray that he would fullfill them; and 'tis a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for good that God is about to fullfill them, when the hearts of his people are drawne out much in prayer for their fullfilling. There are ſome mercies, in the promiſes, rightly called prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:104248:223"/> mercies, they come upon us before we ask; ſuch is the mercy of out vocation, converſion or turning to God; we are naturally ſo far from praying while we are in the ſtate of nature, that we are continually blaſpheming or diſhonouring the name of God; but, as for perſons converted, (who are eminently called heires of the promiſe, that is, of the good in the promiſe) if they will have any good out of a promiſe, they muſt aske it. When the Prophet had declared many propheſies of good and great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things which God would doe for his people, he concludes with this direction from the Lord. (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.37.) <hi>I will yet for this be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael to doe it for them.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>I will not doe theſe things unasked,</hi> as you looke I ſhould doe theſe things for you, ſo I look you ſhould pray unto me that they may be done. A promiſe was made to <hi>Abraham (Gen.</hi> 22.17.) that his ſeed ſhould be multiplyed as the Stars of Heaven; now might not <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Son have ſaid, God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed me children, what need I pray for them? but <hi>Iſaac</hi> knew better, he knew that the promiſe was to be brought to the birth by prayer, therefore he entreated the Lord that he might have children.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, from theſe words <hi>He ſhall pray</hi> compared with the next, <hi>and he</hi> (that is God) <hi>will be favourable to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>The Lord is ready to hear when we pray, ready to give when we ask.</q>
                  <p>As prayer is honourable and delightfull to God, ſo fruitfull to man. <hi>Ask and it ſhall be given you, ſeek and you ſhall find</hi> (Math. 7.7.) <hi>He ſhall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him.</hi> Prayer ſhall not be loſt, nor vaniſh into aire. There was never any faithfull prayer loſt; though the prayers of many have not been anſwered in kind, that is, they have not had the very thing they asked for; yet they have had an anſwer to their prayers; and though prayer be not alwayes anſwered in our time, yet there is a time wherein all faithfull prayers ſhall be anſwered; one age reaps the fruit of thoſe prayers which another age hath ſowne. The ſeed time is one age, the harveſt in another. Latter Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions get good by the prayers of the former. Though we who pray ſee not the fruit of it, yet many ſhall find the fruit of it; and how
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:104248:224"/> often doth the fruit of prayer appear preſently, how often doth the anſwer come in upon the very putting up of the requeſt? (Iſa. 65.24.) <hi>Before they call,</hi> I <hi>will anſwer, and while as they are yet ſpeaking,</hi> I <hi>will hear.</hi> While the word is in their mouth, the mercy ſhall be put into their hand. While the Church (<hi>Acts</hi> 12.5.16.) was praying, <hi>Peter</hi> came in among them.

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> God is well pleaſed with, he is favourable to, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an humble ſinner.</q>
                  <p>When a ſinner is brought upon his knees and becomes a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant, when as he is laid low by affliction, ſo he lyeth low in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſupplication, then the Lord will be ſavourable to him, and ſhew his delight in him. The Lord delighteth not in the ſtrength of the horſe, he taketh not pleaſure in the legs of a man (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 147.10, 11.) No man is favoured by God, becauſe of his outward favour, becauſe he hath a beautifull face, or ſtrong cleane limbs; yea not only hath the Lord no pleaſure in any mans legs, but not in any mans braines, how reaching ſoever, nor in any mans wit how quick ſoever, nor in any mans judgment how deep ſoever, nor in any mans tongue how eloquent or well ſpoken ſoever, but the Lord <hi>taketh pleaſure in them that fear him, in thoſe that hope in his mercy; in thoſe that walk humbly with him, and call upon him. Let me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to his Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14.) <hi>hear thy voyce for it is ſweet;</hi> he meanes it not of an artificiall ſinging voyce, but of a ſpirituall praying voyce. That's the muſick which the Church makes for Chriſt. Nothing is ſo tunable nor takes the eare and heart of Chriſt, like the voyce of prayer and praiſe from a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart. All the beauties and rarities both of perſons and things are dull and flat, yea weariſome and loathſome to God in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of a gracious, honeſt, humble ſoul.

All godly men are Gods Favourites, he is favourable to them not only above many men in the world, but above all the men of this world, who have their portion in this life; And he therefore favours them; becauſe they are the purchaſe of his Son, and the workmanſhip of his Spirit, convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of, and humbling them for their ſins, as alſo creating them after God in righteouſneſs and true holineſs. <hi>Such ſhall be his favourites.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, Conſider the coherence or dependance of theſe words, <hi>He ſhall call unto God, and he will be favourable unto him.</hi> Whereas, before, all his complainings and outcryes ſtood him in no ſtead, now being humbled effectually, and taking hold of the righteouſneſs ſhewed and offered him by the Meſſenger of God, he no ſooner makes ſuit to God but is heard.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>God firſt ſhewes regard to the perſon, then to the offering, to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſervices.</q>
                  <p>This truth may be underſtood two wayes, Firſt, in reference to the ſtate of grace. When <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> brought their ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or offerings, <hi>God had reſpect to Abel and his offering,</hi> but to <hi>Cain and his offering had no reſpect,</hi> (Gen. 4.4, 5.) <hi>Abel</hi> was in a ſtate of grace, <hi>Cain</hi> was not, ſo the Apoſtle ſtates their caſe, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4.) <hi>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice then Cain, by which he obtained witneſſe that he</hi> (his perſon) <hi>was righteous, God teſtifying of his gifts;</hi> and what did he teſtifie? ſurely that his gifts were brought in faith, and were preſented from a principle of grace, which <hi>Cain</hi> had not; and therefore God did not approvingly teſtifie of his gifts. Till we cloſe with God by faith, God doth not cloſe with our ſervices by acceptance. Secondly, as this is true in reference to the ſtate of grace, ſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſomewhat in the preſent actings or diſpoſitions of thoſe who are gracious. 'Tis poſſible for a godly man to act ſo ſinfully, and to be ſo ill diſpoſed to the frame of his heart, that God may ſeem to deny acceptation to his prayers, and ſervices. <hi>David</hi> ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18.) <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not heare me.</hi> And God told the Jewes, his Covenant people, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15.) <hi>When ye make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.</hi> Thus while they who have a ſtate intereſt in Chriſt, walke unworthy of it, they are under the frownes of God, and his diſ-acceptation of all their duties, till they renew their repentance and humble themſelves. And I conceive this was the caſe of the ſick man in the Text (in whom doubtleſſe, he aimed at <hi>Job</hi>) whom <hi>Elihu</hi> granted to be a godly man, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great diſtempers of ſpirit, which muſt be healed &amp; removed before he could ſo call upon or pray unto God, as he would be favourable to him, or give him teſtimonie of his favour. Thus
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:104248:225"/> we ſee, in both theſe references, how the perſon of a man muſt be reſpected and in favour before his prayers can. For as we can have no benefit by the interceſſion of Chriſt, till we accept his perſon, ſo God will not give us any benefit by our ſupplications, till himſelf accepteth our perſons, which he doth only in Chriſt. Many would be ſaved by Chriſt, they would be pardoned and get to heaven, they would enjoy the benefits and priviledges which he hath purchaſed for his people, but they neglect Chriſt himſelf; nor doe they think of cloſing with his perſon. Now, I ſay, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we have reſpect to the perſon of Chriſt, and deſire union with him, we have nothing to doe with his benefits; ſo unleſs God hath reſpect to our perſons, we get no benefit, no anſwer of our prayers.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>To have the favour of God, or to be accepted with him, is the top and ſumme of all deſireable favours.</q>
                  <p>'Tis the Alpha and Omega, the firſt and laſt of all other favours, to find God favourable to us; if God be favourable to us, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not much who frowns upon us, or what foul weather we meet with in this world. And, as to be in his favour ſhould be the chief of all our deſires, ſo to be aſſured of his favour ſhould be the chief of all our ſtudies and cares (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.) <hi>Herein</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we labour, that whether preſent or abſent we may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him.</hi> The word notes to labour ambitiouſly; as if he had ſaid, we labour as much for the favour of God, as ever any of the ſons of ambition laboured for the favour of Princes, or regard with the Kings of this world. No man ever plotted or flatter'd and crouched ſo much to the Kings of the earth for favour, as we doe to God for favour; <hi>herein we labour.</hi> We make it our buſineſs to be accepted with him; if God once accept a man, you may turne him looſe, he will ſhift for one. How compleately happy the condition of ſuch a favourite is, will appeare yet furtber in opening the next clauſe of this verſe.</p>
                  <q>And he ſhall ſee his face with joy.</q>
                  <p>When once God is favourable to a poor ſinner, then he ſhall be <hi>uſed or dealt with like a favourite.</hi> Great Favourites ſtand in the preſence of Princes, and frequently ſee their faces. Whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:104248:226"/> any man favours he freely admits to his preſence, and takes delight in his company. Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks of Gods Favourite, <hi>He ſhall ſee his face with joy.</hi>
                  </p>

God will look cheerfully and ſmilingly upon the face of this poor ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant; God will look upon him, as we doe upon friends whom we favour and have much reſpect for. Friends may ſee content and joy ſhining in or ſtampt upon our faces, when we look them in the face. The content which we take in ſeeing the face of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is viſible in the ſmiles and joyes of our own faces. As when we look ſowrely, angryly, ſorrowfully, ſullenly upon a man, when darkneſs is ſeen in our faces, and clouds gather in our brows, ready to diſſolve into a ſtorme, this ſpeaks we beare him no good will, or rather that we bear him much diſpleaſure. So when we looke pleaſantly upon a man, doth it not ſay, that we are highly pleaſed with him? To be ſure, when God is at peace with a repenting ſinner, he no longer frownes upon him, nor turns his face from him as an enemy, but entertaines and welcomes him as a friend; which is directly oppoſite to <hi>Jobs</hi> apprehenſion of God at the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of this Chapter, <hi>Behold he findeth occaſions againſt me, he counteth me for his enemy.</hi> This is a ſweet ſoul-reviving and raviſhing truth. God beholds the face of his people with joy, he beholds them ſmileingly, cheerfully, delightfully. <hi>David</hi> calls it <hi>The light of Gods countenance</hi> (Pſal. 4.6.)</p>

He mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth himſelf in love to others, and all ſuch are ſaid either (as in the Text) to ſee his face, or (as other Texts expreſs it) to have his face ſhining upon them. God is a ſpirit, he hath no face properly; but as the face of a man is that, by which he is knowne (if a man hide his face we know not who he is, though we ſee all the other parts of his body, he is a concealed man) ſo that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is, by which God is clearly knowne, that in Scripture lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is called his face. And hence Thirdly, the worſhip and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordinances of God, are called the face of God (<hi>Gen.</hi> 4.14.) becauſe they are great manifeſtations of God, or becauſe God is manifeſted in his Ordinances, in his word and worſhip, who and what he is, After a ſick man, through the help of God, is recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; he goes into the congregation to give thanks; and then he may be ſaid to ſee the face of God, becauſe there be exhibits the ſigns of his preſence, &amp; doth as it were ſhew his face.

Jeſus Chriſt is the face of God, <hi>the brightneſſe of his glory, the expreſſe image of his perſon, (Heb.</hi> 1.3.) <hi>The light of the knowledge of the glory of God ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to us in the face of Chriſt.</hi> Thus the face of God is beheld in
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:104248:227"/> the face of Chriſt. There we may ſee how holy, how juſt, how good, and mercifull God is; all this glory of God appeareth to us in the face of Chriſt, who is the higheſt manifeſtation of God. Here in the Text by the face of God; we are to underſtand any demonſtration of Gods favourable preſence; in which ſence of the word, <hi>Aaron</hi> was to bleſſe the children of <hi>Iſrael (Numb.</hi> 6.25.) <hi>The Lord make his face to ſhine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up the light of his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.</hi> That is, the Lord manifeſt himſelf to thee in wayes of grace and peace, in favour and in mercy. <hi>David</hi> prayed in the ſame ſtile (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 67.1.) <hi>God be mercifull to us, and bleſs us, and cauſe his face to ſhine upon us;</hi> that is, give us tokens and pledges of his favour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>How ſee we the face of God?</hi> Doth not God tell <hi>Moſes, No man can ſee my face and live.</hi> How then can the face of God be ſeene?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; The face of God (which was touched before) as taken for the eſſence of God, or for his eſſentiall glory, cannot be ſeene; That's too tranſcendent a glory for man to behold. What we ſee of God is but ſome ray or beaming out of light and glory from himſelfe, we cannot ſee himſelfe. The eſſentiall or perſonall glory of God, is that face which cannot be ſeene, but the declarative glory of God is a face of God which may be clearely ſeene by faith in the light of his word and workes. And to ſee the face of God, is nothing elſe but for a man to <hi>know in himſelfe</hi> (as the Apoſtles word is in ſomewhat a parallel caſe, <hi>Heb:</hi> 10.34.) that God is gracious to him, that is, to have an aſſurance of his favour, or a reflect act of faith about it. The holy Spirit ſheweth us what God is, and what the things of God are (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2.12.) <hi>We have received not the ſpirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things that are freely given to us of God;</hi> that is, that we may<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Spirit ſheweth us this bleſſed face of God, and we ſee it by the actings of our faith; all our viſions of God in this life are viſions of faith; upon whoſe wings all our intellectuall powers ſoare aloft and are carried up to God. Faith is not only a worke of the will in conſent and application, but a worke of the underſtanding by aſſent and knowledge. Thus we
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:104248:227"/> ſee God (as a Spirit is only to be ſeene) with a ſpirituall eye. The viſion of God is intellectuall, the viſion of faith.<note place="margin">Videre faciem dei, nihil aliud eſt quam ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re apud ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum ſuum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um propitium. <hi>Coc: In Jubilo.</hi> i. e. in quodam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicabili gaudio. <hi>Aquin:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The word ſignifies joyfull acclamation, or ſhouting for joy, ſuch as men uſe after great favours done them and benefits or rather bounties beſtowed upon them. There is a ſeeing of the face of God with terror; ſo the wicked ſhall ſee God, that is, they ſhall have manifeſtations of Gods diſpleaſure; they ſhall be made to ſee him with ſhame and ſorrow: They ſhall ſay (when they ſee him) to the <hi>mountaines and rockes, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lambe.</hi> They who never ſaw the face of God with joy, ſhall ſee it with horror &amp; amazement. Saints ſee it with joy, they have unexpreſſible comfort and contentment in beholding God; they ſhall rejoyce with ſhouting, as in the yeare of <hi>Jubile,</hi> when they ſounded out their joyes with trumpets, or made a joyfull noyſe. 'Tis no ordinary but a triumphant joy, with which the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee the face of God. Extraordinary ſights affect with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary joy. Now the face of God being the higheſt and moſt glorious ſight in the world, it muſt needs affect the beholder with a glorious with a <hi>Jubilean joy. He ſhall ſee his face with joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, It being ſayd, <hi>He ſhall ſee his face with joy,</hi> upon his prayer, and the humbling of himſelfe before God.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>God hides or vayles his face, till we humble our ſoules and ſeeke his face.</q>
                  <p>God will not be ſeene at all times, no not by his owne people; There are ſeverall caſes in which he turneth away his face in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or drawes a curtaine (as it were) yea a cloud between him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and the ſoule. And this he doth, Firſt, and moſt uſually to try his people, how they can beare his withdrawings, and to ſee whether or to what they will betake themſelves, when he takes himſelfe ſo much from them, that they cannot ſee him. Secondly, He doth it often to chaſten and correct man for ſin.
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:104248:228"/> To be under the hidings of Gods face, is the ſaddeſt effect of ſin to a ſencible or an awakened ſoule. <hi>David</hi> made a grievous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint becauſe of this, what ever the cauſe or occaſion of it was. (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 13.1.) The abſence of God from him (though poſſibly but for a ſhort time) was ſo tedious to him, that he cryed out, <hi>How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?</hi> Even Jeſus Chriſt while he ſtood in the place of ſinners, bare the hiding of his fathers face, as the ſumme of all thoſe puniſhments which were due to and deſerved by our ſin. This preſſed him more then all bodyly ſufferings, and made him cry out, while he hung upon the Croſſe, <hi>My God, my God</hi> (not why haſt thou left me to be crucified, but) <hi>why haſt thou forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me</hi> (Math: 27.46.) Thirdly, God hideth his face from ſome, becauſe the manifeſtations of it have not been received thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor improved rightly. We ought to give thankes for the light of the Sun ſhining in the ayre, and alſo doe our worke in it; Is it any wonder if God cloud and eclipſe the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance towards thoſe, who neither prize it, nor improve it? If you would alwayes ſee the face of God, then be ye alwayes ſeene at the worke and in the wayes of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>It is the ſole priviledge of Gods Favourites, or of thoſe to whom he is favourable, to ſee his face.</q>
                  <p>As no man can ſee that face of God, his eſſentiall preſence, ſo none but Godly men ſhall ſee this face of God, his comfortable or bleſſed-making preſence. <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord</hi> (Heb: 12.14.) There is a two-fold viſion or ſight of God, and that negative aſſertion may be underſtood of either or of both. There's firſt, a viſion of God on earth; thus we ſee his face, as was ſhewed before, in the actings of faith; For though the Apoſtle oppoſeth theſe two, faith and ſight; <hi>We walke by faith, and not by ſight</hi> (2 Cor: 5.7.) yet faith hath its ſight; we walke not by ſight as the worldly men walk, who doe as they ſee, and make their eyes both the guide of their conſciences, and the in-bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their comforts; we walke not by outward ſight, nor doe we make concluſions how to guide our converſations, by what we ſee. We walke by faith, and that's the ſight which we have of God while we are here on earth, which cannot poſſibly be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:104248:228"/> holineſs; faith being ſo great a part of our holineſs, and (by drawing vertue from Chriſt dayly) the maintainer of it all. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, there is a ſight of the face of God in glory. And if none can enter into glory but holy men, then no man without holineſs can ſee the face of God there. Thus Chriſt ſaith of the Angells, <hi>They alwayes behold the face of my father which is in heaven (Math:</hi> 18.10.) Now we ſee the face of God darkly as in a glaſſe (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 13.12.) that is, in his word and workes, in his ordinances and appoyntments; in theſe we have glimpſes of the face of God, but <hi>we ſhall ſee him face to face;</hi> that is, as fully and comprehenſively as creatures can; we can never comprehend God, but we ſhall have comprehenſions of God ſo farre, as finite can take in the fruitions of Infinite. <hi>We ſhall ſee his face with joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>It is the greateſt joy and happineſs of man imaginable to ſee the face of God.</q>
                  <p>Any manifeſtation of God is a joyfull favour, and a full mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of him fills the heart with joy; <hi>Lord lift up the light of thy countenance upon us</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal: 4.6, 7.) <hi>thou haſt put gladneſs in my heart more then in the time their corne and wine increaſed;</hi> As if he had ſayd, I rejoyce in thy favour more then worldlings doe in their beſt enjoyments. <hi>Shew us the father and it ſufficeth us,</hi> ſayd <hi>Philip</hi> (John 14.8.) let us have but that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and we deſire no more; we have enough, we can have no more, if we may <hi>but ſee the father.</hi> True joy ſtands not in any ſights, nor in the ſight of any thing here below, but in the ſight of God above while we are below, and in a hope that we ſhall at laſt get above too, and there have an everlaſting ſight of him, <hi>in whoſe preſence is fullneſs of joy, and at whoſe right hand are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for evermore.</hi> We read in the Leviticall Law, <hi>of the ſhew-bread,</hi> which was to be ſet in the holy place, upon a Table (<hi>Exod:</hi> 25.30.) The Hebrew is, <hi>the bread of faces.</hi> There are two reaſons of this denomination; Firſt, Becauſe that Bread did ſhew the gracious proviſion that God made for them all the way they journeyed from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> or that he ſpread a Table for them in the wilderneſs where they had no harveſt; To which the Prophet may allude (<hi>Jer:</hi> 2.2.) <hi>I remember</hi> (ſaith the Lord)
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:104248:229"/> 
                     <hi>the kindneſs of thy youth, the love of thy eſpouſalls, when thou wenteſt after me in a land that was not ſowne;</hi> that is, when thou didſt truſt me for thy dayly bread. Secondly, It was called the <hi>ſhew-bread,</hi> to teſtifie the ſpeciall preſence of God with them, and that his eye was alwayes upon them, ready to do them good upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. This was the high priviledge of the Jewes then, they had the <hi>bread of faces;</hi> and this is the joy of the people of God now, that what ever good they have, it is the face of God to them; their bread is the <hi>bread of faces,</hi> and their wine is the wine of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, they are a ſignification of the favour and love of God to them, or they look upon the love and favour of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in thoſe things, much more then upon the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Now if it be ſo great a mercy to have ſome manifeſtation of the face or favour of God, or that we are alwayes in the ſight and view of God; What will it be to us when we ſhall alwayes abide in the preſence of God, and ſee his face with joy?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Note.</p>
                  <q>A juſtified perſon hath confidence to looke up to and thinke of God; He doth it with joy; and that's the fruit of a well-grounded confidence.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 3.17.) <hi>there is liberty,</hi> a liberty of addreſſe and approach to God, a liberty alſo of ſpeech and prayer to God. True godlineſs hath much well regulated boldneſs with God; and as a Godly man ought with reverence, ſo he can with a wel-grounded confidence looke God in the face.</p>
                  <q>For he will render unto man his righteouſneſs.</q>
                  <p>This latter part of the verſe giveth an account of the ground of that joy which the ſick man found in ſeeing the face of God. <hi>He ſhall ſee his face with joy</hi> (ſaith <hi>Elihu) for he</hi> (that is, God) <hi>ſhall render unto man his righteouſneſs.</hi>

Secondly, to return or turn from that diſpleaſure which was once conceived. When the Lord, is, as it were, in a hot purſuit of ſinners, he returns or turns from his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The Prophet ſpeakes in the negative (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 5.25.) <hi>For all
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:104248:229"/> this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill,</hi> or he is not returned from his anger. Thirdly, The word is uſed to note mans return unto God by repentance (<hi>Deut:</hi> 30.28.) We by ſin turn away from God, and by repentance we return to him. Fourthly, It ſignifieth to returne by way of requitall (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 116.12.) <hi>What ſhall I render unto the Lord</hi> (It is this word) or, <hi>What ſhall I return to the Lord for all his benefits? David</hi> was in an holy muſe or maze, what teſtimony of thankfulneſs he ſhould bring to the Lord. <hi>What ſhall I render?</hi> And in that ſence it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed both to God and man; ſometimes in relation to evill done, and then it notes to render puniſhment or revenge (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 28.4.) <hi>Render to them their deſert,</hi> ſo the word is uſed by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> brethren (<hi>Gen:</hi> 50.15.) <hi>He will certainly requite us all the evill which we did unto him;</hi> they were jealous of their brothers love when their father was dead. And as it notes a return of evill done in way of revenge, ſo alſo a return of good done in way of reward, thus here.</p>
                  <q>He will render unto man.</q>
                  <p>It is an indefinite aſſertion, not to this or that man, but to man. <hi>With God there is no reſpect of perſons, but he that worketh righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> (let him be who he will) <hi>is accepted of him.</hi> To man, that is, to every man God will render
<q>his righteouſneſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Righteouſneſs is of two ſorts; Firſt, There is the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our ſanctification, which conſiſts; Firſt, in our turning from or leaving to doe evill; Secondly, in our doing good: this is a righteouſneſs wrought by us and dwelling or inherent in us. The Hebrewes by this word often expreſſe that which we call <hi>almes or charity;</hi> and the reaſon is two-fold, why almes or acts of charity are expreſſed by that word which ſignifieth righteouſneſs; Firſt, becauſe our charity or our almes muſt be given of thoſe things that are rightly gotten. We muſt not doe unjuſtly that we may be charitable, nor wrong ſome to relieve others. Secondly, becauſe charity and almes is a due or right to the poor that are in want; we call it charity, but it is a work of duty (<hi>Prov:</hi> 3.27.) therefore 'tis well expreſſed by <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi> He ſhall render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man <hi>his righteouſneſs</hi> or <hi>beneficence.</hi> We may take it in this
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:104248:230"/> large ſence; for this alſo is a part of our ſanctification. And when it is ſayd, he will render unto man <hi>his righteouſneſs,</hi> we are not to underſtand it of righteouſneſs in kinde, but of the reward or fruit of his righteouſneſs. For here <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks of a perſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready righteous, or at leaſt of him who had repented of and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from his unrighteouſneſs. So that, to <hi>returne</hi> or render unto man <hi>his righteouſneſs,</hi> is to returne the mercy promiſed to thoſe that are righteous.<note place="margin">Reddet juſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am. <hi>i. e.</hi> prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium juſtitiae. <hi>Druſ:</hi>
                     </note> For as iniquity or unrighteouſneſs is often put for the puniſhment of unrighteouſneſs; ſo equity or righteouſneſs is often put for the reward of righteouſneſs, or for that which God according to his righteous promiſe returnes unto a righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Thus we may underſtand <hi>Elihu</hi> here. As if he had ſayd, <hi>God dealt with this man before, as with a ſinner, or he afflicted him for his ſin; But now he will deale kindly with him as with a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon, and removing his affliction, and taking his hand off from him, he will render his righteouſneſs to him, he will not reckon with him for any former unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this notion of the word, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>God uſually deals with men as they are, and according to what they doe.</q>
                  <p>If a godly man ſin he ſhall ſmart for it; and if a ſinner return and repent, God will ſhew him kindneſs. Though the mercy and kindneſs which God ſhews to a returning ſinner, be not for his returnings or repentings, yet 'tis according to them. The favour which God ſheweth any man is for Chriſts ſake, or for what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered, but it is according to what himſelfe hath done or ſuffered. <hi>David</hi> experienced this himſelfe (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 18.20.) <hi>The Lord rewarded me according to my righteouſnes,</hi> &amp;c. That is, as I have been a righteous and juſt perſon, ſo the Lord hath dealt with me. And he gives the rule with reſpect to all others (<hi>v.</hi> 25.) <hi>With the upright thou wilt ſhew thy ſelfe upright, with the pure thou wilt ſhew thy ſelfe pure,</hi> &amp;c. That is, Thou wilt be ſuch to men in thy diſpenſations, as they are in their converſations and diſpoſitions, in the frame and bent of their hearts and lives. And as it followeth (<hi>v.</hi> 27.) <hi>Thou wilt ſave the afflicted</hi> (or humble) <hi>people; but wilt bring downe high lookes;</hi> that is, thoſe that are proud and high-minded. The Prophet holds out the ſame truth in way of direction (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 3.10.) <hi>Say ye to the righteous, it ſhall
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:104248:230"/> be well with him, for they ſhall eat of the fruit of their doings;</hi> that is, they ſhall have good for the good they have done, or according to the good which they have done. (<hi>Rom:</hi> 2.10.) <hi>Glory, honour, and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Gentile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any object; But may it not be ill with men that doe good and are good? doth the Lord alwayes render to man according to his righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; It is well at preſent with moſt that doe well; look over all the ſons of men, and generally ye ſhall find that uſually the better they are, the better they live.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer; It ſhall be well with all that doe well in the iſſue, and for ever. This truth will abide to eternity; <hi>God will render unto man according to his righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may take the word <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Juſtiam, quam ei confert in Chriſto, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans eum pro juſto. <hi>Jun:</hi>
                     </note> for the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of juſtification; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Broughton</hi> inclines to that ſence, <hi>He will reſtore unto man his juſtice.</hi> And preſently adds by way of gloſſe; <hi>Juſtice is Christ;</hi> It is Chriſts Juſtice or righteouſneſs that is reſtored to man. Chriſt is indeed <hi>The Lord our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> (Jer: 23.6.) And thus ſeverall others of the learned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound theſe words. <hi>He will render unto man his righteouſneſs;</hi> That is, he will beſtow upon him or reſtore to him righteouſneſs in Chriſt; he will account him righteous, though he hath no righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of his owne which will hold in Gods account. <hi>Elihu,</hi> I grant, calleth it <hi>Mans righteouſneſs, his righteouſneſs;</hi> yet we may well underſtand him calling it ſo, not becauſe it is wrought by but becauſe it is imputed to or beſtowed upon man as his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. <hi>That is ours which is freely given us,</hi> ſo is righteouſneſs in juſtification by faith in Chriſt. We have no righteouſneſs wrought in us or by us, for that purpoſe; but we have a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs wrought for us, and freely beſtowed upon us, for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which is therefore truely called <hi>mans righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome may queſtion, how can it be ſayd, that God doth render or return to man this righteouſneſs, that is, the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of juſtification? Can this righteouſneſs be loſt? can a perſon juſtified fall out of a juſtified ſtate?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; The righteouſneſs of juſtification (which is true al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the righteouſneſs of ſanctification) as to the ſubſtance and being of it cannot be loſt; But it may be loſt as to the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:104248:231"/> enjoyments and fruits of it, or as to our apprehenſion of it; And the Lord is ſayd to returne to man the righteouſneſs of his juſtification, not as if the grace it ſelfe were loſt or taken away from him, but becauſe the ſight and ſence of it, the ſweetneſs and joy of it,<note place="margin">Non enim abla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta juſtitia red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur ſed abla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae juſtitiae ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. <hi>Coc:</hi>
                     </note> the workings and effects of it having been loſt, are now reſtored to him againe. When the Lord by his Spirit gives the ſoule a cleare and freſh evidence of it, or reneweth the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Spirit with our ſpirits, that our ſins are forgiven, and that we are juſtified, beloved, and accepted in Chriſt, then the Lord is ſayd to render unto man his righteouſneſs; otherwiſe, neither the faith, by which this righteouſneſs is applyed, nor the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs it ſelfe which is applyed to us by faith, is at any time loſt or removed. Only in this ſence, as in many other Scriptures, ſo in this, the Lord is ſayd to render unto man his righteouſneſs, both of ſanctification and juſtification. For, when a beleever through ſin hath blotted his own evidences, and God hath left him under the darkneſs of his own ſpirit, for his negligent, unwatchfull &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy walking, or when the Lord hideth his face, to try him what he will doe, whether <hi>he will truſt in his name while he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in darkneſs and ſeeth no light,</hi> when, I ſay, after withdrawings for either of theſe reaſons or for any other the Lord gives him in a renewed evidence of his love, then he is ſayd to <hi>render unto man his righteouſneſs.</hi> It is in this caſe as with a man that labours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome ſtrong and dangerous diſeaſe, which taketh away his ſences, and leaves him halfe dead; we ſay, the man is gone, yet he recovers, his ſpeech returnes, and his ſpirits revive, and then we ſay, <hi>his life is rendred to him,</hi> or he is brought back from the grave, we have fetched him againe; not that his life was quite taken away (for he was not a carkaſſe in that condition, a body without a ſoule) but his life was, for that time, withdrawne, there was no appearance of it, no ſencible breathing, no motion, no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall viſible operation. Thus we may conceive what is meant by the rendring unto man <hi>his righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> A juſtified perſon is a righteous perſon.</q>
                  <p>He hath a clothing of righteouſneſs; that which we call <hi>his righteouſneſs,</hi> is not properly but imputedly his. It is not a cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his owne making, but made for him and beſtowed freely
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:104248:231"/> upon him. (<hi>Rom:</hi> 10.3.) <hi>They being ignorant of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God; and going about to establiſh their owne righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted themſelves to the righteouſneſs of God.</hi> It is Gods righteouſneſs not our owne, and yet it is our owne as well as the righteouſneſs of God, it being imputed and reckoned unto us for our righteouſneſs; it is the believers righteouſneſs as given to him, it is Chriſts righteouſneſs as wrought by him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>A juſtified perſon under great afflictions and temptations often looſeth the comfortable ſight and ſence of his owne righteouſneſs.</q>
                  <p>And ſo may look upon himſelfe as an unrighteous perſon, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no righteouſnes, or as being unreconciled &amp; unjuſtified. For, as many bold ſinners &amp; hypocrites preſume they have a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs when they have none, and boaſt themſelves to be in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the juſtified when they are not. So many an afflicted and tempted ſoule, who is indeed juſtified in the ſight of God, may be unjuſtified in his owne. Great afflictions have an appearance of divine diſpleaſure, which ſtands moſt oppoſite to juſtification. As affliction is a kinde of darkneſs, ſo it often leaves the ſoule in much darkneſs. And he that is in the dark is full of feare, he is apt to queſtion his ſtate, whether he hath any thing of God in him or no. For though it be not good for a Chriſtian alwayes to begin to live, he ſhould come to a poynt, and labour for a certainty; yet ſome are brought to ſuch a paſs that their former evidences and experiences are even dead and lye proſtrate, and they conſtrained to begin a new reckoning about their ſpirituall eſtate, or, as it were, to begin againe to live.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>Mans righteouſneſs or juſtification, is as loſt to him when he wants the evidence, that is, the comfort, ſweetneſs, and peace of it.</q>
                  <p>When his ſoul-ſtate is ſo ravel'd and intangled, that he can make nothing of it, then his righteouſneſs is as loſt. <hi>Thoſe things which appeare not, are to us as if they were not. Not to know what we have, is a degree of not having.</hi> When grace doth not act or is not uſed, we are ſayd in Scripture to lack grace, or to have none. (2 <hi>Pet:</hi> 1.9.) <hi>But he that lacketh theſe things is blind, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:104248:232"/> ſee afar off.</hi> The whole context carrieth it of believers, who are in a ſtate of grace, who yet not uſing grace are ſayd to lack it, and are called blinde, as not able to ſee afar off, how it was with them when the work of converſion firſt began, &amp; ſo have upon the matter forgotten that they were ever purged from their old ſins. That is, they act as a man that hath never had any acquaintance with God, or knew ſo much as the meaning <hi>of repentance from dead workes.</hi> He, in the Goſpel, who had but one talent and did not uſe it, is ſayd to have none, <hi>From him that hath not ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away even that he hath</hi> (Math: 25.29.) 'Tis a ſtrange ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to ſay, that ſhall be taken away from a man which he hath not; yet the idle ſervant is ſayd not to have that one talent which he had, becauſe he did not uſe it, but layd it by as a dead ſtocke. Now, as in reference unto the grace of ſanctification in us, when we doe not act, we are ſayd to lack it, or not to have it, ſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the peace of juſtification, when we have not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of it, we are ſayd to be without it. And therefore when peace is reſtored to the ſoule, righteouſneſs or juſtification is reſtored alſo.</p>
                  <p>Further, from the connexion of theſe words, <hi>He ſhall ſee his face with joy; for he will render unto man his righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, Fourthly.</p>
                  <q>When the ſight of our righteouſneſs or juſtified ſtate in Chriſt returnes to us, our comforts returne.</q>
                  <p>We may be juſtified or in a juſtified ſtate, and not rejoyce. But if we know we are in a ſtate of juſtification, we cannot but rejoyce. It will make a man rejoyce to purpoſe, when he ſeeth the righteouſneſs of juſtification is clearely his (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 45.25.) <hi>Surely ſhall one ſay in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength: One ſhall ſay this:</hi> He ſhall not only have righteouſneſs in the Lord, but he ſhall ſay he hath; that is, he ſhall be able to make it out; he ſhall have the light of it upon his ſpirit, and then as it followeth in the Prophet; <hi>In him ſhall all the ſeed of Iſrael be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and ſhall glory.</hi> When they are able to ſay this, then they ſhall not only rejoyce but glory. Glorying is the height of joy, or joy is in its full ſtrength. The Apoſtle ſaith (<hi>Rom:</hi> 14.17.) <hi>The kingdome of God is not meat and drink</hi> (What is it then?) <hi>but righteouſneſs</hi> (and what elſe?) <hi>peace and joy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                     <pb n="443" facs="tcp:104248:232"/> Righteouſneſs brings in peace, that's the firſt fruit; The warre is ended, the controverſie determined between God and the ſoule, and when once peace is entred, joy will follow. It is uſuall to make triumphs, when, a formerly broken, peace is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two nations. When <hi>Abimilech</hi> ſent commiſſioners to make a covenant of peace with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the holy Story ſaith (<hi>Gen:</hi> 26.30.) <hi>He made them a feaſt, and they did eate and drinke.</hi> Surely when God ſends his holy Spirit to ſpeake peace to a troubled ſoule (againſt <hi>whom his terrors have been ſet in array</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> ſayd in his own caſe, <hi>Chap:</hi> 6.4.) <hi>and the arrowes of the Almighty within him have drunke up his ſpirit</hi>) he (I ſay) having his peace thus reſtored to him, cannot but have the joy of the Lord reſtored to him, as <hi>David</hi> prayed his might (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 51.12.) <hi>Reſtore unto me the joy of thy ſalvation;</hi> That is, ſhew me that I am juſtified, that my ſin is pardoned; this will bring back into my boſome the joy of thy ſalvation, and my drooping ſoul ſhall be not only refreſhed but feaſted as with marrow and fatneſs. Joy is a certaine conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon the ſight of our juſtification; Yea joy is not only a conſequent, but a fruit and effect of it; joy floweth out of the nature of it; nor is it ever interrupted or ſuſpended, but upon the hiding of righteouſneſs out of our ſight. And therefore joy returnes unfayleably when the Lord is pleaſed thus <hi>to render unto man his righteouſneſs.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It muſt be granted, that to look upon or behold man, is in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a deſcriptive periphraſis or circumlocution, expreſſing a man recovered from ſome dangerous &amp; deadly ſickneſs. And therefore when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> thought his ſickneſs was to death, and his caſe deſperate; He thus bemoaned himſelfe (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 38.11.) <hi>I ſhall not ſee the Lord, even the Lord in the land of the living; I ſhall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.</hi> But, ſaith <hi>Elihu,</hi> the ſick man being perfectly recovered, talkes with and looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men; And the firſt diſcourſe he iſſueth, is a confeſſion of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for his iniquity; <hi>I have ſinned, I have perverted that which was right, and it profiteth not:</hi> And his next is a confeſſion of praiſe for his recovery; <hi>He hath delivered,</hi> or I am aſſured <hi>he will deliver my ſoule from going downe to the pit, and my life ſhall ſee the light.</hi> This is a profitable expoſition; and much inſiſted upon by ſome very learned interpreters, and therefore I ſhall make a little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it by this briefe obſervation.</p>
                  <q>It is our duty, being recovered from ſickneſs, to confeſs and make knowne the goodneſs of God and our ſinfulneſs to thoſe that are about us.</q>
                  <p>There is a three-fold confeſſion; Firſt of faith, that we believe what God hath revealed and promiſed to doe for us. Secondly, of prayſe, that we thankfully acknowledge what God hath done for us according to his promiſe. Thirdly, of repentance, that we are heartily ſorrowfull for and bewayle, what we have done againſt the command of God. We ſhould be aſhamed to ſin before men, but let us not be aſhamed to confeſſe our ſinfullneſs, and (in ſome caſes) our ſpeciall ſins before men. Though we neither impoſe nor extort particular confeſſions from men (as the Papiſts doe) yet it is good for men who have been under the afflicting hand of God, and have had great experience of his mercy in raiſing them
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:104248:234"/> up, to declare what God hath done both for ſoule and body, that others may be bettered by their experiences.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall not ſtay upon this, becauſe our tranſlation (which is cleare and ſafe) runs another way, making the antecedent to this <hi>he,</hi> to be God; <hi>He,</hi> that is, God <hi>looketh upon men, and ſaith, If any ſay, I have ſinned, and have perverted that which is right, and it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited me not,</hi> Then (as it followeth) <hi>He will deliver him from going downe to the pit, and his life ſhall ſee the light.</hi> The ſence of the context in Generall, is plaine; <hi>God looketh upon men, and if he ſeeth them penitent, he will have mercy upon them, and deliver them, or give them that which is better then bodily deliverance.</hi> More diſtinctly.</p>
                  <q>He looketh upon men.</q>
                  <p>It is the work of God at all times to look upon men; and he looketh ſo upon all men, as if he had but one man to look upon. His look upon men is not a bare look, but a conſidering, and an obſerving look. He ſo looks upon men, that he looks through them. He looks upon them, and takes notice what they are, how it is with them, what they are doing, and at what they are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. He looks upon them to conſider both the frame of their hearts, and the courſe of their lives; yea his looking is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting: he ſo looketh upon man, as looking for ſomewhat from man, or as deſiring to ſee ſomewhat in him. Though God hath no need of us, nor of any thing we can doe, yet he looketh, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or hath an expectation, of ſomewhat to be done by us. He looketh upon ſick men, to ſee how they take it; with what patience they beare affliction, what the workings of their hearts are, what their repentings, what the actings of their faith; ſuch things as theſe the Lord looketh for from moſt men, moſtly from men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rod, under ſad &amp; ſorrowfull diſpenſations. And the words following ſhew what it is expreſſely which the Lord looketh for. Yet before I open them, note in generall.</p>
                  <q>God loves to ſee occaſion of doing good to man.</q>
                  <p>What we love to doe, we love the opportunities of doing it. The Lord is good, and he loveth to doe good, and therefore he is expreſſed as one troubled when he wants, &amp; as one pleaſed when he hath the occaſions of doing it. We may take up that ſence emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:104248:234"/> from that moſt patheticall wiſh (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 81.13, 14, 15, 16.) <hi>O that my people had hearkned unto me, and Iſrael had walked in my wayes, I ſhould ſoone have ſubdued their enemies, and turned my hand againſt their adverſaries. The haters of the Lord, ſhould have ſubmitted themſelves, but their time ſhould have endured for ever: I ſhould have fed them alſo with the fineſt of the wheate,</hi> &amp;c. As if the Lord had ſayd, How glad ſhould I have been if my people had been but fitly qualified to give me occaſion of removing all evill from them, and of doing them all manner of good. The holy Prophet ſpeakes the heart of God in the ſame readineſs (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 30.18.) <hi>Therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious unto you, therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you.</hi> As if he had ſayd, The Lord expects your reformation, that he may not proceed in rigour againſt you, or as ſome conceive ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he only delayeth his putting an end to your troubles, till ye are humbled, expecting a ſeaſonable time to ſhew you that mercy, in beſtowing of which he will exalt and advance his owne name and honour, when once he ſeeth you fitted and duely prepared to receive it. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal: 14.2.) <hi>looked downe from heaven upon all the children of men, to ſee if there were any did underſtand and ſeek God.</hi> There he is repreſented looking downe from heaven to ſee if any did underſtand, as here, <hi>he looketh upon men</hi> to ſee if any doe repent, <hi>ſaying, I have ſinned,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord often, yea alwayes looketh downe upon Nations, Cities and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to ſee if any have a right underſtanding of him, or a will with upright affections to him. The Lord at this day is looking upon the ſick, and looking upon the ſound, to ſee if there are any, who are going on faithfully in a right way, or repenting that they have gone wrong. <hi>He looketh upon men; And if any ſay,</hi>
                     <q>I have ſinned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this latter part of the verſe, we have the matter expreſſed which the Lord looketh upon men for, 'tis repentance and godly ſorrow for ſin; <hi>If any ſay, I have ſinned;</hi> That is, if any repent. When the Lord ſaith, <hi>If any ſay, I have ſinned,</hi> he doth not meane it of a bare ſaying ſo, but, if any ſay ſo, laying his ſin to heart; if any ſay ſo from a true ſence of the evill of ſin; if any ſay ſo bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd with ſin, and taſting the bitterneſs of it; if any ſhall ſay, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> and ſay it thus, then <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The word which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Sin muſt be confeſſed. The Lord looks for it. He looketh upon men to ſee whether any will ſay, I have ſinned.</q>
                  <p>He will have their ſin out of their own mouths. When <hi>Nathan</hi> brought the parable home to <hi>David</hi> and ſayd, <hi>Thou art the man,</hi> he preſently fell into confeſſion, <hi>I have ſinned</hi> (2 Sam: 12.13.)</p>

                  <p>I anſwer; Firſt, a generall confeſſion of ſin, or that we have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned is not ſufficient, unleſſe we are alſo willing and ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe before the Lord all our particular ſins.

                     </note> they are great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who know not how or in what they have ſinned, not what it is to ſin. Therefore barely to ſay, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> is not a Goſpel confeſſion of ſin. I anſwer. Secondly, Though a generall confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is only expreſſed in this and many other Scriptures, yet a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall confeſſion is intended. The prodigal Son (<hi>Luke</hi> 15.19.) ſayd, <hi>I will returne to my father, and I will ſay to my father, I have ſinned againſt heaven, and againſt thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son.</hi> He did not enumerate the particular evill acts he had committed and was guilty of, yet doubtleſſe he had them as a burden upon his heart, and was willing to unburden himſelfe of them, one by one, in a hearty and heart-afflicting confeſſion. The publican (<hi>Luke</hi> 18.13.) <hi>ſtood a far off, and durst not lift up his eyes to heaven, but only ſayd, God be mercifull to me a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> He ſtruck at all his ſins, though he did not by name touch any one of them. He that ſaith (knowing what he ſaith) <hi>I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> will not hide any one of his ſins; And he that indeed and truth confeſſeth any one, will cover none of his ſins. Thoſe ſins may be pardoned which are not expreſſely confeſſed, but if we
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:104248:236"/> conceale or hide any ſin, and will not bring it forth in confeſſion, we cannot, in faith, expect the pardon of it.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Conſider the time or ſeaſon when the Lord looked for this confeſſion; It was a time of trouble and affliction, of paine and ſorrow, the man was ſick, or but in a way of recovery out of his ſickneſs.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>Times of affliction are ſpeciall times of confeſſion and repentance.</q>
                  <p>Confeſſion of ſin muſt not be omitted (eſpecially not neglected) in our moſt comfortable dayes, much leſſe in a day of trouble. A ſad and troubled ſtate calls us aloud to a gracious ſadneſs of heart, to the ſearch of our hearts and lives, which are preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to repentance and Godly ſorrow. Uſually in proſperity men will not be at leiſure to ſearch their hearts, and take notice of their ſins. Therefore the Lord draweth them to confeſſion by drawing them from the world, by laying them upon their ſick beds, or by bringing them into ſtraites. And as when affliction is upon perſons or families, then is a ſpeciall time to confeſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall and family ſins; ſo to confeſſe national ſins, is moſt ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when affliction hath ſeized upon kingdomes and nations. The want and neglect of that publicke confeſſion and ſorrow in ſuch a day is mightily aggravated, and moſt ſeverely threatned (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 22.12, 13, 14.) God looketh and loveth to heare every man, ſaying, and a whole nation, as one man, ſaying in a day of ſorrow and trouble, <hi>I have ſinned, and perverted that which was right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the latter words, <hi>I have perverted that which was right,</hi> or <hi>the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, Firſt.</p>
                  <q>The law of God is the rule of righteouſneſs; a right rule.</q>
                  <p>All rightneſs and righteouſneſs is comprehended in it, <hi>and meaſured by it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Learne.</p>
                  <q>Sin is a perverting of that which is right.</q>
                  <p>Every (the leaſt) ſin is ſo in ſome degree, though here, poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, ſins are intended of any, even of the higheſt degree. The
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:104248:236"/> Apoſtle defining ſin, calleth it (1 <hi>John</hi> 3.4.) <hi>A tranſgreſſion of the Law;</hi> and if ſo, it muſt needs be a perverting of that which is right: For what is or can be right, if the rule of righteouſneſs be not. What the Apoſtle ſpake to <hi>Elymas</hi> (Acts 13.10.) <hi>Wilt thou not ceaſe to pervert the right wayes of the Lord,</hi> ſhewes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and effect of every ſin, and the more ſinfull any ſin is, by ſo much the more doth it pervert that which is right. Some ſinners are ſayd to make voyd the law of God, to pervert it, as if they would quite ſubvert and diſanull it. <hi>David</hi> remembers God of ſuch, and deſires him to look to them betimes (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 119.126.) <hi>It is time for thee to work, for they have made voyd thy law;</hi> That is, they have done their beſt, or worſt rather, their utmoſt to make it voyd, and of no force; 'Tis not in the power of all the powers of the world, to vacat reſcind or null one tittle of the law of God, heaven and earth ſhall paſſe away before that, yet many attempt it, yea ſome doe that which will be found and interpreted a mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voyd of the law of God, who thinke themſelves great zelotes for, or very zealous of the law. That will be the caſe of many, eſpecially, of all will-worſhippers.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Conſider though the perſon here ſpoken of had not only ſinned, but perverted that which was right, that is, ſinned perverſly, yet upon confeſſion the Lord deales graciouſly with him.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>The free grace of God extends to the pardon of the greateſt ſins, even ſins of perverſneſs.</q>
                  <p>Where ſin aboundeth, Grace aboundeth much more (<hi>Rom:</hi> 5.20.) whether the abounding of ſin be taken in the number of it, or in the weight of it, that is, in the greatneſs and aggravations of it, Grace hath its ſutable ſuper-abounding (<hi>Num:</hi> 23.21.) When <hi>Balaam</hi> would ſhew that the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were a people im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable by his curſes, he ſaith, <hi>The Lord hath ſeen no iniquity in Jacob, nor perverſneſs in Iſrael.</hi>

They who have ſinned perverſly, or who have perverſneſs mingled with their ſin, ſhould not caſt off the hope of pardon, but woe to thoſe who ſin perverſly, (that is, againſt the light of their owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences) upon hopes of pardon. Such perſons have no true hope (they may have much preſumption) that they ſhall be pardoned. They who having ſinned perverſly, confeſſe it, have good ground to pray for pardon, but they who goe on ſinning perverſly, have no ground (while they doe ſo) to hope for it. This text ſpeakes of a perſon confeſſing and bewayling that he hath ſinned perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not of a perſon purpoſing to ſin ſo, as appeares further in the laſt clauſe of the verſe; <hi>If any ſay, I have ſinned and perverted that which is right.</hi>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The puniſhment of ſin in this life is not equall to ſin.</q>
                  <p>As all the ſufferings of this life are not worthy to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the glory of the next life (<hi>Rom:</hi> 1.18.) ſo neither are they comparable with the ſins of this life. When a man is under

It was no little puniſhment which that people endured, yet they confeſſed it was leſſe then their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.

                  <p>As a godly man doth not thinke any ſin little, ſo he doth not thinke any affliction great compared with his ſin. <hi>Cain</hi> ſayd, <hi>My puniſhment is greater then I can beare;</hi> but he did not ſay, it was greater then his ſin. How hot ſoever the furnace of divine wrath is heated, yet ſinners muſt acknowledge there is ſparing mercy in it; and that God might have made it ſeven times hotter, and therefore hath afflicted them leſs then their ſin. As a godly man is ready to acknowledge his mercy more then he hath deſerved (<hi>Gen:</hi> 32.10.) <hi>I</hi> (ſayd <hi>Jacob) am not worthy of the leaſt of all the mercies, and all the truth which thou hast ſhewed unto thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> as if he had ſayd; I am leſs in my good actings then any of thy actings towards me for good have been) ſo he is ready to ſay, his greateſt afflictions or evills which he ſuffereth are leſs then his ſins, or then the evills which he hath done.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Sin pretends profit and advantage to a ſinner.</q>
                  <p>There is no temptation comes without a bait. Though ſome ſin purely for ſins ſake; yet it is rare that ſin cometh without the offer of a bribe, and profit is one of the greateſt both baits and bribes that the Devill puts upon the hook of temptation, when he fiſheth for ſoules. <hi>You ſhall get by it,</hi> ſaith that deceiver. But the repenting ſoule, can truly ſay, <hi>it profited me not;</hi> I had thought to have gotten by my ſin, it promiſed me very faire, but I have got nothing but blows. The temptation with which the Devill aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our firſt parents was of this kinde, He told the woman of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, ſhe and her husband ſhould gaine knowledge by it, (that's a noble gaine) <hi>They ſhould be as Gods knowing good and evill,</hi> there's all profit imaginable in ſuch a knowledge. Chriſt himſelfe who was God and perfectly knew good and evill, was alſo tempted with profit (<hi>Math:</hi> 4.8, 9.) <hi>The devill ſhewed him all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the world</hi> (and thoſe not with bare walls, but ready hung and furniſhed) <hi>and the glory of them, and ſayd unto him, all theſe things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall downe and worſhip me.</hi> If our head and the heire of all things was tempted with profit, how much more poor we! No marvaile if Satan provide him Agents to ſay to us as they are repreſented (<hi>Pro:</hi> 1.13.) <hi>Come, caſt in your lot among us, we will all have one purſe,</hi> or a joynt ſtock in this wicked trade; What they hoped to get by it, is told us in the next words; <hi>We ſhall find all precious ſubſtance, and fill our houſes with ſpoyle.</hi> We ſhall get enough, and you ſhall ſhare with us if you will but come and goe with us. We ſee what ſin promiſeth; But what doth the ſinner find? himſelfe anſwers, <hi>It profited me not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:104248:238"/>
                  <p>Hence learne.</p>
                  <q>There is nothing gotten by ſin, no good is gotten by it.</q>
                  <p>The Apoſtle puts the queſtion to ſinners (<hi>Rom:</hi> 6.21.) <hi>What fruit had ye then, in thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> Caſt up your account, and tell us what you find at the foot of it. Poſſibly ſome may ſay, we have gotten hundreds and thouſands, we have gotten houſes and lands, our barnes are full of corne, our fields of cattel, and our bags are full of treaſure. But is it profit to have houſe and land, gold and ſilver come in by ſin? Let that Scripture anſwer (<hi>Math:</hi> 16.26.) <hi>What is a man profited if he ſhall gaine the whole world and looſe his own ſoule?</hi> But ſome may ſay, they that are in Chriſt cannot looſe their ſoules by ſin. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; Firſt, though they that are in Chriſt cannot be ſuch ſinfull ſoules, as to ſin away their ſoules, though they cannot ſin at ſuch a rate, nor in ſuch a height as to looſe their ſoules who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed found Chriſt, or rather who are found of him, and planted in him; yet the dammage which every ſin unrepented of and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned puts man to is the loſſe of his ſoule. Secondly, ſuppoſe a ſinner repenteth, what hath he got by ſin, but the ſorrows of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And though no man ſhall have cauſe to repent of true repentance for ſin, yet no man ſhall have cauſe to boaſt of the penny-worth he hath had by ſin which hath occaſion'd the ſorrows of that repentance. One houres communion with God in wayes of holineſs is better then all the profits and pleaſures which any man hath got while he was committing that ſin, or running any courſe of ſin, whereof he now repenteth. At the beſt ſin diſhonours God, troubles our conſciences, and breakes our peace; at the beſt nothing is got by ſin which is worth the having, at worſt the ſoule is loſt by it, which of all things we have is moſt worth the having.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>Sin is exceeding dangerous and deſtructive to man.</q>
                  <p>Some would ſin for the pleaſures and carnal contentments which are found in ſin, though they knew they ſhould make no earnings, or get no profit by it, yea though they knew they ſhould be and dye beggers by it. Once more, if this were all, that they ſhould looſe heaven by it, or if the meaning of looſing their ſoules
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:104248:239"/> were only this, that their ſoules ſhould be no more, they would eaſily venture it. But there is an affirmative in the negative, and when, 'tis ſayd, <hi>ſin profiteth not,</hi> the meaning is, it brings trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and renders us miſerable for ever; <hi>Fooles</hi> (that is, all ſinfull men, ſaith the Spirit of God, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 107.17.) <hi>becauſe of their tranſgreſſion, and becauſe of their iniquities are afflicted;</hi> and all ſuch among theſe fooles, as dye in their ſin are damned; and who is able to ſumme up the dammage of damnation?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Learne.</p>
                  <q>Sinners ſhall be forced at laſt to confeſſe that there is no profit in ſin.</q>
                  <p>True penitents confeſſe it willingly now; and impenitents ſhall confeſſe it at laſt, whether they will or no; they ſhall have ſuch a conviction of the evill of ſin by their ſufferings, as will make them ſay, what hath pride profited me? and what hath envy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited me? what hath malice and wrath profited me? And what hath the fraudulent deceiving of my neighbour profited me? this will be the cry of ſinners to all eternity. Oh what hath ſin profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us? That which is the willing confeſſion of a gracious repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant here, will be the forced confeſſion of damned impenitents for ever hereafter. This will be a bitter repentance. Hell is and will be full of the words of repentance, but no fruit of repentance ſhall be found there. The damned ſhall not find either amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in themſelves, or mercy from God. This will be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of all ſinners at laſt (as of thoſe that repent and are ſaved, ſo of thoſe who repent when damned) we have ſinned and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted that which was right, and it hath not profited us. And when once man hath made this hearty confeſſion to God of his ſin and folly, then God maketh him a gracious promiſe of deliverance and mercy, as appeares in the tenour of the next verſe.</p>

                  <q>He will deliver his ſoule from going into the pit.</q>
                  <p>The words are an aſſertion of the favour and goodneſſe of God to the penitent ſick man; <hi>He</hi> (that is, God) <hi>looketh upon men, and if he heare any ſaying, I have ſinned and perverted that which is right, and it profiteth me not,</hi> if he make ſuch an humble and gracious confeſſion, this will be the iſſue; the Lord <hi>will deliver his ſoule from going into the pit.</hi> At the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, we had words of the ſame import; <hi>He keepeth back his ſoule from the pit, and his life from periſhing by the ſword.</hi> And againe, at the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him from going downe to the pit.</hi> To be delivered from the pit (as was there ſhewed) is to be delivered from death.

                  <q>And his life ſhall ſee the light.<note place="margin">Videre lucem periphraſis eſt vitae; ſicut è contrario tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae ſunt ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum mortis. <hi>Pined:</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>That is, he ſhall live to ſee the light; <hi>To ſee the light,</hi> is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocution of life; As if it had been ſayd, He ſhall recover out of his deadly ſickneſs, and behold the light of the Sun, as living
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:104248:240"/> men doe. Thus <hi>David</hi> prayed (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 56.13.) <hi>That he might walke before God in the light of the living.</hi> And thus the wicked man is threatned with eternall death (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 49.19.) <hi>He ſhall goe to the generation of his fathers, they ſhall never ſee light;</hi> That is, they ſhall never enjoy life, but be ſhut up in a perpetuall night of death, or in the night of perpetuall death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When 'tis ſayd, <hi>his life ſhall ſee the light,</hi> we may underſtand it, not only for a bare returne to life, or that he ſhall live, but that he ſhall live comfortably and proſperouſly, he ſhall lead a happy life. <hi>To ſee the light,</hi> is to live and rejoyce; light is pleaſant, it is comfortable to behold the Sun, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes. To ſee light, comprehends all the comforts of this life, and of that to come, which is called, <hi>the inheritance of the Saints in light, (Col:</hi> 1.12.) For as darkneſs is put not only for death, but for all the troubles of this life, and the torments of the next; ſo light is put both for life, and for all the comforts of this and the next life. All the bleſſings of this temporall life, and the perfect bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of eternall life, are comprehended in light. So that when 'tis ſayd, <hi>his life ſhall ſee the light,</hi> the ſence riſeth thus high; <hi>He ſhall be happy forever;</hi> ſo extenſive is the favour of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting perſons, that time is too narrow for it; everlaſting light ſhall be their portion. From the former branch of the words thus opened, <hi>He will deliver him from the pit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>All our deliverances are of God.</q>
                  <p>As there is none can deliver like God, ſo none can deliver but God. If he gives out the word that ſuch a man ſhall goe to the pit, it is not in the power and skill of all the Princes and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians in the world, to ſave or ſtay him from it. And how low and deſperate ſoever any mans condition is, if God ſay the word, he is deliver'd and reprieved from going downe into the pit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the connexion with the former verſe, the ſick man having made this confeſſion, <hi>I have ſinned and perverted that which is right, and it profiteth me not,</hi> the Lord preſently delivers him, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>God is ready to deliver, humble praying and believing ſinners.</q>
                  <pb n="459" facs="tcp:104248:240"/>
                  <p>That command hath a promiſe joyned to it (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 50.15.) <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver.</hi> The 107<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Pſalme ſpeakes this quite through, where we find many ſorts of periſhing perſons, crying unto God, and God delivering them from periſhing when they cryed. As when ſin cryeth God will afflict, ſo when ſinners cry, God will relieve them in or bring them out of their affliction.</p>
                  <p>From the latter branch, <hi>His life ſhall ſee the light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>Naturall life, and light are a great bleſſing.</q>
                  <p>God promiſeth much when he promiſeth life and light; The light of this life is no ſmall mercy, how much greater is the light of ſpirituall life? But who can conceive how great a mercy the light of eternall life is! yet all this God ſpeakes to the humble and believing ſinner, when he ſaith, <hi>His life ſhall ſee the light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Comparing the two parts of this text together, <hi>He will deliver him from going downe to the pit, and his life ſhall ſee the light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>The mercy of God to humble ſinners, is a compleate mercy.</q>
                  <p>Here is not only deliverance from evill, but the beſtowing of good; it is much to be kept from going downe into the pit, but it is more to ſee light, the light of comfort here, and the light of glory hereafter. The mercy of God to his people is great in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralls, greater in ſpiritualls, greateſt in eternalls. The benefit of redemption (to ſhew the fullneſs of it) is ſet forth two wayes; Firſt, by our freedome from evill; Secondly, by our enjoyment of good. (<hi>John</hi> 3.16.) <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life. He ſhall not periſh</hi> (that is, he ſhall be delivered from going downe to the pit) <hi>he ſhall have everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life;</hi> that is (as the text ſpeakes) <hi>his life ſhall ſee the light.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>In theſe two verſes, we may take notice, chiefly of two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The frequency of Gods dealing thus with man (<hi>v.</hi> 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Lo all theſe things worketh God oftentimes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The deſigne and purpoſe of God in doing ſo; <hi>That he may bring back his ſoule from the pit, and be enlightned with the light of the living.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Lo, all this worketh God oftentimes with man.</q>
                  <p>Here's the application of the former Doctrine; <hi>Elihu</hi> preſſeth his hearers with it, and bids them lay it to heart; As if he had ſayd, <hi>I have not been ſpeaking of things in the clouds, but of what is really and dayly acted among the children of men. Lo</hi> (or behold) <hi>all theſe things.</hi> There are foure ſpeciall ſignifications in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this word, <hi>Lo,</hi> or <hi>behold,</hi> and they may all foure meete in this place.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It imports ſome new unheard-of and wonderfull thing (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 7.14.) <hi>Lo, or behold a virgin ſhall conceive, and bear a ſon:</hi> That a virgin ſhould bring forth a ſon, is a wonder of wonders, a wonder ſo much above the courſe and power of Nature, ſo much beyond the compaſſe &amp; comprehenſion of reaſon, that men and Angels have reaſon to be aſtoniſhed at it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, 'Tis prefixed, to ſhew ſome extraordinary impulſe or readineſſe of ſpirit for action. Thus Chriſt ſpeaketh in that
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:104248:241"/> other noble prophecy of him (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 40.7.) <hi>Then ſaid I, Lo, I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me; I delight to doe thy will O my God: yea thy Law is within my heart. Lo, I come,</hi> that is, I am ready to come, I am preſt upon the work, I am under the preſſure and command of my own ſpirit, as well as under thy appoyntment and decree to undertake and finiſh that worke of mans redemption.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It frequently implyeth matter worthy of weight and deepeſt conſideration. That's uſefull and remarkeable which is thus prefaced. Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaking of the field of the ſlothfull man, ſaith (<hi>Prov:</hi> 24.31.) <hi>Lo, it was all growne over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the ſtone wall thereof was broken downe:</hi> As if he had ſayd, Marke, this is a thing to be attended, the ſluggards field is full of thorns; that is, in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſence, <hi>ſlothfull hearts are full of lusts and vanities.</hi> In this language the Church invites all to conſider the Glorious excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of God (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 29.9.) <hi>Lo, this is our God.</hi> And thus Chriſt ſpeakes of the woman whom he had healed on the Sabbath day (<hi>Luke</hi> 13.16.) <hi>And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, theſe eighteene yeares, be looſed from her infirmity on the Sabbath day?</hi> As if he had ſayd, Pray conſider the caſe and ſpeake your mindes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, 'Tis often uſed in a way of ſtrong aſſertion, and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, intimating the certainty of what is ſpoken (<hi>Gen:</hi> 1.29.) <hi>And God ſaid, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing ſeed.</hi> And againe (<hi>Gen:</hi> 12.11.) <hi>It came to paſſe, when he was come neere to enter into Egypt, that he ſaid unto Sarah his wife, Behold, now, I know that thou art a faire woman to look upon.</hi> (Read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.6. <hi>Ezek:</hi> 30.9. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.32.)</p>
                  <p>In the preſent text it may have all theſe intendments; for is it not a wonderfull thing, that God ſhould be gracious to poore creatures? is it not ſtrange that he ſhould take ſo much paines with, and exerciſe ſo much patience towards them? Secondly, <hi>Lo, God worketh all theſe things;</hi> He is ready to doe them, he waiteth to be gracious, or to magnifie his grace in doing them. Thirdly, <hi>Lo, God worketh all theſe things;</hi> is not this a matter of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, ought we not to ſit downe and weigh it well? Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Lo, all theſe things worketh God;</hi> certainly God hath and will work all theſe things; this is a truth out of all queſtion, a truth of
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:104248:242"/> which there is no doubt to be made. As the Apoſtle ſaith (1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3.16.) <hi>Without controverſie, great is the myſtery of Godlineſs, God was manifeſt in the fleſh;</hi> So I may ſay without controverſie, great is this myſtery of Gods manifeſting himſelfe to frayle fleſh, and doing all theſe things here ſpoken of, awakening the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men by dreames, and working upon them by grievous ſickneſſes, ſending an interpreter one of a thouſand to declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man his uprightneſs, and at laſt delivering his ſoule from going downe into the pit. <hi>Lo, all theſe things worketh God.</hi>

The ſpeech is diſtributive. For though we are not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it ſo largely, as if God dealt thus with every particular man, yet he deales thus with many men, even with as many as himſelfe pleaſeth, or hath purpoſed. <hi>Lo, All theſe things worketh God oftentimes with man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>Such is the goodneſs of God, that though man is not wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſently, or at the firſt, yet he will come a ſecond or a third
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:104248:244"/> time to carry his worke through with him.</q>
                  <p>'Tis a mercy that God will ſpeake once, or uſe any means once with us, 'tis mercy that he will ſpeake any one word in any one way, to bring us off from ſin; 'tis mercy that he will ſend one viſion, or one affliction, to awaken us out of our ſecurity, or one meſſenger to inſtruct us once in our duty; but when the Lord is pleaſed to uſe ſeverall meanes, and thoſe ſeverall meanes, ſeverall times, how doth the aboundant mercy and graciouſneſs of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in this! And as the mercy of God in generall, ſo the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God in ſpeciall appeareth aboundantly in it. The Lord waites to be gracious, he waites the working of this or that means, of a ſecond and third meanes, and he waites the working of them all over againe and againe, or oftentimes; here is patience with long-ſufferance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>God will perfect his worke, and bring it to an iſſue with ſinfull man.</q>
                  <p>God would not give over working to humble <hi>Job,</hi> till he had fully humbled him; And this made <hi>Job</hi> almoſt amazed at Gods dealing with him (<hi>Chap:</hi> 7.17, 18, 19.) <hi>What is man that thou ſhouldeſt magnifie him? and that thou ſhouldeſt ſet thy heart upon him? And that thou ſhouldeſt viſit him every morning, and try him every moment. Job</hi> ſeemed much troubled at this inſtancy of God with him, and therefore expoſtulated in the next words, <hi>How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I ſwallow downe my ſpittle?</hi> But, for all his crying, God would not depart from him, nor let him alone for a morning, no nor for a moment till he had finiſhed his worke and accompliſhed his will both in him and upon him; till he had brought his heart into a due frame and temper under his mighty hand. If once or twice will not doe it, he will doe it thrice; The Lord is not weary either of working or waiting; <hi>God is a rocke</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> Deut: 32.4.) <hi>and his worke is perfect;</hi> and of all his workes, that of grace is moſt perfect. His viſible providentiall works are perfect or ſhall be before he hath done with them, or put his laſt hand to them, but his inviſible ſpirituall workes are moſt perfect; as God worketh often to bring man out of the ſtate of ſin to grace; ſo he will not ceaſe working till grace be perfected, he will worke till that worke is wrought
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:104248:244"/> to the height, till the top-ſtone of it is ſet up, or as the Apoſtle phraſeth it (<hi>Eph:</hi> 4.13.) <hi>Till we all come to a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fullneſs of Chriſt.</hi> Though a man hath been once truly humbled, yet God humbles him againe, that he may be humbled gradually as well as truly to his own mind. They that are humbled by affliction, may need more afflictions to humble them. The ſame meanes by which faith and repentance are wrought at firſt, doe alſo encreaſe and ſtrengthen faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Thoſe meanes by which a man is at firſt purged, are very proper for his further purging (<hi>John</hi> 15.2.) <hi>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</hi> As no man can be a true branch (hypocrites and formaliſts are bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches only in appearance and profeſſion, they were never truly purged, now, I ſay, as no man can be a true branch) till he is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſo God purgeth thoſe who are true fruit-bearing branches more and more, that they may bring forth more fruit. And the means by which he purgeth them, that is, mortifieth their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſeldome reach this bleſſed effect at once or twice working, and therefore the Lord is even conſtrained to worke theſe things twice, thrice, or oftentimes, elſe the worke would not be brought to the intended iſſue.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In that it is ſayd, <hi>All theſe things worketh God often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, not alwayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Man ſhould make hast to anſwer the call of God, and come up to what he requireth of him.</q>
                  <p>For though God worke theſe things oftentimes, yet no man knowes how often he will worke, and we may all know, he will not worke alwayes. 'Tis a high and dangerous preſumption to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre at any time upon hopes that God will work at another time, becauſe in ſome caſes he workes oftentimes. Remember (as was ſhewed before in opening the words) this thrice is the leaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of often, as twice is the leaſt number of any; two or three are the leaſt number that makes a Church-aſſembly (<hi>Math:</hi> 18.20.) The Prophet ſaith (<hi>Amos</hi> 2.4.) <hi>For three tranſgreſſions of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, and for four, I will not turne away the puniſhment thereof.</hi> Implying that if men multiply their tranſgreſſions, God will not
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:104248:245"/> alwayes give them meanes of repentance, but powre out wrath upon them; So <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, God worketh <hi>twice and thrice;</hi> but if men will ſin three or foure times, where is their warrant that God will pardon or paſſe by their ſins? The Prophet did not binde up the mercy of God preciſely to two or three tranſgreſſions,<note place="margin">Rabbi Solom: colligit tertan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum homini ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcere deum; at quarto ſi ad peccandum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dierit eſſe quod ſibi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>à gehenna timeat; et id eſſe putat quod hoc loco ab Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu dicatur.</note> but if men ſin without bounds, he ſhewes they have no ground to expect God ſhould be mercifull. One of the Jewiſh Rabbins (as ſome expound him) concludes peremptorily, If man ſin twice or thrice God will ſpare, but if foure times God will puniſh. We doe not circumſcribe the grace of God to a ſpeciall number, and poſſibly that Rabbin did not intend it ſo, but only that all ſhould take heed they doe not abuſe the grace of God. That God multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to pardon, or (as we render, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 55.7.) <hi>Pardoneth aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,</hi> is no ſecurity for any man to ſin aboundantly, or to multiply tranſgreſſions. <hi>My ſpirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with man</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Gen:</hi> 6.3.) I have ſtriven long already, and I will yet ſtrive longer, even an hundred and twenty yeares, but I will not ſtrive alwayes. God gave <hi>Jezebel</hi> a ſpace to repent (<hi>Rev:</hi> 2.21.) but when ſhe repented not, he did not promiſe her a new ſpace to repent in, but threatned her with wrath to the utmoſt if ſhe repented not. There is a frequency in the worke of God to reduce ſinners, but not a perpetuity. And as in this verſe <hi>Elihu</hi> reports this frequency of his worke, ſo in the next he reports that to be the deſigne of it,
<q>
                        <bibl>
                           <hi>Verſ. 30.</hi>
                        </bibl> To bring back his ſoule from the pit, to be enlightned with the light of the living.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This verſe (I ſay) ſheweth the purpoſe of God in working <hi>twice, thrice, or oftentimes with man.</hi> This purpoſe (as was tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before) is two-fold. Firſt, to free and deliver him from evill, the worſt of evills, a horrible <hi>pit.</hi> Secondly, to eſtate him in and give him poſſeſſion of not only that which is good, but beſt of all, <hi>the light of the living.</hi> Not is this purpoſe of God a bare deſire (that's often fruitleſs and ſucceſsleſs) but a ſtrong or ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led reſolution, <hi>to bring back the ſick mans ſoule from the pit.</hi> And <hi>Elihu</hi> (we may ſuppoſe) ſpake thus, as to preſſe <hi>Job</hi> to haſten the worke of his repentance; ſo to put him in hope (upon conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of this deſigne of God in afflicting him) that he ſhould
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:104248:245"/> be delivered from his afflictions, and have not only his life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, but the comforts of it reſtored to him. As if he had ſayd, <hi>Be not afraid, doe not look upon thy condition as hopeleſs, or that the humiliation of thy ſelfe will be fruitleſſe, for I dare aſſure thee, God hath gracious purpoſes and intendments towards thee in working theſe things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here we have a two-fold gracious purpoſe of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; Firſt, to deliver him from evill, <hi>to bring back his ſoule from the pit.</hi> Secondly, to doe him good, or to beſtow poſitive bleſſings upon him (as was ſhewed at the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe) even <hi>to be enlightned with the light of the living;</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>God in all this aymes only at mans good, that his ſin unrepented of be not his death and deſtruction, and that under a ſence of Divine favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, he may lead a comfortable life here, and be happy for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>To bring back his ſoule from the pit.</q>
                  <p>It is ſayd at the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>He will deliver his ſoule from going into the pit;</hi> in both places the pit is the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing the Lord there promiſed to deliver his ſoule from going into the pit, how is he ſayd here, <hi>to bring back his ſoule from the pit?</hi> A man being delivered from going to the pit, cannot be ſayd to be brought back from the pit.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer in two things; the words rendred <hi>to bring back his ſoule from the pit,</hi> may be read thus; <hi>to turne away his ſoule from the pit;</hi> that is, to preſerve him from death. So the Hebrew word is uſed (<hi>Chap:</hi> 15.13.) as alſo (<hi>Mal:</hi> 2.6.) <hi>He walked with me in peace and equity, and did turne away many from iniquity.</hi> If we take that rendring of the word, then the expreſſions in both places beare the ſame ſence. But taking it according to our read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in which <hi>to bring back his ſoule from the pit,</hi> ſounds, as if the man had been in the pit already; and it may well be ſayd ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a man in great affliction, whether of ſoule or body, is, as it were, dead, or buried alive. For as when God converts a ſinner, he (upon the matter) brings him back from hell; ſo when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers him from any grievous ſickneſs, he doth (upon the matter) bring him back from the grave. <hi>Heman</hi> in ſpirituall afflictions and ſoule-deſertions, the terrours of the Lord being upon him, called himſelfe <hi>free among the dead, like the ſlaine that lye in the grave,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:104248:246"/> whom God remembreth no more, and they are cut off from thy hand, (Pſal:</hi> 88.5.) They that are neere the pit of death, are not, much, improperly, called dead, and they that being in ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate caſe are kept from going downe to the pit, are not, much, improperly ſayd to be brought back from the pit, or pulled out of it. In which ſence we may keep to our owne reading; and ſo to <hi>bring back his ſoule from the pit,</hi> notes only the extreame danger wherein he was, whether ſpirituall or temporall, and Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs in delivering him from it.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>When God reſtores a man out of any deſperate condition, whether of ſoule or body, he gives him a new life; he brings him in one reſpect back from the grave, and in another from hell.</q>
                  <p>As a ſick man, he is brought from the grave, and as a ſinner he is brought from hell. Great deliverances are a kind of new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And freſh bleſſings are to us as freſh beings. Take theſe two inferences from it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, How ſhould they, who have been under great outward afflictions, praiſe the Lord when they are delivered! They who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had the ſentence of death in themſelves, ſhould look upon themſelves when reſtored, as men raiſed from the dead. And how ſhould ſinners praiſe the Lord, when he hath reconciled them to himſelfe, and pardoned their ſins. In doing this for them, he delivereth them from wrath, from hell, and from eternall death. Let ſuch praiſe the name of the Lord, and ſay, as in the text, <hi>He hath delivered our ſoules from the pit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let ſuch live unto God, having received a new life from God; They that have received a new temporall life from God, ought to dedicate it unto God; how much more they that have received new ſpirituall life? They that have received it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, cannot but dedicate it unto God. This negative mercy calls aloud for all that we are or have to be given up to God, but that poſitive mercy which followeth, calleth yet lowder for it.</p>
                  <q>And to be enlightned with the light of the living.</q>

<pb n="471" facs="tcp:104248:246"/> others enlarge it to the light of ſpirituall and eternall life. We are <hi>enlightned with the light of the living,</hi> When the comforts of this life are reſtored, much more are they, who are reſtored to the comforts of their ſpirituall life, and ſo to the hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>the living,</hi> we are not to underſtand thoſe who are barely on this ſide the grave, and yet breath in the ayre; or who have only a weake ſhadowed ſpirituall life, which they ſcarce know of or perceive. The <hi>living</hi> here are they that live comfortably and proſperouſly both as to ſoule and body. Thus 'tis ſayd in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of Chriſt (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 72.13.) <hi>He ſhall live, and to him ſhall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer alſo ſhall be made for him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and dayly ſhall he be praiſed.</hi> Chriſt lives to purpoſe, he lives as a Prince, in power and dignity, yea he is the Prince of life. It was more then a ſenſitive or rationall life which <hi>Davids</hi> faith was aſſured of, when he ſayd (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 118.17.) <hi>I ſhall not dye but live;</hi> his meaning was, I ſhall live honourably and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly, declaring (with joy) the workes of the Lord. Thus here, <hi>To be enlightned with the light of the living,</hi> is, to enjoy a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable life, or to live happily.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>A troubled ſtate is a dark ſtate, ſickneſs and ſorrow, whether inward or outward, are darkneſs.</q>
                  <p>They are darkned with the darkneſs of the dead, whoſe life is wrapped up in anguiſh and ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>The deſigne and purpoſe of God in all his ordinances, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences towards his people is for their good.</q>
                  <p>All that hath been ſayd before, emptieth it ſelfe into theſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>To keep back his ſoule from the pit, and to be enlightned with the light of the living.</hi> The Lord hath no eye in theſe workes to his owne gaine, but mans good. <hi>The Lord doth not willingly grieve, nor afflict the children of men.</hi> (Lam: 3.35.) He taketh no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in it abſtractly conſidered, nor doth he look for any profit by it: Much leſſe doth he it (as it follows, <hi>v.</hi> 36.) meerely <hi>to cruſh under his feete all the priſoners of the earth.</hi> All that he expects by it as to himſelfe is to be glorified by all (for himſelfe is above
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:104248:247"/> all, and therefore deſigneth himſelfe in all) yet the glory which God hath by man is only the manifeſtation of his glory, not any addition to it. The benefit which God aymes at in afflicting man returnes to man. He would have man bettered by affliction, and as ſoone as man is bettered by affliction, every thing ſhall goe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with him, and he ſhall be delivered from affliction. (<hi>Rom:</hi> 8.28.) <hi>All things worke together for the good of them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpoſe.</hi> And as all things worke together for the good of them, who are the called accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his purpoſe, ſo it is the purpoſe of God that all things ſhould worke together for their good, and that is not a ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs purpoſe. Indeed every rod upon the backs of the wicked hath a voyce in it, to call them from the pit of death and deſtruction, and to be enlightned with the light of the living, but God makes this call effectuall to all his elect, none of whom ſhall periſh with the world. So that a godly man ſhould be ſo farre from judging himſelfe dealt with as an enemy (as <hi>Job</hi> in his extremity did) when he is moſt ſorely afflicted, that indeed he may ſee the love and fatherly care of God in it. All the providentiall diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God worke to glorious ends. Sometimes for the outward good of his people in this life, alwayes for good as to their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, lay aſide hard thoughts of God whatſoever hard things he is a doing, or you are ſuffering. The wayes in which God leads us, may poſſibly be very darke, yet they run to this poynt, to keep us from the pit of darkneſs, and that we may be enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the light of the living.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>Man would undoe himſelfe both for here and for ever, if God did not worke wonderfully for him, and powerfully keep him from deſtruction.</q>
                  <p>All theſe things God worketh twice and thrice, to keep our ſoules from the pit; man left to himſelfe would run head-long upon miſchiefe in this world, &amp; upon eternall miſery in the world to come. Nothing but the hand of God can hold man from ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe. The heart of man is ſo ſet upon ſin, that he will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looſe his ſoule, then leave his luſt; and will rather dye then that ſhall. 'Tis as eaſie to ſtay the motion of the Sun, or to turne
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:104248:247"/> back the courſe of nature, as to ſtay or turne back the naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or courſe of the heart in ſinning. An almighty power muſt doe the latter as well as the former. So that if the Lord did not put forth more then mercy, even mercy clothed with power, no man could be ſaved; ſhould God wiſh us never ſo well, and tell us what good he hath layd up for us, if we will but believe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him; ſhould he tell us he hath riches of mercy, and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one who will come ſhall have his ſhare, yet we ſhould never have any, if left to our owne chuſing. 'Tis a worke therefore both of mercy and power which keepes us from the pit. God had much adoe to keepe <hi>Lot</hi> from being conſumed in <hi>Sodome.</hi> He had warning to be gone, yet he was loth to goe; The text ſaith (<hi>Gen:</hi> 19.16.) <hi>While Lot lingred the men layd hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters, the Lord being mercifull to him, and they brought him forth, and ſet him without the City;</hi> elſe probably he had lingred, till he had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. Surely if God did not thruſt ſinners out of the <hi>Sodome</hi> of this world (as we ſay) by head and ſhoulders, they would pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in it and with it. How wonderfull is the goodneſſe of God who doth all theſe things, not only to keep poore creatures from going downe to the pit, both temporally, and eternally, but alſo that they <hi>may be enlightned with the light of the living.</hi>

But did not forbeare to diſcover it by ſome ſignificant geſture or frowne, and that <hi>Elihu</hi> perceiving this, deſired him to hold his peace; As if he had ſayd, If you deſire to reape any benefit by what I ſpeak, be patient, and doe not interrupt me. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there was no ſuch height nor heate of ſpirit in <hi>Job</hi> at that time; He began now to be ſedate and quiet enough, being ſomewhat convinced of his former error and intemperance of ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay; was it not an over-bold part in <hi>Elihu</hi> a young man to impoſe ſilence upon <hi>Job,</hi> or to bid him <hi>hold his peace?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer; <hi>Elihu</hi> doth not bid <hi>Job</hi> hold his peace, either, firſt, as if he had ſeene him unwilling to let him ſpeake, or would not heare him any more; <hi>Job</hi> was a very patient hearer; he heard his friends patiently, and he had heard <hi>Elihu</hi> too with ſilence and patience, yea though <hi>Elihu</hi> offered him leave, yea almoſt provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him to ſpeake (<hi>v.</hi> 5.) yet he did not but gave him ſcope to ſpeake out. Nor did <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeake this, ſecondly, as if he ſlighted <hi>Job,</hi> or thought him a man unable to anſwer him, or ſpeake to purpoſe, for preſently in the next verſe he deſireth him againe to ſpeake. Nor thirdly, as if he had ſuch high thoughts of his owne wiſdome, and loved ſo much to heare himſelfe ſpeake (as ſome men doe) that he cared not to heare others, but would engroſſe all the diſcourſe. Nor was it, fourthly, becauſe he ſaw ſuch an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation in <hi>Job</hi> to ſpeake, that he needed (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome, <hi>Tit:</hi> 1.11.) <hi>to have his mouth ſtopt.</hi> It was not upon any of theſe or ſuch like reaſons, that <hi>Elihu</hi> deſired <hi>Job</hi> to hold his peace; but it was either firſt, that himſelfe might ſpeak more clearely, and carry his matter through to his underſtanding; or ſecondly, that he might ſet the matter more home upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and move him to conſider yet more ſeriouſly what he had
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:104248:250"/> ſayd, of the various wayes of Gods dealing with man to humble his ſoule, and bring him neerer to himſelfe; or laſtly, that <hi>Job</hi> might perceive and take notice, that he was the man aymed at in all the foregoing parable. As if he had ſayd, Sir downe quietly, and conſider with thy ſelfe, whether all this diſcourſe hath tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or whether or no thou art not the man intended in it. As Chriſt when he had ſpoken that parable of the ſower concluded (<hi>Math:</hi> 13.9.) <hi>He that hath an eare to heare, let him heare;</hi> that is, let him take it home to himſelfe; or as Chriſt concludeth his Epiſtles to the ſeven Churches in the ſecond and third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> with, <hi>He that hath an eare, let him heare what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches;</hi> ſo doth <hi>Elihu</hi> to <hi>Job</hi> in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, <hi>Mark-well, O Job, and hearken unto me, hold thy peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſilence was made of old in great aſſemblyes <hi>(Majeſtate manus)</hi> by putting the hand to the mouth, and then ſtretching it forth. <hi>Acts</hi> 12.17. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.16. <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.23. <hi>Chap.</hi> 26.1.</p>
                  <p>If any would know yet more diſtinctly what <hi>Elihu</hi> meant when he bid <hi>Job hold his peace?</hi> I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Negatively, not a bare ſilence, or ſaying nothing, but affirmatively, when he ſayth, <hi>hold thy peace;</hi> it might note theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That he would have him much in the worke of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or to forbeare ſpeaking, that he might be more in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and weighing, and laying things to heart; he would have him bring what he had ſpoken to the ballance of the Sanctuary, and then to his owne heart. A man is never more buſie then when he thus holds his peace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When he ſaith, <hi>hold thy peace,</hi> it might note that he deſired his ſubmiſſion to the counſel given, or to be given him; He would have him bridle his tongue, in token that his ſpirit was brideled. He would have <hi>Jobs</hi> ſilence ſay, ſpeake on, I will ſay nothing, let the truth of God reigne and rule over me by thy word. What <hi>Samuel</hi> anſwered to the Lord himſelfe (1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 3.10.) <hi>Speak Lord, for thy ſervant heareth;</hi> that ſhould we anſwer to thoſe who ſpeak to us from the Lord; ſpeak ye, we will heare and hold our peace: or we ſhould ſay with good <hi>Cornelius,</hi> when <hi>Peter</hi> came to him (<hi>Acts</hi> 10.33.) <hi>We are all here preſent before God, to heare all things that are commanded thee of God.</hi> When a man holds his peace (upon theſe termes) 'tis a ſigne he layeth
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:104248:250"/> downe his owne wiſdome, and his will, he doth not ſtand upon his <hi>pantofloes</hi> (as we ſay) nor abound in his owne ſence, but is ready to be delivered or caſt into the mould of any holy and wholeſome doctrine which ſhall be delivered unto him. <hi>They are in the fitteſt frame to hold the truth which others ſpeake, who can withhold themſelves from ſpeaking.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, There is a two-fold <hi>holding of the peace.</hi> Firſt, at the works of God, or at what God doth (<hi>Lev:</hi> 10.3.) when God had ſmitten the two ſons of <hi>Aaron</hi> dead with fire fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m heaven, <hi>Aaron held his peace;</hi> that is, he did not murmure at, nor contradict what God had done. That alſo was <hi>Davids</hi> temper (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 39.9.) <hi>I was dumbe, I opened not my mouth, becauſe thou Lord didſt it.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> deſcribes an humbled ſoule in the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture (<hi>Lam:</hi> 3.28.) <hi>He ſitteth alone and keepeth ſilence, becauſe he hath borne it upon him.</hi> When God layeth his yoke or croſſe upon us, 'tis our duty to be ſilent and ſubmit (<hi>Zach:</hi> 2.13.) <hi>Be ſilent, O all fleſh, before the Lord: for he is raiſed up out of his holy habitation,</hi> that is, the Lord begins to worke, therefore let all men, or men of all ſorts and degrees be quiet and ſay nothing either diſcontentedly or complainingly. In all theſe Scriptures, <hi>holding our peace</hi> is called for and commanded or ſhewed at the workes of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a holding of our peace at the word of God, or at what God ſpeaketh. Thus 'tis when not only the tongue but the heart is ſilent, and every thought is brought into ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or captivity to the obedience of Chriſt. The heart of man of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſpeakes much, and is very clamorous, when he ſaith nothing with his tongue. That's to hold our peace indeed, when the heart is quiet, let God ſay or doe what he will. 'Tis not more our duty <hi>to reſiſt the Devill,</hi> that is, all his helliſh whiſperings and temptations to the doing of evill, then 'tis <hi>to ſubmit to God</hi> in all his ſpeakings and diſpenſations. <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaking in the name of the Lord, faithfully adviſeth <hi>Job</hi> in this ſence, to <hi>hold his peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence learne.</p>
                  <q>We ought to ſubmit and keep ſilence when the truth of God is ſpoken. <hi>Or,</hi> when the minde of God is brought unto us, there muſt be no replying but obeying, no diſputing but ſubmitting.</q>
                  <p>They have learned much, who know how and when to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:104248:251"/> 
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith (<hi>Eccl:</hi> 3.6.) <hi>There is a time to keep ſilence, and a time to ſpeake;</hi> but this kind of ſilence is in ſeaſon at all times, we ought alwayes to be ſilent thus, that is, alwayes ſubmit to the minde of God. We need to be minded of this, becauſe the pride and over-weening of man is great. We have need to put a bridle upon our tongues, much more upon our hearts; it is hard to bring our wills and our underſtandings under; we are apt to ſtrive and ſtruggle when truth comes neere us; yea to kick at it, when it comes very nee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> and home to us, though indeed the neerer it comes the better, nor can it ever come too neere. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> apprehended this when he gave that admonition (<hi>Chap:</hi> 1.21.) <hi>Receive with meekneſſe, the ingraffed word, which is able to ſave your ſoules:</hi> Meekneſſe is that grace which moderates anger; a paſſionate or fierce ſpirit, receiveth not the word, but riſeth up againſt it, turnes not to it but upon it; and, which is worſt of all, turnes it to evill, not to good, turnes light into darkneſſe; and ſo the word of life becomes a ſavour of death for want of a due ſubmiſſion to it. Therefore <hi>hearken, and hold your peace</hi> when the word of God is ſpoken. Do not ſay it is but the word of man, becauſe delivered by man; God ſpeaks in and by his faithfull Meſſengers; ye oppoſe the authority of the living God, not a mortall dying creature, when you reject the word. And remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, it is not only our duty but our liberty to give up our ſelves priſoners to the truths of God; we are never ſo free as when bound by it or to it. And as we ſhould hold our peace at or ſubmit to all the truths of God in all caſes, ſo eſpecially in theſe three.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When we are reproved for our ſins in practice; then we ſhould not ſtand excuſing what we have done, but repent of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When we are ſhewed our errour in opinion; then we ſhould not ſtand diſputing, and arguing for what we hold, but recant it. 'Tis time to hold our peace, when once it appeares to us, that we doe not hold the truth. To erre is common to man, but to perſevere in an errour, to the defence and patronage of it, is more then inhumane, deviliſh.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We ſhould hold our peace when our duty is plaine before us; then we ſhould not ſtand queſtioning it, but doe it. <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to doe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon, Eccl:</hi> 9.10.
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:104248:251"/> that is, whatſoever appeares to be a duty) <hi>doe it with all thy might.</hi> Hold thy tongue, but doe not withhold thy hand when once thy hand hath found what muſt be done. <hi>Elihu</hi> at this time was dealing with <hi>Job</hi> upon all theſe three poynts; He told him his ſin, that he had been too querious and impatient, he ſhewed him his error, that he had been too bold with God, becauſe inn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent towards men; And he preſſed him to duty, both that, and how he ought to humble himſelfe before the Lord. The Apoſtle treating about that great poynt of juſtification, tells us God will at laſt cauſe all men to hold their peace. (<hi>Rom:</hi> 3.19.) <hi>Now we know that what things ſoever the law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are under the law, that every month may be ſtopped, and all the world may become guilty before God;</hi> that is, man will have nothing to ſay, but ſit downe ſilent, and hold his peace, or only ſay, I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I have deſerved nothing but death and condemnation, when he once underſtands the holineſs and ſtrictneſs of the law, together with the unholineſs and looſeneſs of his owne heart and life.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>It ſpeakes yea proclaimes a gracious prudence, to know how and when to hold our peace and ſay nothing.</q>
                  <p>When men inſiſt upon their owne conceit and reaſon, when they logick it unduely with God or men, and will needs ſeeme to know more then the word teacheth them, what doe they but give evidence againſt themſelves, that as yet they know nothing as the word teacheth, or as they ought to know, and themſelves leaſt of all? 'Tis pride and preſumption, not prudence and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which opens ſuch mens mouths. We never profit by what we heare, till (in the ſence opened) we have learned <hi>to hold our peace.</hi> The counſel which <hi>Elihu</hi> gave <hi>Job,</hi> was to hold his peace; yet he layd no conſtraint upon him to refraine neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſpeaking, but put him upon it in the next verſe.</p>

But when firſt, we will not heare an anſwer, or when ſecondly, we ſuppreſſe our oppoſites with power and violence, whom we cannot anſwer or convince by
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:104248:253"/> argument; or thirdly, when we interpret what they ſay in anſwer to the worſt ſence; or fourthly, when we are glad to finde any weakneſs or inſufficiency in their anſwers, and are ſo haſty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, that we will not give them leave to recollect their thoughts, or thinke better on't to mend their anſwers, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine their meaning, either by ſpeech or writing; it is impoſſible breaches ſhould be healed, &amp; differences reconciled, or that ever we ſhould come to a cleare &amp; full underſtanding of one another. This offer made by <hi>Elihu</hi> to <hi>Job</hi> is a good patterne, and ſhewes us how to deale with brethren in all ſuch caſes: and that which followeth ſheweth the beſt and nobleſt ground of ſuch amicable condiſcentions, even a willingneſs not only to agree with but to embrace thoſe from whom we differ. That's the generall ſence of what <hi>Elihu</hi> aſſureth <hi>Job,</hi> and would have him confident of in the next words.</p>

                     </note> or deſire at reſt. As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſayd, <hi>I have not ſpoken out of ill will to thee, or deſire of victory over thee, nor would any thing be more welcome newes to my ſoule, then to ſee juſt cauſe of juſtifying thee; it doth not pleaſe me at all to prove that thou art not juſt, it would extreamly pleaſe me, even raviſh my heart with joy if thou couldſt prove thy ſelfe or thy cauſe ſo juſt and fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, that nothing could be blamed or reproved in either. I deſire to juſtifie thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, not only to judge thee a godly man, or a man fearing God (which I already doe) but to judge that thou haſt in all things both done and ſpoken well, which as yet I doe not, nor can,
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:104248:253"/> unleſſe thou ſheweſt me better reaſon for it then hitherto thou haſt done. <hi>To juſtifie</hi> another is foure wayes applyed in Scripture; as was ſhewed more largely at the ſecond verſe of the former Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Firſt and chiefly 'tis applyed or attributed to God himſelfe (<hi>Rom:</hi> 8.33.) <hi>It is God that juſtifieth.</hi> God puts man into a ſtate of juſtification, he juſtifieth his perſon ſo fully, that none can (of right) lay any thing to his charge, much leſſe condemne him upon any charge layd againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Man juſtifieth God (<hi>Luke</hi> 7.29, 30.) <hi>And all the people that heard him, and the Publicans juſtified God, being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with the baptiſme of John.</hi> God himſelfe who is the Judge of all men, is condemned by many men; and when things are at worſt, he alwayes hath ſome to juſtifie him. Man juſtifieth God when he honoureth God, taking his part, and owning both his power and his righteouſneſſe in whatſoever he doth. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible God ſhould be unjuſt, and God is pleaſed to ſay, we juſtifie him, when we maintaine his wayes as juſt and righteous.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Man juſtifieth himſelfe, when he is either lifted up proudly in the thoughts of what he is or hath done well (<hi>Luke</hi> 18.11.) or when he upon good grounds can maintaine that to be well done which he hath done.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Man juſtifieth man, when he either conſents to, or approves of what he hath done or ſpoken, whether it be good or bad; he that approves of a man juſtifies him, though the man be unjuſt. (<hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15.) <hi>He that juſtifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the juſt, even they both are an abomination unto the Lord.</hi> Let a man be never ſo wicked, and doe never ſo wickedly, ſome through ignorance of his wickedneſſe, and others through love to and liking of his wickedneſſe, (being ſuch themſelves) will approve of him, and give him their good word. But (as Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.19.) <hi>Wiſdome is juſtified of her children;</hi> that is, the true lovers and followers of wiſdome, having a right knowledge and eſtimation of her worth, will ſtand by her, and ſpeake for her, when ſlighted by the blind and unknowing world. And as this is true of declarative wiſdome, ſo eſpecially of Chriſt, who is <hi>eſſentiall wiſdome.</hi> His children highly prize and juſtifie him, while the world condemns and contemns him. In this fourth ſence <hi>Elihu</hi> is to be underſtood here, <hi>I deſire to juſtifie thee;</hi> that
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:104248:254"/> is, to give teſtimony unto thee, or ſubſcribe thy certificate, that thou art worthy of commendation. Though <hi>Elihu</hi> was a man of a very warme and keene ſpirit, full of fire, and mettle, yet he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a very honeſt bent, and a well governed intention towards <hi>Job,</hi> in ſaying, <hi>I deſire to juſtifie thee;</hi> for 'tis as if he had ſaid; <hi>It would not pleaſe me at all to ſee cauſe of further cenſure, but it would pleaſe me fully to ſee cauſe of approving and acquitting thee.</hi> Therefore doe but ſtate thy caſe and make out the merits of it, and I ſhall yield ſo ſoon as I ſee cauſe. So then, <hi>Elihu</hi> did not carry himſelf in this buſineſs, firſt, as a party, or as one that had taken a ſide, and was reſolved to hold it (as ſome doe) right or wrong, becauſe he had appeared in it. Nor Secondly, was he hurryed by paſſion, or intemperance of ſpirit. Nor Thirdly, was he hood-winkt by prejudice, or fore-ſtalled by his opinion againſt the perſon. Nor Fourthly, was he engaged by love to contention or hopes of victory. Nor Fifthly, was he purpoſed to ſuppreſſe ſmother or keepe downe the truth. Nor Sixthly, had he any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to aſperſe <hi>Job,</hi> and make him appear black. Nor Seventhly, had he a mind to grieve the man, or burthen him with accuſations; but declared a cleare candor and much melting compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his afflicted Antagoniſt, hungring and thirſting, yea even longing for a juſt occaſion to juſtifie him.</p>

                  <p>Hence note, Firſt.</p>
                  <q>A good man is glad to ſee any mans cauſe or caſe prove good, or better then he thought it.</q>
                  <p>The Apoſtle giving ſeverall Characters of Goſpell love or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſaith (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.6.) <hi>It rejoyceth not in iniquity, but rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in the truth.</hi> As charity rejoyceth not in the doing of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo neither doth it, when others are found to have done iniquity. But it rejoyceth much, when any who are either ſuſpected or
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:104248:254"/> charged with iniquity, are upon due tryall found cleare and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted. <hi>Paul</hi> wiſhed that all who heard him had been not only almoſt but altogether ſuch as he, except his bonds, (<hi>Acts</hi> 26.29.) It is a great argument that a man is good and juſt, when he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſheth that he who hath given occaſion to others to think ill of him, may at laſt appeare better then they thought him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly note.</p>
                  <q>A good man ſeekes not victory but truth, and the good of thoſe he deals with.</q>
                  <p>When he contends earneſtly with others, he deſires as earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that truth may gaine by that contention. Where a ſpirit of ſtrife &amp; uncharitableneſs poſſeſſeth the minds of many men, they love to be vexing &amp; trampling upon thoſe they deale with, rather then helping and enforming them. <hi>This evill ſpirit is the familiar of this age;</hi> That which the Apoſtle ſpake (<hi>Phil.</hi> 1.15.) of not a few who had the name of Goſpel Miniſters (<hi>ſome preach Chriſt even of envy and ſtrife, and ſome alſo of good will;</hi> the one preach Chriſt of contention, not ſincerely) the ſame may be ſaid of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſputers and polemicall writers; they doe it enviouſly, they doe it out of love to ſtrife and contention, not out of love either to truth or to thoſe with whom they contend and ſtrive; this is a bad ſpirit, a ſpirit far unlike that which ruled in <hi>Elihu,</hi> who wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the ſharpeſt reprehenſions he gave <hi>Job,</hi> might end in his juſtification. There ſhould be ſuch a ſpirit in man contending with man, as there is in God contending with man; who doth not thunder againſt ſinners, becauſe he would have them periſh, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in their deſtruction; but doth it, firſt, to awaken them; ſecondly, to humble them; thirdly, to convert them; fourthly, to juſtifie them; and laſtly, to ſave them for ever. <hi>I write not theſe things</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.14.) <hi>to ſhame you, but as my beloved ſons I warne you.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I intend not to aſperſe you, or throw dirt upon you, but only adviſe you to wipe off the dirt that is caſt upon you, or to keep your ſelves out of the dirt. I would either be a means to cleanſe you, or provoke you to preſerve your ſelves cleane.</p>
                  <p>Note Thirdly.</p>
                  <q>It is our duty to juſtifie thoſe whom we oppoſe, when they can clear themſelves.</q>
                  <pb n="488" facs="tcp:104248:255"/>
                  <p>As <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpake very ingeniouſly, ſo not at all beyond his duty; we ſhould be glad when they whom we have ſuſpected or charged appeare faire, or better then we ſuſpected; he that doth ſo muſt be juſtified: as we muſt not hold the truth of God, ſo we muſt not hold the credit of our neighbour in unrighteouſneſs. We ſhould have three ends in dealing and debating with others. Firſt, to convince them of their errours and ſins. Secondly, to recover them out of ſin and errour. Thirdly, to acquit them in what they appeare and can approve themſelves not to have ſinned or erred. <hi>Elihu</hi> aimed at and attained the firſt and ſecond in his debate with <hi>Job;</hi> and it would have been a greater contentment to him, if (there being no need of thoſe two) he had ſeene cauſe only to have done the third. <hi>Speak</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>for I deſire to juſtifie thee.</hi>

                  <p>Further, when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will teach thee wiſdome;</hi> his meaning is, I ſhall acquaint thee with that which may make thee wiſe, or I ſhall ſhew thee wherein true wiſdome doth conſiſt. And that conſiſts chiefly in theſe two things. Firſt, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our ſelves; Secondly, in the knowledge of God; As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid, <hi>I doubt not but I ſhall make thee know more fully what thou art, as alſo who God is.</hi> And it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeares in the cloſe, that <hi>Job</hi> got a fuller light in both by what <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaid to him: He got a ſuller ſoul-ſight of the ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and highneſſe of God, and a deeper humiliation in the ſight of his own ſinfullneſs and vileneſſe. He that hath learned and is in the power of theſe two leſſons, is queſtionleſs a wiſe man; and he that faithfully teacheth theſe two leſſons doth not at all over-rate his doctrine if he call it wiſdome, nor doth he put too high a title upon his paines and endeavours, if he ſaith to his Auditors or Schollars, I will teach or have taught you wiſdome.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, When <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will teach thee wiſdome;</hi> we muſt not conceive that he looked upon <hi>Job</hi> as unwiſe or ignorant; <hi>Elihu</hi> knew well enough he had not to doe with a child or an ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, but with a man of knowledge, with a man who was <hi>skilfull in the word of righteouſneſſe, whoſe ſenſes</hi> (as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14.) <hi>were exerciſed to diſcern both good and evill.</hi> His meaning then, when he ſaid <hi>I will teach thee wiſdome,</hi> was only this, I will teach thee to be wiſer and more knowing in ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary truths, then as yet thou art, or at leaſt, haſt appeared to be. Or we may give his ſence in the language of the Apoſtle, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24.) I will teach thee wiſdome, not as <hi>having domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over thy faith, but as a helper of thy joy.</hi>

                  <p>Hence note, Firſt.</p>
                  <q>There are none ſo wiſe, none ſo holy, but they may learne more wiſdome, to be yet more holy.</q>
                  <p>'Tis out of queſtion, he was never good, who thinks he can be no better; nor doth he yet know any thing aright, who ſaith he needs know no more. It is very ſad (which is the caſe of many, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.7.) to be <hi>ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth:</hi> Yet they who (through grace) have been enabled to come to the knowledge of the truth muſt be ever learning; and the more any man doth know, the more he ſeeth his need, and the more willing he is, to be taught and know more. <hi>The feare of God that is wiſdome,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> (Chap. 28.28.) <hi>and to depart from evill, is underſtanding;</hi> and God teſtified of <hi>Job</hi> that <hi>he feared him, and eſchewed evill,</hi> in the firſt verſe of this Booke; now if ſo wiſe, ſo good a man as <hi>Job</hi> might learne wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, let none think themſelves too wiſe or too good to learne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>True wiſdome conſiſts in the true knowledge of our ſelves, and of God.</q>
                  <p>This was the theame or ſubject upon which <hi>Elihu</hi> inſiſted, he was not teaching <hi>Job</hi> humane, philoſophicall, or naturall wiſdome, but heavenly and divine wiſdome; the greateſt meere naturall Philoſophers in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which title ſounds them, <hi>lovers of wiſdome</hi>) were meere ſtrangers to that, which we call true wiſdom; and (as the Apoſtle chargeth them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21, 22.) <hi>became vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkened, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing themſelves to be wiſe, they became fools.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>There is nothing worth the learning or knowing, but that which makes us truly wiſe.</q>
                  <p>For that only ſheweth us the way to be truly happy. 'Tis our wiſdome to work for a right end, and that work can never attaine its end but by the choyce of right means. <hi>Through deſire</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 18.1.) <hi>a man having ſeparated himſelf, ſeeketh and intermedleth with all wiſdome.</hi> The deſire of all things (ſay
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:104248:256"/> Naturaliſts) eſpecially of all men runs out to good. And the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any man is, the better is that good which he deſireth, yea if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man be truly good he deſireth that which is beſt; for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God wherein alone happineſſe doth conſiſt, is his ultimate and higheſt end. But what doth he to reach this end? <hi>Solomon</hi> poynts us to two things: Firſt, he ſeparateth himſelfe from all thoſe lets and impediments which ſtop up the way, or lye croſſe to his deſire. Secondly, <hi>He ſeeketh and intermedleth with all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> with all reall and ſubſtantiall wiſdome, (as the word there uſed ſignifieth) for he knoweth that nothing but ſuch wiſdome, acted in wiſe wayes, is proper and ſucceſſefull for the promoting of that noble end. Now if nothing but wiſdome can lead us to that end, what is there worth the learning or knowing except that which makes us wiſe?</p>

                  <q>They that are humble and meek are fitteſt to learne wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble. (Jam.</hi> 4.6.) The humble ſoule hath received grace already, and that grace received is the way to all grace. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.9.) <hi>The meek will he guide in judgment, the meek will he teach his way.</hi> The way of God is wiſdome, and they whom God teacheth ſhall undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly learne it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly.</p>
                  <q>To teach ſpirituall wiſdome, or to teach man how to be ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wiſe, is the best leſſon that can be taught.</q>
                  <p>They are bleſſed Maſters who make ſuch Schollars. The whole diſcourſe of <hi>Elihu</hi> is about ſpirituall wiſdome, not about the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the world which God will deſtroy; not how to climbe the pinnacles of honour, and get high in the world, not how to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther riches, and to lade our ſelves with thick clay; it was not how to be great or rich, but it was how to be holy and humble, how to give glory to God, and be fitted for glory with God; theſe were the leſſons of wiſdome which <hi>Elihu</hi> taught <hi>Job,</hi> and
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:104248:257"/> theſe are leſſons chiefly to be taught and learned by every man, who undertakes to be a teacher, or deſires to be a learner. Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> hath concluded his firſt diſcourſe with a promiſe to teach <hi>Job</hi> wiſdome, and how well he performed and made good his promiſe, will appeare, to his praiſe, in opening the following Chapters.</p>

But perceiving him ſilent, and forbearing to ſpeak; he himſelfe proceeds to this ſecond ſpeech.</p>
               <p>In which we may conſider:</p>
               <p>Firſt, His Preface, in the foure firſt verſes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, His charge or accuſation brought againſt <hi>Job,</hi> from the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe Incluſively to the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Excluſively.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We have the refutation of what <hi>Job</hi> ſaid of himſelfe, and ſeem'd to charge upon God; this is proſecuted with much variety from the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>In the foure laſt verſes, <hi>Elihu</hi> gathers up the ſtrength of all he had ſayd, and makes his Concluſion.</p>
               <p>The foure verſes now under hand, are a Preface to this ſecond undertaking of <hi>Elihu</hi> with <hi>Job:</hi> In which we have</p>
               <p>Firſt, His tranſition from what he had ſaid, to what he was about to ſay, in the firſt verſe; <hi>Furthermore.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, We have his motion; and the motion which he makes, is, that the whole proceedure of the buſineſſe might be both faire and friendly, as alſo judicious and juſt; or that they might to the utmoſt endeavour after a right underſtanding and diſcerning of the matter before them: <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>Let us chuſe to our ſelves judgement,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>It may here be queſtioned, by what propriety of ſpeech it can be ſaid that <hi>Elihu</hi> anſwered, ſeeing <hi>Job</hi> made no reply to what he had ſayd before.</p>
                  <p>To this query, I ſay, Firſt, that in Scripture both the beginning of a ſpeech, and the continuance of it, where nothing hath been interpoſed, is called an anſwer; we find it ſo frequently in the Goſpel (<hi>Math:</hi> 11.25.) <hi>Then Jeſus anſwered and ſaid:</hi> there was no queſtion, no diſcourſe antecedent, yet it is called an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. The like is obſervable in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Mathew,</hi> v. 4. and <hi>John</hi> 2.18.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may reſolve the doubt thus; though <hi>Job</hi> ſaid nothing now to which <hi>Elihu</hi> made anſwer; yet he had ſaid much which was yet unanſwered, altogether unanſwered by <hi>Elihu;</hi> therefore <hi>Elihu</hi> might ſay, that he proceeded to anſwer the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matters of <hi>Jobs</hi> former ſpeech, to which as yet he had given no anſwer. This may ſuffice to ſhew how or why that which he ſayd further, was an anſwer, let us now conſider what <hi>Elihu an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>As if he had ſaid, I will not be my owne Judge in this matter, I referre it to the judgement of wiſe and knowing men, let them determine it.</p>
                  <p>We may here take notice; Firſt, of the character given the perſons to whom <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpake, or did addreſs his ſpeech, they were <hi>wiſe men, men that had knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may take notice of the earneſtneſs of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation or admonition, to mind what he had to ſay, <hi>Give ear,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:104248:258"/> O ye wiſe men, O ye men that have knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the clearing of theſe words, we muſt enquire, firſt, who is <hi>a wiſe man?</hi> who, <hi>a man that hath knowledge? a wiſe man</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction to a man that hath knowledge, is a man of mature judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of cleare underſtanding, and ſolid prudence, in the manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either of diſcourſes or actions. <hi>A man of knowledge</hi> is one that hath improved his underſtanding by ſtudy, reading, or long experience. Some men are wiſe, who yet have not much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and ſome have a great deale of knowledge, who have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little wiſdome. Now <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks to his auditory, as conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or made up both of wiſe and knowing men; <hi>O ye wiſe men,</hi> that have great underſtanding and judgement; and, <hi>O ye men of knowledge,</hi> that have attained to learning and skill in all things knowable, heare my words and give eare. Here was a choice and ſelect auditory, wiſe men, and men of knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It may be queried, whom <hi>Elihu</hi> intends by theſe wiſe men, and men that had knowledge?</p>
                  <p>Some conceive, he takes in all that were preſent at that long and ſolemn conference between <hi>Job</hi> and his friends; and that he deciphers the whole Company under theſe titles of wiſe and knowing men, inviting them all to attend what he had to ſay, they being ſo well fitted to judge what he had to ſay; <hi>It is not good to give flattering titles to men, but it is good to give them winning ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, ſuch as may gaine upon them for their good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet I rather conceive, that <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeakes more ſpecially to ſome that were there preſent; namely, to <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends, who had had the matter in hand before, and now ſtood out: to theſe men he now turnes himſelfe, and bends his diſcourſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Heare O ye wiſe men: hearken ye that have knowledge;</hi> that is, ye <hi>Eliphaz, Zophar,</hi> and <hi>Bildad,</hi> who have all this while en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with <hi>Job,</hi> give me leave to ſpeake a few words in your eares, and I pray attend unto me.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Suppoſing that they, ſpecially, were the wiſe and knowing men to whom he ſpake. It may be queſtion'd againe, under what notion he called them wiſe and knowing men.</p>
                  <p>Some ſay, he called them ſo Ironically, putting a cloſe or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſcorn upon them; As if he had ſayd, <hi>Heare me, O ye wiſe men, and hearken, O ye knowing men, ye that for years and age ſhould be indeed knowing and wiſe men; and are ſo in the reputation
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:104248:259"/> of others, as well as by your owne profeſſion and pretention; Ye who came from farre to undertake this weighty worke, the comforting and counſelling of this your afflicted friend, ſee now how well you have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted your ſelves, and anſwered the expectation raiſed both of you and by you. Have ye not comforted him fairely, and counſelled him wiſely? Doe ye not ſee how ſhort you are of your owne propoſalls? and how ill you have handled the matter, he remaining as farre from conviction, ſatisfaction, or conſolation, as when you firſt began with him?</hi> Thus ſome carry the ſence, but I ſhall not ſtay upon it, nor doe I conceive that <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpake Ironically, but plainly, and in good earneſt, not only calling them wiſe and knowing men, but judging and believing they were ſo. Of theſe he beggs audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <q>Heare and give eare.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To heare</hi> is a naturall act; a man that hath ears cannot chuſe but heare (unleſſe he ſtop them) when any thing is ſpoken: but <hi>to give ear,</hi> is, as I may ſay, an artificiall act, a ſtudyed act, yea a ſpirituall act,<note place="margin">

                     </note> when the matter ſpoken of is ſpirituall. <hi>Elihu</hi> doth not call for a bare hearing of words, but for a ſtudious hearing of the matter which ſhould be preſented to them; <hi>heare and give eare;</hi> or as the Elegancy of the Hebrew may be rendred, <hi>ear my words:</hi> for the word which we render to <hi>give eare,</hi> ſignifies alſo <hi>the ear, ear my words.</hi> We ſay of a thing that we deſire another would reach to us, <hi>pray hand it hither,</hi> putting the denomination of the Organ or Inſtrument upon the act; ſo by a like Elegancy, it is here ſayd, <hi>Ear my words;</hi> that is, heare ſtudiouſly and diligently, with an holy art and skill. As there is an art in ſpeaking, ſo there is a great, if not a greater art in hearing; <hi>ear my words,</hi> or, <hi>give eare to me ye men that have knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the Conſideration of the parties here ſpoken to, wiſe and knowing men.</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>The wiſe, and knowing, are to heare as well as ſpeake.</q>
                  <p>They that are wiſe, need more wiſdome, and they that are knowing, may improve their knowledge by hearing; They who know many, yea moſt truths, may yet know more truths; and if any know all truths, they may yet know every truth more. This
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:104248:259"/> cauſed the Apoſtle to profeſſe (2 <hi>Pet:</hi> 1.12.) <hi>I will not be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to put you alwayes in remembrance of theſe things, though ye know them, and be eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth.</hi> As the ignorant ought to heare that they may know, ſo they who have knowledge, ought to heare, that they may be more knowing; as they that are fooles, ought to heare that they may be wiſe; ſo they that are wiſe ought to heare that they may be yet wiſer. (<hi>Pro:</hi> 1.5.) <hi>A wiſe man will heare, and will encreaſe learning. Solomon</hi> having ſayd in the former verſe, that he ſpake theſe Proverbs, <hi>To give ſubtlety to the ſimple, to the young men knowledge and diſcretion;</hi> leſt any ſhould ſay, if your Proverbs or wiſe ſentences are ſo plaine and eaſie, that the ſimple may ſound them, and young men compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, then what profit ſhall wiſe and learned men get by reading or hearing them? ſhall not they looſe their labour and miſ-pend their time in the ſtudy of them? No, ſaith he, the greateſt Clerkes and ripeſt wits may gather inſtruction from them, as well as the ſimple vulgar, and greener heads. Their depth will not drowne a lambe, and they are deep enough to ſwim a Leviathan. And therefore as a wiſe man will heare, that is, is willing to heare, that he may encreaſe learning; ſo let not the wiſeſt thinke themſelves too wiſe to heare, for they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their learning, how learned ſoever they are. And as the wiſeſt may learne every day, ſo they that are truely wiſe, doe learne every hearing day, as the ſame <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us (<hi>Prov:</hi> 9.8.) <hi>Give inſtruction to a wiſe man, and he will be yet wiſer.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sapientum eſt velle diſcere.</note> They are the moſt fooliſh of all men, who thinke themſelves ſo wiſe that they need no more inſtruction, and ſo knowing that they need learn no more knowledge. The word of God it is fitted for all ſorts and ſizes of men, it is for the ignorant, and for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it is for the fooliſh, and for the wiſe; it is milke for babes, and ſtrong meate for men; it is for them that are out of the Church to bring them in; and for thoſe that are within the Church to build them up (<hi>Eph:</hi> 4.13.) <hi>Till we all come unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt;</hi> till we are wiſe and knowing to perfection, and fullneſs of ſtature (which will not be on this ſide glory) we have need to give eare, and heare, for the perfecting of our knowledge, and the hightning of our ſtature.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Theſe wiſe men were called to heare and give eare,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:104248:260"/> not only that they might learn and encreaſe knowledge by what was ſpoken, but to judge aright of what was ſpoken; for this was not ſo much the hearing of a Sermon (as I may ſay) as of a diſpute, or the debate of a Controverſie; and therefore wiſe men were deſired to heare it, that they might, he able to judge, and give their opinion, (as 'tis ſayd in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe) <hi>Let us chuſe to our ſelves judgement, and know among our ſelves what is good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Secondly.</p>
                  <q>We had need to heare and give eare, or to heare diligently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we judge either of things or perſons.</q>
                  <p>Though we may judge rightly of that we have not heard, or of that which we have heard ſlightly, yet we are not right Judges of any matter till we have heard it. 'Tis poſſible to hit upon a right judgement blind-fold; but Judges muſt not be blind, nor judge blind-fold. To judge right, not knowing it to be ſo, ſhall have no better reward then a wrong judgement. Yea they that are called to judge, muſt both heare and give eare, elſe they may quickly give wrong judgement.</p>
                  <p>Againe, <hi>Elihu</hi> is ſpeaking here to wiſe and good men, yet how ſtrictly doth he exhort them? <hi>Heare and give eare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>Good men are often dull of hearing, and had need to be put forward.</q>
                  <p>Chriſt tells his Diſciples that many are judicially ſo, and we know that all are naturally ſo (<hi>Math:</hi> 13.15.) and the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> they were ſo (<hi>Chap:</hi> 5.11.) where treating of <hi>Chriſt called of God, an high Prieſt after the order of Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck,</hi> he concludeth, <hi>of whom we have many things to ſay, and hard to be uttered, ſeeing ye are dull of hearing.</hi> But how did their dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of hearing make thoſe things hard to be ſpoken or uttered? may it not be eaſie enough for a man to utter that which others are dull to heare? I anſwer, the Apoſtles meaning ſeemes to be this? It was hard for him to utter or expound them ſo, as they might perceive the cleare truth of thoſe great myſteries, becauſe their internal eare, or apprehending faculty was weake and dull. There is a ſtople in the eare of man, and 'tis hard to pull it out. When any one ſpeakes to purpoſe, 'tis the duty of thoſe that are
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:104248:260"/> preſent to heare: and yet he that ſpeakes had need to invite and preſſe all to heare, yea to heare and give eare. The words of the wiſe are goads to provoke and pricke us on to heare the truth, as well as nayles to faſten it (<hi>Eccl:</hi> 12.11.) <hi>Elihu</hi> having cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led wiſe men to heare or eare his words, ſheweth the uſe or force of the eare in the next verſe.</p>

Only there the ſentence is made up by a particle Copulative; <hi>The ear tryeth words, and the mouth taſteth meat.</hi> Here by a particle of likeneſs; <hi>The eare try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth words, as the mouth taſteth meat.</hi> There is a faire analogy or
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:104248:261"/> proportion, between the eare and the mouth, in diſcriminating their proper obiects. Hearing and taſting, are two of thoſe five excellent uſefull ſenſes which God hath planted in the nature of man, the other three are ſeeing, ſmelling, feeling. Here we have a compariſon between two of the five ſenſes; look what the mouth is to meat, the ſame is the ear to words. In the mouth the ſenſe of taſting is placed as a Judge to diſcerne between good and bad, ſavory and unſavory meates; and the eare of a man which receiveth words, is accompanied with an underſtanding, whereby we apprehend what is true, what is falſe, what is to be approved, and what refuſed. And the compariſon runs yet more clearely, while we conſider, that as the food which the mouth receiveth is prepared for the helpe of our natural or bodily life, ſo the words of inſtruction which the eare receiveth are prepared for the food of our ſoules, and the maintaining of our ſpirituall life.</p>
                  <p>Some conceive the compariſon is not here made between the two ſenſes of taſting and hearing, but that both are compared to thoſe wiſe and knowing men ſpoken of, and to whom appeale is made in the former verſe. For as all the ſenſes are not fitted to judge of words and meates, but only the eare and palate; ſo all men are not fit nor capable to judge of weighty matters and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found queſtions, but only wiſe and knowing men. And ſo accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this interpretation, both or either of theſe ſenſitive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and both or either of their properties, are alike compared to wiſe and learned men, who are able not only to underſtand the ſound of words, but alſo exerciſe a judgement upon them, both to diſcerne and determine what there is of truth and right in them.<note place="margin">Sapientia eſt ſapida ſcientia.</note> Hence that ſaying of the Ancient, <hi>Wiſdome is a ſavory knowledge.</hi> Wiſe men taſt and ſavour the things which they know. He ſurely was a wiſe man who ſayd of the word of God (<hi>Jer:</hi> 15.16.) <hi>Thy words were ſound, and I did eate them, and thy word was to me the joy and rejoycing of my heart. Heare, O ye wiſe men, and give ear to me ye that have knowledge; the ear tryeth words, as the mouth taſteth meat;</hi> that is, as the ear of a man tryeth words, and as the mouth of a man doth taſt meat; ſo wiſe and knowing men try and taſt that which is ſpoken and heard. Thus both theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive faculties, their properties and powers are compared to wiſe men, who doe not only heare the voyce of him that ſpeaketh, but ſit downe to conſider it. The mouth having taken meat and
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:104248:261"/> chawed it, taſts it, and makes a judgement of it; Thus wiſe men deal with all they hear; ſo that, look what theſe two natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties doe with naturall things; with words naturally ſpoken, with meat naturally eaten; the ſame, they who are wiſe and knowing do to what is ſpoken ſpiritually and rationally, they try and judge it.</p>
                  <p>But I conceive, we need not inſiſt ſtrictly upon this; For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we compare theſe two ſenſes in their ſeverall operations to wiſe men, or whether we compare them in their operations one with another, yet (according to the ſenſe of our tranſlation) the meaning of <hi>Elihu</hi> is the ſame, namely, that thoſe wiſe men to whom he ſpake, ſhould not only hear but try what they heard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had received a power ſo to do; <hi>for the ear tryeth words, even at the mouth taſteth meat.</hi>
                  </p>

It tryeth them alſo as to their gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall ſenſe, or the conſtruction of what is ſpoken in the letter: The inward eare or underſtanding tryeth them as to their logicall ſenſe, ſcope and tendency, as to their uſe, and force in the matter they are ſpoken to. Both wayes <hi>the eare tryeth words, as the mouth taſteth meate;</hi> only with this difference, that the tryall which the mouth makes is meerly ſenſitive, and both begun and perfected in the mouth; but the tryall which the ear makes is chiefly intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall, it is begun at the ear, but perfected by the underſtanding. It is the mind which judgeth, the eare only brings in the report of things to the mind.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſenſe of hearing is a great mercy, and of great uſe to mankind.</q>
                  <p>The eare is the chiefe Gate or inlet to the ſoul;<note place="margin">Aurem audien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem dicit audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem verbi o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedientem. <hi>Beda.</hi>
                     </note> nor were our eares given only for an Ornament to the head, but for the enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bettering of the heart. The naturally rationall eare given to heare and try words is a mercy; but when a ſpiritually ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ear is given with it to heare and try words, that's a mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith (<hi>Prov.</hi> 20.12.) <hi>The hearing eare, and the ſeeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them.</hi> Theſe naturall ſenſes are of Gods own creation, and the uſe of them his bleſſing,
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:104248:262"/> yet common to all mankind good and bad; but the ſpirituall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſeeing and hearing, are a ſpeciall priviledge promiſed to the elect, and a fruit of Goſpel grace. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.5.) <hi>Then the eyes of the blind ſhall be opened, and the eares of the deafe ſhall be unſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</hi> He meaneth it not either only or chiefly of the bodily eyes and eares (though Chriſt wrought miracles upon them, and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both the blind and deafe in the dayes of his fleſh) but of the eyes and eares of the ſoul, which are often darke and ſtopt while the other are free enough in the exerciſe of their ſeverall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The ſeeing eye, which both <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> intend, is the eye which ſo ſeeth as that it followeth the good which it ſeeth; and that's their hearing eare which beleeveth and obeyeth what it heareth. A ſuperficiall ſeeing eye is a blind eye, and a formall hearing eare is a deafe eare in the ſight and account of God. We ſay it is the ſymptome of ſome diſtemper or growing diſeaſe upon the body, when the pallate doth not relliſh meate; Surely it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth a diſeaſed and ſick ſoul, when we have no mind to heare nor find relliſh in the word of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>Words are not to be received nor ſubmitted to, nor beleeved as true, till they are tryed.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Itching eares are bad,</hi> (2 Tim. 4.3.) <hi>Trying eares are good.</hi> You will not ſwallow your meat till you have chewed and taſted it; nor ſhould you ſwallow words, till you have tryed them; why elſe have we eares to heare? why are we truſted with reaſon to judge things with? or with rules to judge them by? There is no greater Tyranny in the World, then to command a man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve (by an implicit faith) as others beleeve; or to impoſe our opinions and aſſertions upon thoſe that hear them, and not to give them liberty to try them. This is to be at once (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>James</hi> expreſſeth it, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 3.1.) <hi>many Maſters,</hi> or many Maſters where we ſhould not be one.</p>
                  <p>But ſome will ſay, when the Word of God is preached, is that to be tryed by men? have we a liberty to take that into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or to take and refuſe it as we are perſwaded in our own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, The word of God is not to be brought to the barre nor to be tryed by man. The word of God is our Judge, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:104248:262"/> ought not to be judged by us; the word of God is perfect, and how can we that are imperfect judge that which is perfect. The word of God is truth, and all men are lyars; we are not therefore to judge the word of God, nor try that: Yet when any man ſpeaks of or from the word of God, we are to try what he ſpeakes; that is, whether what he ſpeaks be according to the word of God, and his doctrine or interpretation grounded on the Text. Every one that ſpeakes about ſpirituall things profeſſeth he brings the word of God, and it muſt be tryed whether he doth ſo or no. It is a truth to which all are to ſubmit (without diſpute) by beleeving that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, to waſh away their ſins with his blood.</hi> This is the word of God: yet when this truth is Preached, we may conſider whether it be mannaged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word of God or no. This great doctrine, which containes the ſumme of the Goſpel, may have ſuch things mingled with it, as are not to be received for the word of God. Some in the primitive time thought and taught that there was no ſalvation by Chriſt unleſſe they ſtill kept the ceremoniall Law and were circumciſed; though they held that fundamentall truth, that Chriſt dyed to ſave ſinners; yet when they came to the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, they deſtroyed it by urging a neceſſity of continuing the ceremoniall Law: whereas others judged rightly that faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without the uſe of any Jewiſh ceremony, purifieth the heart. Therefore a counſell of ſpirituall and godly wiſe men was called <hi>to conſider of this matter. (Acts</hi> 15.6.) What to doe? not to try the Word of God, but to try which of thoſe two different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions was according to the Word of God. Thus when we hear a Sermon, though the Word of God and Chriſt crucified be the generall ſubject of it, and that is not to be tryed, but received by faith and obeyed; yet what is ſpoken upon it and delivered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it as the mind of God in the Scripture, that is to be tryed. (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15.) <hi>He that is ſpirituall, tryeth, or judgeth all things.</hi> And againe (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.29.) the Apoſtle gives this counſell about propheſying, <hi>Let one or two ſpeak, and let the others judge;</hi> what? the Word of God, no! but whether they ſpeake accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the word of God, or no; In this ſenſe every one muſt judg ſor himſelfe, we muſt not take all for granted, but try what we heare by the eare, as we doe what we eat by the mouth.</p>
                  <pb n="504" facs="tcp:104248:263"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>A ſpiritually judicious and conſiderate man will take time to judge of things that are ſpoken, as the pallate doth of meates that are eaten.</q>
                  <p>The eare tryeth words as the mouth taſteth meat; God hath given man a faculty for that end, and he is to uſe his faculty. We commonly fay, <hi>Look before you leape.</hi> Surely then we ſhould taſt before we eate, and prove all things whether they are good or no, before we (electively) hold that which is good. (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21.) <hi>The noble Bereans received the word with all readineſſe of mind;</hi> yet they would make no more haſt then good ſpeed to receive it, for (as the Text ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11.) <hi>They ſearched the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures dayly whether thoſe things were ſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Here are two Organs of ſenſe ſpoken of, <hi>the ear</hi> and <hi>the mouth,</hi> both are of great uſe to man, but one of them, <hi>the eare</hi> is of a more frequent and noble uſe. Beaſts have both mouths and eares; but becauſe theirs is only a ſenſitive life, they make more uſe of their mouths then of their eares. Whereas man whoſe life is rationall, yea and ſpirituall too, muſt or ought to make more uſe of his eares then of his mouth.</p>
                  <p>How doth this reprove all thoſe who are more in trying meats, then in trying words? or more for taſting, then they are for hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? It was a complaint of ſome in the former age, that they made themſelves like bruit beaſts, which having both thoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of hearing and taſting, have yet no regard to hearing, but are all for feeding and eating. They carry it like beaſts, and are more bruitiſh then a beaſt, who employ their mouths more then their eares. A beaſt is made in that low forme, to live to eat, and worke, and ſo to dye; man is of a higher forme, next to that of Angells, and for him to ſpend his time in eating and drinking, as if his worke lay at his mouth, not at his ear, is to degrade himſelf and lead a bruitiſh life. The Apoſtle brings in ſuch bruits ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.32.) <hi>Let us eat and drink for to morrow we ſhall dye;</hi> not a word of uſing their eares: they ſay not, come let us hear the word of God, let us ſeek bread for our ſoules, but come, let us eat and drink; now for a man to be ſo much in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as to neglect hearing and meditating, what doth he but make himſelfe like a beaſt of the earth, who ſhould be like the
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:104248:263"/> Angels in Heaven, dayly riſing up to a ſpirituall and heavenly life; God lifts us up to Heaven (as I may ſay) <hi>by the eares.</hi> Our eares were not given us only to heare delightfull ſounds, or to commune one with another about the affaires of this life; the uſe of the eare is yet more noble, even to helpe us in the receiving of all ſaving and ſanctifying knowledge. <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> (Rom. 15.17.) and ſo doth every grace, both as to the implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and growth of it, till we come to glory. Therefore conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how you uſe this excellent ſenſe of hearing, and how you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in ſpirituals by what you have heard. We were made after the Image of God in knowledge and righteouſneſſe, and it ſhould be the great deſigne of our lives to get this image renewed; and that is done at the eare, 'tis wrought by hearing; faith, repentance, and every grace come in and are wrought at the eare. Some ſcoffe at this latter age, calling it <hi>a hearing age, not a working age;</hi> we (ſay they) are much for <hi>ear-work,</hi> little for <hi>hand-work;</hi> all for Preaching, nothing for doing; nor can this reproach be quite wiped off, ſeeing with our plenty of Preaching, there is ſo little practiſing; as if men had turned all the members of their body into eares, and were nothing but hearing: To doe nothing but heare, or to heare and doe nothing, to heare much and act little, is a high provocation. To have a ſwel'd head and a feeble hand is the diſeaſe of Religion. Yet let not voluptuous Epicures who are all for the palate and belly-cheere think to excuſe themſelves, for not hearing, or for ſeldome hearing, becauſe ſome who hear much are found doing little, or ſeldome do what they hear: for as theſe ſhall be condemned by the word which they have heard and not done, ſo ſhall theſe for not hearing the word which would have ſhewed them what to doe. It hath been anciently ſaid, <hi>The belly hath no eares,</hi> nor will they either mind hearing, or mind what they hear, who mind their bellyes (not for hunger and the ſupport of nature, that is (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.17.) for ſtrength but) for drunkenneſſe or ſurfet.<note place="margin">Cum eo vivere non poſſum cui palatum magis ſapiat quam cor. <hi>Plutar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus in vita Catonis.</hi>
                     </note> When a voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon deſired <hi>Cato</hi> that he might live with him: No, ſaid <hi>Cato,</hi> I like not your ſociety, I doe not love to converſe with a man who uſeth his mouth more then his eares; who is buſied more to pleaſe his taſt in eating and drinking, then to enrich his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by hearing and diſcourſing. The Apoſtle (<hi>Tit.</hi> 1.12. referring them to one of their own Poets) calleth the <hi>Cretians
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:104248:264"/> evill beaſts, ſlow bellies.</hi> They were not ſlow to fill their bellyes, but their full bellyes (their <hi>belly being their God,</hi> as he told ſome among the <hi>Philippians,</hi> Chap. 3.19.) made them ſlow, yea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate to every good word and worke. <hi>Solomon</hi> gives man a great charge when he ſaith (<hi>Prov.</hi> 23.23.) <hi>Buy truth, and ſell it not.</hi> The mart for thoſe moſt precious commodities grace and truth, is kept (not at the belly, but) at the eare; there we buy <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money, and without price</hi> both grace and truth; to get theſe is to be wiſe merchants. The beſt market we can make, the beſt trade we can drive is with and at our eares: <hi>The eare tryeth words, as the mouth taſteth meat.</hi> And from this <hi>Elihu</hi> infers</p>

The reaſon of man is able to put a difference not only between wheat and tares, but if you bring him ſeverall ſamples of wheat, or other graine, he is able to judge which is the better, which is beſt; a knowing man will judge to two pence in a buſhell which is beſt; ſo in all other commodities we not only judge between that which is good, and that which is ſtark nought, but when we have many parcels and particulars of any kinde before us good and uſefull, we judge which is the beſt, which the principall.</p>
                  <p>Thus in ſpiritualls, we are not only to judge of things ſo farre as to know good from evill (which yet is a very good piece of knowledge; for many put <hi>darkneſs for light, and light for dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter,</hi> as the Prophet complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 5.20.) that is, they huddle all things together in a Chaos of confuſion) but it ſhould be our care to know good from good, yea to know what excells among things that are excellent. 'Tis well when we know truth from falſhood, but we ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to know which among truths is the moſt precious truth. <hi>Paul</hi> having ſpoken of what was good, yea of the beſt gifts, ſaith, <hi>Yet I will ſhew you a more excellent way</hi> (1 Cor: 12.31.) As if he had ſayd ſayd, This is a good way you are in, the exerciſe of the beſt gifts, but here's a more excellent way, the exerciſe of grace. Thus here I take good, not ſo much Poſitively as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, <hi>Let us know what is good,</hi> that is, what is beſt, and what is beſt of all.</p>
                  <q>Let us chuſe to our ſelves Judgement: and know among our ſelves that which is good.</q>
                  <p>Firſt, In that he ſaith, <hi>Let us chuſe to our ſelves Judgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>We muſt conſider deliberately and maturely before we paſs Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
                  <pb n="509" facs="tcp:104248:265"/>
                  <p>Judgement is a choice thing, and muſt be made upon choyce; it is not to be ſnatched up haſtily, but duely choſen. They that are upon the choyce either of things or perſons, ſhould be much in Conſideration. How uncomely (beſides unrighteous) is it, to judge men or matters raſhly, to be hurried on to election with paſſion, or to judge upon heare-ſayes and Conjectures? This is not to chuſe Judgement, but to ſnatch it up; to chuſe Judgement is to doe it with mature deliberation; there muſt be much weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, elſe properly no judging; raſh judgement is uſually wrong judgement; and that layeth us open to another judgement, <hi>Judge not that ye be not judged,</hi> is Chriſts warning (<hi>Math:</hi> 7.1.) that is, doe not judge haſtily, or harſhly, doe not judge raſhly nor rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, much leſſe falſely, for if you do you ſhall be judged righteou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>y (indeed) as to your caſe, but not comfortably as to your conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They who will not chuſe Judgement, doe, in the iſſue, chuſe Judgement, that is, not uſing deliberation in Judgement, they draw deſervedly upon themſelves a judgement of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Taking it more generally, <hi>Let us chuſe to our ſelves Judgement,</hi> or that which is right.</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>It is not enough for us to doe Judgement, or that which is right, but we muſt chuſe it.</q>
                  <p>'Tis a worke of no acceptation with God to doe that which is juſt, unleſſe we chuſe it as wel as doe it, that is, unleſſe our hearts cloſe with it, and pitch upon it. <hi>Solomon</hi> (Prov: 1.29.) chargeth the ſimple for not chuſing what was good; <hi>they did not chuſe the feare of the Lord.</hi> By the feare of the Lord, he meanes the true worſhip of the Lord, or any worke of obedience, by which we teſtifie a holy feare of him; poſſibly they might doe the feare of the Lord; poſſibly they worſhipped the Lord, they prayed to him, and heard his word, but they did not chuſe the feare of the Lord; they did not ſit downe and judge that beſt, or moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but tooke it up by accident, or by cuſtome, or for company, becauſe they ſaw others doe it. It will not turne to our account to be found doing good, unleſſe we chuſe to our ſelves that which is good. <hi>Our elections are more eyed by God, then our actions, and the ſetting of our hearts, then the work of our hands.</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, From the latter branch, <hi>Let us know among our ſelves what is good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> There's nothing worth our knowing, but that which is good.</q>
                  <p>Whatſoever hath a morall, or a ſpirituall good in it, is worthy to be knowne; the truths, the workes, the wayes of God, are the moſt deſireable good things to be ſtudied and knowne (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 4.6.) <hi>There are many will ſay, who will ſhew us any good?</hi> What's their good? Corne, wine, oyle, gold, ſilver, houſes, lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe are their good, and theſe are all their good; but though a godly man knoweth that theſe are good things, and bleſſeth God for any portion in them; yet that which he call's <hi>his good, and the good,</hi> is of a higher nature; We commonly call worldly things <hi>our goods,</hi> but we miſ-call them if we call them <hi>our good.</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God is our good, grace is our good, faith and love and hope and righteouſneſſe are good above all, God himſelfe is good, and to know and enjoy him in Chriſt through the Spirit is our chiefeſt good here, and will be all our good hereafter. <hi>Let us know what is good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the Comparative ſenſe of the words, <hi>Let us know what is good,</hi> that is, if there be a better to be had let us know that.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>It is not enough for us to have the knowledge of good things, but among good things the best are to be ſought out, to be knowne, and attained to.</q>
                  <p>This was a ſpeciall branch of the Apoſtles prayer for the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> (Phil: 1.10.) <hi>That ye may approve the things that are excellent;</hi> or the things that differ in excellency; Some are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſit downe in the loweſt forme of Chriſts Schoole; if they have but any thing which they may call good, or true, right and ſincere, they looke no further; any thing ſatisfieth them, which will ſerve turne to keep them from periſhing; they have no holy aſpirings, nor godly covetous deſires after the beſt things, and the beſt of the beſt. God is willing and hath promiſed to give us not only good things, but the beſt things (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 81.16.) <hi>He ſhould have fed them alſo with the fineſt of the wheat,</hi>
                     <pb n="511" facs="tcp:104248:266"/> and <hi>with honey out of the rock ſhould I have ſatisfied thee;</hi> 'tis a mercy to have wheat, but the fineſt of the wheat, and honey out of the rock, not ordinary honey, but the beſt honey, the pureſt honey, are greater mercies. We, by our ſins, deſerve that <hi>God ſhould</hi> (as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 30.20.) <hi>give us the bread of adverſity, and the water of affliction;</hi> that is, either that he ſhould give us adverſity in ſtead of bread, and affliction in ſtead of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or that he ſhould feed us with the courſeſt bread, with huskes and bran, and give us bitter waters, the waters of <hi>Marah</hi> to drinke, yet he in mercy gives us pleaſant bread, and wel-taſted water; yea were we better, he would give us the beſt bread, the fineſt of the wheat, and our cup ſhould be ſweeter to us then the ſweeteſt honey. <hi>The reaſon why we have not of the beſt, is becauſe we are no better.</hi> Yea God now gives us not only good things, but the beſt of good things, even himſelfe, his Son and Spirit, who are beſt of all (O how excellent is this loving kindneſs!) therefore let us not only look after good things, but the beſt of good things, to honour God, and lift up his name to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in this world; Let us labour to know and doe the beſt things; and give God our beſt ſervices and pureſt praiſes, even the male of our flocke, the firſt-borne, the ſtrength of our whole ſoules. To theſe higheſt attainments, <hi>Elihu</hi> perſwades thoſe wiſe and knowing men, promiſing to joyne with them in that ſearch; Come let us beat out the buſineſs with diligence, that we may at laſt chuſe Judgement, and know among our ſelves what is good, what is beſt.</p>

                  <p>That's the firſt charge, <hi>Job hath ſaid; Elihu</hi> gathers up, and collects thoſe paſſages of <hi>Jobs</hi> complaint, which he found moſt faulty, and layeth them (as we ſay) in his diſh; <hi>Job hath ſaid;</hi> we may well remember, and he cannot deny it, for he hath ſaid it, not once only, but often, not lightly, but ſeriouſly and aſſertingly, <hi>I am juſt, or righteous;</hi> that is, <hi>I have ſufficiently ſhewed my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and the equity of my cauſe, but I am not permitted to declare

                  <p>But it may be queſtioned, where ſaid he this?</p>
                  <p>For anſwer, I ſhall doe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Shew from what paſſages in <hi>Jobs</hi> former anſwers this charge may be made good, or at leaſt made up.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſhall ſhew in what ſence <hi>Job</hi> ſaid this, and how <hi>Elihu</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> doe either agree, or differ in the thing.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt, where ſaid <hi>Job, I am righteous?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer; We find not this direct aſſertion in termes, or in ſo many words, but what he ſpake in ſeverall places amounts to it; (<hi>Chap:</hi> 13.18.) <hi>Behold, now I have ordered my cauſe, I know I ſhall be juſtified,</hi> (Chap: 23.10.) <hi>But he knoweth the way that I take, when he hath tryed me, I ſhall come forth as gold.</hi> (Chap: 27.6.) <hi>My righteouſneſs I hold faſt, and will not let it goe;</hi> and he inſiſted at large upon this poynt, his vindication from all unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs throughout the whole 31th Chapter. There we find him making frequent imprecations (<hi>v.</hi> 5, 6, 7.) <hi>If I have wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with vanitie, or if my foot hath haſted to deceit; Let me be weighed in an even ballance, that God may know mine integrity; If my ſtep hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands, then</hi> &amp;c. In all which and many other paſſages of that Chapter, <hi>Job</hi> ſpake highly of his owne innocency, and ſaid in effect, <hi>I am righteous.</hi> His other friends had taken notice of this before; <hi>Eliphaz</hi> hit him with it (<hi>Chap:</hi> 4.17.) while he put thoſe queſtions; <hi>Shall mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man be more juſt then God? ſhall a man be more pure then his maker?</hi> And ſo did <hi>Bildad</hi> (Chap: 8.6.) <hi>If thou wert pure and upright, ſurely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy righteouſneſs proſperous.</hi> Nor was <hi>Zophar</hi> behind with him (<hi>Chap:</hi> 11.4.) <hi>Thou haſt ſayd, my doctrine is pure, I am cleane in thine eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="514" facs="tcp:104248:268"/>
                  <p>Secondly, In what ſence did he ſpeak this? For anſwer, when <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am righteous,</hi> we muſt conſider a two-fold righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Firſt, a perfect abſolute righteouſneſs, and that may be two-fold; Firſt, the righteouſneſs of juſtification, which is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſs; Secondly, the righteouſneſs of ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is an in-wrought or inherent righteouſneſs; this latter is not abſolute, or perfect in degree, while we abide in this life, yet it is dayly growing up to perfection, and ſhall at laſt attaine a perfect growth. If any ſay; Why then doth God call us to a perfection of ſanctification in this life, if it be not attainable in this life? I anſwer, he doth it, firſt, to ſhew how holy he is; Secondly, to ſhew how holy we ought to be; Thirdly, he doth it, that we might run to Chriſt, <hi>who is the Lord our righteouſneſs; and who is made unto us of God, wiſdome, righteouſneſs, ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and redemption:</hi> we being altogether ſhort of righteouſneſs, and ſhort in righteouſneſs, may goe to him, and have a compleat and perfect righteouſneſs. Now beſides this abſolute righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of juſtification, which is attainable here, and of ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is not attainable here, but ſhall be hereafter, there is a comparatively perfect righteouſneſs of ſanctification, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of uprightneſs, and ſincerity, when we ſtrive to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt to pleaſe God in all things by doing good, and can ſay, we doe not pleaſe our ſelves in any way of doing evill.</p>
                  <p>It ſhould ſeeme that <hi>Elihu</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> did not wel agree about the definition of juſtice or righteouſneſs. <hi>Job</hi> intending either civill righteouſneſs towards men, or a righteouſneſs imputed free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by God; but <hi>Elihu</hi> underſtood him of abſolute perfect perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all righteouſneſs, which no man attaines unto in this life. For when <hi>Job</hi> is charged with ſaying,<note place="margin">Intelligitur ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia per fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem mediatoris ſpiritus ſancti Arrabone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmata; Ne<expan>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>I am righteous,</hi> he ſaid it either as a juſtified perſon, or as a ſanctified perſon. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſence, he might ſay he was perfectly righteous, and in the latter he ſayd he was ſo, as to the ſincerity and uprightneſs of his heart with God, and this he might ſay of himſelfe without fault or blame; for God himſelfe had ſayd of him (<hi>Ch:</hi> 1.1.) that he <hi>was a man perfect, and upright.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I grant <hi>Job</hi> ſeemes to ſay, (though he ſaid it not, with that aime or intention, yet he ſeemes to ſay) that he was even abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely righteous, not only as juſtified but ſanctified, while he ſaid, (<hi>Chap:</hi> 31.7, 8.) <hi>If there be any blot cleaving to my hands, if my
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:104248:268"/> ſteps have gone out of the way, or my heart been deceived,</hi> &amp;c. This gave <hi>Elihu</hi> occaſion to charge him, with ſaying, <hi>I am righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;</hi> he did not charge him with ſaying ſo, as juſtified through the free grace of God, nor did he charge him for ſaying ſo as to his ſincerity, but he charged him in theſe two reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe he ſpake ſo much of the righteouſneſs of his way, and of his workes; for though it were true he was righteous in the ſence by him intended, yet becauſe he made it his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſpent a large diſcourſe to tell the world, how good, how juſt, and how holy a man he had been, this was more then became him in that condition.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Elihu</hi> checkt him for ſaying ſo, becauſe (though he were fully righteous as juſtified and ſincerely righteous as ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) he complained of his afflictions, as if God might not lay his hand heavy upon him, no nor touch a righteous perſon with an afflicting hand; or as if he and all other righteous perſons, ought to paſſe all their dayes in peace, and have an exemption from the croſſe. Whereas one great reaſon why God afflicted him ſo ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was to make it knowne to all the world in his example, that meerely upon his owne prerogative and ſoveraignty, he both may and will when he pleaſeth, afflict the moſt innocent perſon in the world. Yea, the intent of <hi>Elihu</hi> in urging and burdening <hi>Job</hi> with thoſe ſayings, was to convince him, that though he was a child of God, and had walked before him in righteouſneſſe and true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, yet he ought to humble himſelfe and beare with meekneſs and patience the foreſt viſitations of God. And that therefore he ſhould not have pleaded his owne integrity, to priviledge him from affliction, nor have ſayd, <hi>Why doe I ſuffer, ſeeing I am righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous?</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That, as it is altogether ſinfull for any man to ſay, I am altogether without ſin;</hi> (for 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8.) <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, there is no truth in us;</hi> and he who ſaith (in that ſenſe) <hi>I am righteous,</hi> doth but declare his owne unrighteouſneſs) ſo to ſpeake <hi>much of our owne righteouſneſs and goodneſs</hi> (though we are both good and righteous) <hi>is evill and very blameable.</hi> For whereas <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am righteous,</hi> he ſhould rather have left others to ſay it, he ſhould have been ſatisfied that he was ſo without ſaying ſo; and though it cannot be denied that <hi>Job</hi> was extreamly urged to
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:104248:269"/> it (as hath been ſhewed more then once in opening this Booke) and it had been but neceſſary for him to ſay it once or twice in his owne defence, yet becauſe he ſayd it ſo often, it drew, and that deſervedly, this cenſure or charge upon him.</p>
                  <p>Hence take this corolary or inference.</p>
                  <q>If to ſpeake much of our owne righteouſneſs be diſpleaſing, then how abominable is it to be proud of it or truſt upon it?</q>
                  <p>There is nothing more pleaſing to God, then to ſee man walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in wayes of righteouſneſs, nor is there any thing more diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto God, then to ſee a man lifted up with or leaning upon his owne righteouſneſs. If we make our owne righteouſneſs our ſtaffe, God will make it our rod. And though he is farre from ſcourging us becauſe we are righteous, yet he will correct us if we proclaime our owne righteouſneſs, yea if we thinke it much, or thinke much of it. We muſt have a very great occaſion when at any time we beare witneſs to our owne righteouſneſs, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but if the heart be lifted up in pride, or truſt, at all, upon it, this renders man odious in the ſight of God. God ſaved <hi>Noah</hi> out of that common deluge, in which the old world periſhed; <hi>For</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Gen:</hi> 7.1.) <hi>thee have I ſeene righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me in this generation. Noah</hi> was righteous before God, and was ſaved when others periſhed; but ſurely had he vainely boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted or unneceſſarily voted himſelfe righteous before men, he had periſhed as wel as others. It comes much to one and the ſame account with God, whether men be openly unrighteous, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (without a juſt cauſe and call) they open their righteouſneſs before men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>How righteous ſoever we are in life, yea though we are righteous by faith, <hi>(which is our righteouſneſs unto life)</hi> yet we muſt not plead that for our freedome from afflictions.</q>
                  <p>We may plead the righteouſneſs of faith againſt condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but not againſt correction; if any man be in Chriſt, he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be condemned; but though a man be in Chriſt, and juſtified by the higheſt actings of faith in the blood of the Covenant, yet he may be ſeverely corrected. This was (I conceive) the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ſcope and intent of <hi>Elihu</hi> in charging <hi>Job</hi> thus, even to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:104248:269"/> him, that though he was a faithfull ſervant of God, and of a very unſtained converſation among men, yet he muſt not thinke himſelfe above the croſſe, but quietly and meekly ſubmit to it. <hi>Job</hi> ſpake ſometimes fully to that poynt, <hi>He deſtroyeth the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the wicked, if the ſcourge ſlay ſuddenly, he laugheth at the tryall of the innocent</hi> (Chap: 9.23.) yet at other times he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got himſelfe, and therefore he was (juſtly as to his preſent caſe, and profitably as to the future iſſue) remembred of it by this plaine and home-dealer <hi>Elihu. Job hath ſaid I am righteous,</hi>
                     <q>And God hath taken away my Judgement.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As if he had ſayd, Once thou didſt ſay, <hi>God deſtroyeth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and the wicked,</hi> but now thou ſeemeſt to ſay, thou art greatly wrong'd, and thy Judgement quite taken away, becauſe being a righteous man thou art thus afflicted.</p>
                  <p>Mr <hi>Broughton</hi> renders, <hi>But the Omnipotent keeps back my right.</hi> As Judgement is right fully given, ſo there is but little difference between keeping back our right, and <hi>taking it away;</hi>

This is the thing (ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi>) which <hi>Job</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>God hath taken away or kept back my Judgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But where did <hi>Job</hi> ſay this? he ſaid it (<hi>Chap:</hi> 27.2.) <hi>As the Lord liveth, who hath taken away my Judgement, and the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who hath vexed my ſoule. Bildad</hi> charged <hi>Job</hi> with it (<hi>Chap:</hi> 8. 3.) while he put this queſtion to him, <hi>Doth God pervert Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? or the Almighty pervert Juſtice?</hi> Implying that <hi>Job</hi> had ſpoken words reflecting upon the Juſtice and Judgement of God, in taking away his Judgement.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, What is Judgement? and what is it to <hi>take away Judgement?</hi> or how is a mans <hi>Judgement taken away?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer; There is a three-fold notion of Judgement in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Judgement is the reſult or iſſue of a mans reaſon about any matter or queſtion propounded to him. God ſometimes takes away mans Judgement in that ſenſe, and then he becomes a foole, and unable to judge. 'Tis a dreadfull judgement when God thus takes away mans judgement, and gives him up to a <hi>Reprobate</hi>
                     <pb n="518" facs="tcp:104248:270"/> (or an unjudicious) <hi>minde,</hi> as he did the old Gentiles (<hi>Rom:</hi> 1.28.) for then he will quickly doe thoſe things <hi>which are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient;</hi> not being able to diſtinguiſh nor diſcerne between true or falſe, he muſt needs put light for darkneſs, bitter for ſweet, ſweet for bitter; <hi>Elihu</hi> doth not repreſent <hi>Job</hi> complaining that God had taken away his judgement in this notion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Judgement is any angry diſpenſation or wrath powred out or executed upon perſons, nations, or Churches; <hi>If judgement begin at the houſe of God,</hi> (that is, if trouble or wrath begin at the Church of God) <hi>what will the end of thoſe be that obey not the Goſpel?</hi> (1 Pet: 4.17.) <hi>Davids</hi> Song conſiſted of two parts (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 101.1.) judgement was one of them, <hi>I will ſing of mercy and judgement.</hi> This notion of judgement is every where found in Scripture, yet neither is this the notion of it in this Scripture. God had not thus taken away <hi>Jobs</hi> judgement; he begg'd indeed that God would take away this his judgement, and it was the matter of his complaint, becauſe he did not take it away.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Judgement is right done or right due; right due, is judgement due; right done, is judgement done. Thus <hi>David</hi> prayed (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 72.1.) <hi>Give the King thy Judgements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O God, and thy righteouſneſs to the Kings ſon;</hi> that is, give him an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to doe right, or to give every man his right. To doe this is a thing ſo deſireable in all men, eſpecially in Kings and Princes, that when God at <hi>Gibeon</hi> ſent young king <hi>Solomon</hi> a blanke from heaven, and bid him aske what he would, he asked only this (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.9.) <hi>Give thy ſervant an underſtanding heart, to judge thy people, that I may diſcerne between good and bad.</hi> This is properly the judgement intended here. <hi>Job</hi> complained, <hi>God hath taken away my Judgement;</hi> that is, my right, or hath not done me right.</p>
                  <p>But how is Judgement taken away?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall anſwer it in three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When right is quite ſubverted, and over-throwne. This the Prophet elegantly expreſſeth and reproveth (<hi>Amos</hi> 6.12.) <hi>Ye have turned judgement into gall, and the fruit of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs into Hemlock.</hi> Right done is ſweete and wholeſome, but right denied is bitter as Gall, and banefull like Hemlock.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When Judgement is defer'd, ſtopped, or delayed,
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:104248:270"/> then 'tis taken away for a time. To have judgement long delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is alwayes next degree to the deniall of it, and ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay is more cruciating and grievous then a deniall.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A mans judgement is ſayd to be taken away, when the ground, or cauſe, of Gods proceeding with him in judgement, is hid, or unmanifeſt; Judgement, as to us, is not, when the reaſon of it doth not appeare to us, or when we ſee not the reaſon of it. To feel Judgement and not to ſee the cauſe of it, turnes it into a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; we ſay commonly, <hi>Things that appeare not, are as if they were not.</hi> When the reaſon or ground of our ſufferings is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, 'tis as if we ſuffered without any ground of reaſon.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Job</hi> complained, <hi>God hath taken away my Judgement,</hi> we are not to underſtand him, as if <hi>Elihu</hi> intended it in the firſt or groſſeſt ſence, that God had ſubverted his judgement, or had done him wrong. <hi>Elihu</hi> could not ſuſpect he had any ſuch blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous opinion of God; for, that had fullfilled the Devills pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of him, <hi>He will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> But when he ſayd, <hi>God hath taken away my Judgement;</hi> he meant it according to the two latter interpretations, either that God deferred long to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him, and anſwer his prayer, or that God had hid from him the reaſon of his dealing with him, ſo that he could not make it out, how, or why he was ſo ſorely and grievouſly handled. <hi>Job</hi> knew well his owne innocency, but he did not well conſider Gods ſoveraignty, which alone anſwers enough for him, how much ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he in this world afflicts the innocent. And therefore for as much as God held him long in that ſad condition, and in the meane time hid his judgement, or the reaſon of it from him, this was <hi>Jobs</hi> grievance, and the burden of it preſſed him to cry out, <hi>God hath taken away my Judgement.</hi> In this he was too bold with God, and therefore he juſtly fell under this cenſure of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu:</hi> As if he had ſayd, It doth not at all become thee, O <hi>Job,</hi> as a creature, as a man, much leſſe as a new creature, or as a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, to cry out (as thou haſt done) that God hath taken away thy Judgement; becauſe he doth not give thee an account, nor tell thee, why he judgeth thee; therefore humble thy ſelfe that ever thou haſt ſayd (and take heed thou ſay it no more) <hi>God hath taken away my Judgement.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>The Lord ſometimes is pleaſed to defer and delay to doe his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants right.</q>
                  <p>And thus he takes away their Judgement. Though he hath a purpoſe to give it them, yet he doth not preſently give it them; at laſt he will make even with all men, each man ſhall have his judgement; he will reward every one according to his worke, and the righteous, ſhall (without doubt) have a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>When God doth either hide or defer the Judgement of a godly man, it doth very much affect, yea and afflict his heart.</q>
                  <p>We are uſually much afflicted with any dark diſpenſation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many accounts, eſpecially upon this, becauſe it makes us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to every mans cenſure. When God takes away our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we fall under the hard judgements of men; And to lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ill opinions of men unvindicated or unrighted, is no eaſie burden. We have that promiſe (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 37.6.) <hi>He ſhall bring forth thy righteouſneſs as the light, and thy judgement as the noone-day.</hi> The righteouſneſs and judgement of a good man may be in a mid-night darkneſs as to man, and till that be brought to the light of other mens knowledge, himſelfe hath, ſometimes, little light of comfort.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Note.</p>
                  <q>It is ſinfull to complaine, and to be troubled, as if God had not done us right, becauſe we ſee it not done, or becauſe he deferrs to doe it.</q>
                  <pb n="521" facs="tcp:104248:271"/>
                  <p>In this <hi>Job</hi> was moſt faulty, he uttered many paſſionate ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches about what God had done, becauſe things were not brought to an iſſue, nor his condition ſtated and cleared up, either to the world, or to himſelfe; This troubled him more then the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his paine, or the greateſt of his troubles. How ſtiffely <hi>Job</hi> ſtood upon it, that his Judgement was taken away, will appeare yet further in the next words, which <hi>Elihu</hi> makes further matter of accuſation.</p>

                  </p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> To acknowledge we have done that, which we have not done, or that we are what we are not, is to lie againſt our owne right, or to wrong our ſelves.</q>
                  <p>As many lie, by ſpeaking more good of themſelves then is true, or by denying that evill which in truth they are guilty of; ſo he that ſubmits to that guilt which he is free from, or confeſſeth more evill of himſelfe then is true, lieth againſt his owne ſoule. So did that <hi>Amalekite</hi> (2 Sam: 1.10. compared with 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 31.4.) charge himſelfe falſely with killing <hi>Saul</hi> in hope of a reward from <hi>David</hi> for his good newes. As no man ought to lie againſt another, much leſſe againſt himſelfe; And as that man doth wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly belie himſelfe, who ſaith he is better then he is, (for that's horrible hypocriſie; all ſuch God will unmask one time or other, who thus cover themſelves with lyes, and ſay (like thoſe in the Prophet) they have dreamed when they have ſeene nothing, but the vaine phanſies of their own braines, nor felt any thing but the preſumption of their falſe hearts; Now (I ſay) as he doth wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly bely himſelfe who ſaith he is better then he is) ſo for any man to deny that good which God hath done for him, or wrought in him, or what he hath done or wrought in the feare and power
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:104248:273"/> of God, is a dangerous way of denying and belying his owne right.</p>
                  <p>Hence ſecondly note.</p>
                  <q>No man ought to admit any charge againſt himſelfe, wherein he is not guilty.</q>
                  <p>It is not in our liberty to give up our owne integrity, we may not give up the righteouſneſs and innocency of others to a falſe witneſs, if we can detect it, much leſſe our owne. Let no man lie againſt his right. It is our affliction only to be wronged by others, but 'tis our ſin to wrong either others, or our ſelves. Yet</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>We may quickly over-act in ſtanding upon our own right.</q>
                  <p>That caution of <hi>Solomon (Eccl:</hi> 7.16.) ſeemes to carry this obſervation in it. <hi>Be not righteous overmuch, neither make thy ſelf over-wiſe: Why ſhouldſt thou deſtroy thy ſelfe.</hi> Some expound this precept as a rule of policy, adviſing all to a moderation in the practiſe of (that wherein there can be, indeed, no exceſſe) true piety and religion; as if it were a duty to ſtudy and comport our ſelves to a kind of neutrality and indifferency in the things of God, leſt we expoſe our ſelves to the wrath and rage of men, who cannot beare it with patience to ſee any that are better or do better then themſelves. But I conceive the Spirit of God in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> was farre from breathing any ſuch cold blaſt, to nip either the buddings or higheſt growths of godlineſſe; and that he would not at all abate any in the practiſe of holineſſe, but intends one of or all theſe three things. Firſt, to take men off from any opiniona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſſe, about what they judge to be righteous and themſelves righteous in doing it, willing them to take advice, and not to lean to their own underſtanding, nor to reſt in their own dictates as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; or Secondly, when he ſaith, <hi>Be not righteous overmuch,</hi> his meaning is, doe not exact the utmoſt of others which the Law in the rigour of it will allow; he that will not remit any thing of his right, is not only over-righteous, but may ſoon doe wrong; or Thirdly, when he ſaith, be not over-righteous, as he would not have men ſtand ſtrictly upon their right with others, ſo he would not have them ſpeak much of their own righteouſneſſe; but rather ſometimes take blame to themſelves, then (which was <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe)
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:104248:273"/> proclaime themſelves altogether blameleſſe. As we are not to betray our innocency, ſo not give a ſhadow of any boaſting in it. We ſeldome loſe by ſaying little of our ſelves. And in moſt caſes we ſhould rather truſt God (who hath promiſed he will doe it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.6.) <hi>to bring forth our righteouſneſſe as the light,</hi> then be over-induſtrious in bringing it to light, or in bringing it out of that darkneſſe with which it lyeth obſcured, either by or among men. As we ought never to lye againſt our right, ſo it may not be convenient at ſome times to ſpeake all the truth of it which we can. This at leaſt was <hi>Jobs</hi> fault, and it will be any mans who doth like <hi>Job,</hi> yea though he ſhould be (which few have been or are like to be) under as great ſufferings as <hi>Job.</hi> The greatneſſe whereof he aggravated to the hight in the next words, with which <hi>Elihu</hi> chargeth him.</p>
                  <q>My wound is incurable without tranſgreſſion.</q>
                  <p>An incurable wound is the worſt of wounds, and though to be wounded without tranſgreſſion is beſt for him that receives it, yet it is worſt for him that gives it. <hi>My wound is incurable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>my arrow;</hi> the arrow is a wounding weapon, and in this Text 'tis put for the wound it ſelf. <hi>Job</hi> complained (<hi>Chap.</hi> 6.4.) <hi>The arrows of the Allmighty drink up my ſpirits;</hi> There are arrows of two ſorts, and anſwerably there are wounds of two ſorts. There are firſt externall, ſecondly, internall arrows; God ſhooteth his arrows both into the fleſh, and ſpirit; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer make a wounded body, the latter a wounded ſoule. <hi>Job</hi> may intend both, for he received wounds in both; his fleſh was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and all that belong'd to fleſh, his eſtate, his credit and good name were wounded, his ſoule and ſpirit were wounded alſo, the arrowes of God were ſhot thick at him, and hit him from head to foot. <hi>The Archers</hi> (as dying <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid of <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 49.23,<note place="margin">Graviſſima eſt ſagitta mea abſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one. <hi>Bez:</hi>

And from this word man is called <hi>Enoſh</hi> in the Hebrew, to ſhew how infirme and fraile he is, ſin having given him a wound which is incurable, by any thing but the blood of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Job</hi> felt his wounds, and he ſpake of them, as a man ſwallowed up with deſperation, and expected no cure of his preſent ſad condition; <hi>My wound is incurable,</hi> and he concluded with that which is yet harder, <hi>My wound is incurable</hi>

We ow all our ſorrows to our ſins, all our woundings to our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſings. How then doth <hi>Job</hi> ſay, <hi>My wound is incurable without tranſgreſſion?</hi> The word here uſed is not uſually put to ſignifie ſin in generall (though ſome take it ſo) but ſome ſpeciall kind of ſin,<note place="margin">

                     </note> &amp; that of more then an ordinary degree, a ſin with a malignity, a provoking ſin; As if the meaning of <hi>Elihu</hi> were, that he heard <hi>Job</hi> ſay, Though his ſin were not great, though it were not any rebellion againſt light, nor dangerous Apoſtacy, though his were a very curable ſin, yet his wound was altogether incurable, his wound was great, though his ſin was little. Now, becauſe Juſtice doth uſually apportion the puniſhment inflicted both to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and meaſure of the ſin committed, therefore <hi>Elihu</hi> takes it (and he had too much occaſion to doe ſo) as a great reflection upon the juſtice of God, when he heard <hi>Job</hi> thus bemoaning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>My wound is incurable without tranſgreſſion.</hi> To receive the leaſt wound without tranſgreſſion, is a great wound to juſtice, how greatly then doth he wound the Juſtice of God, who ſaith he hath received a great, yea an incurable <hi>wound without tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But where ſpake <hi>Job</hi> theſe words, when ſaid he, <hi>My wound is incurable without tranſgreſſion,</hi> (we muſt bring in that, <hi>Job hath
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:104248:274"/> ſaid,</hi> to every one of theſe charges) I anſwer, <hi>Job</hi> ſpake of the arrows of God (<hi>Chap:</hi> 6.4.) and that they were incurable, he ſaith in other words (<hi>Chap:</hi> 16.13.) <hi>His arrowes compaſſe me round about; he cleaveth my reines aſunder; he powreth out my gall upon the ground.</hi> When a mans reines are cleft in ſunder with an arrow, and his gall powred on the ground, his wound is incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>But where did he ſay, <hi>My wound is incurable without tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; Elihu</hi> might collect that from (Chap: 9.17.) <hi>He break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me with a tempeſt, and multiplyeth my wounds without cauſe;</hi> and from (Chap: 16.16, 17.) <hi>My face is foule with weeping,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not for any injuſtice in my hands.</hi> While <hi>Mary</hi> waſhed the feete of Chriſt with her teares (<hi>Luke</hi> 7.38.) ſhe might be ſayd to foule her owne face with her teares. Teares, which (in a quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſence, or as a token of true repentance) waſh and cleanſe the ſoule, doe yet blubber and diſfigure the face. My face (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) is ſoule with weeping, though my hands are not foule with ſinning, or any evill doing. This was, in effect to ſay what <hi>Elihu</hi> here cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth him for ſaying, <hi>My wound is incurable without tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> God hath his arrows, he can wound us when and where he pleaſeth.</q>
                  <p>He ſhooteth and miſſeth not his marke. He hath a quiver full of deadly arrows; take heed how ye provoke him. <hi>Jbb</hi> had a whole quiver of arrows emptied upon him for triall, for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his patience. Woe to thoſe upon whom God emptieth his quivers in vengeance. (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 7.11, 12, 13.) <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day; if he turne not, he will whet his ſword, he hath bent his bow, and made it ready; he hath alſo prepared for him the inſtruments of death, he ordaineth his arrows againſt the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>The wounds which God makes cannot be healed by any medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines but his owne.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jobs</hi> wound was incurable, there was no balme for him in the <hi>Gilead</hi> of this world, no Phyſician there. And therefore the Lord
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:104248:275"/> bids <hi>Egypt,</hi> in ſcorne, ſeeke healing there (<hi>Jer:</hi> 46.11.) <hi>Goe up into Gilead and take balme, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vaine ſhalt thou uſe many medicines, for thou ſhalt not be cured.</hi> Who can heale where God will wound? (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 38.2, 3.) <hi>Thine arrows ſtick faſt in me, there is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh;</hi> even <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that the wounds which the arrows of God had made in him were incurable. <hi>Why is my paine perpetuall</hi> (ſaid the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Jer:</hi> 15.18.) <hi>and my wound incurable, which refuſeth to be healed? When Ephraim ſaw his ſickneſs, and Judah ſaw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Aſſyrian, and ſent to king Jareb to help him, yet could he not heale you, nor cure you of your wounds.</hi> (Hoſ: 5.13.) God gives ſtates or bodyes politick ſuch wounds, as all the medicines and meanes in the world cannot helpe; They may goe to the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and ſend to king <hi>Jareb,</hi> to this and that power; They may call a whole colledge of State-Phyſicians or deepeſt politicians for counſel and adviſe, yet neither one nor other can be a healer to them. Therefore in the next Chapter (<hi>v.</hi> 1.) the Church concluded upon another courſe, and a better addreſſe, then either to the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> or to king <hi>Jareb. Come let us returne unto the Lord, for he hath torne, and he will heale us;</hi> only the Lord who gives the wound can heale the wound; the ſame hand which ſmites us muſt cure us, elſe our wound is incurable.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>To complaine of our wounds as incurable, or paſt cure, is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of our unbeliefe.</q>
                  <p>'Tis good for us even to deſpaire of help from creatures, and to ſay the leaſt wound (if but the ſcratch of a pin) is incurable by all the art, meanes, and medicines which this world can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter, but to ſay our wound (though never ſo deep, dangerous, and deadly) is abſolutely incurable, is our ſin. While we ruine our ſelves (that is, while we provoke God to ruine us, yet) there is hope in God; <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelfe, but in me is thine helpe</hi> (Hoſ: 13.9.) <hi>deſpaire as much as you will of creatures helpe, but ſtill hope in God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In that he ſaith, <hi>My wound is incurable without tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="529" facs="tcp:104248:275"/>The Lord may, and doth take liberty to afflict thoſe grievouſly, who have not ſinned greatly.</q>
                  <p>There is no man liveth and ſinneth not, yet every man is not (in ſtrict ſenſe) a ſinner, that is, a great ſinner, a rebell, a worker of iniquity; yet the Lord when 'tis needfull giveth them great wounds, who have not (comparatively) ſinned greatly. Though no ſin ſhould be little in our eye, yet there are degrees of ſin, and ſome are leſſe then others in the eye both of God and man. <hi>Elihu</hi> chargeth <hi>Job,</hi> not as ſaying he had no ſin, but becauſe he complained his wounds were great, though his ſins were not; or that there was not a due proportion between his offence and his puniſhment, his ſins and his ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Fourthly.</p>
                  <q>Though the Lord taketh liberty to afflict thoſe greatly that have not ſinned greatly, yet they muſt not take liberty to complaine of the greatneſs of their afflictions, how little ſoever their ſins have been.</q>
                  <p>A gracious heart lookes upon the leaſt of his mercies, as grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the greateſt of his good deſervings, and upon the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of his ſufferings, as leſſe then the leaſt of his ill deſervings or demerits. And ſurely (beſides that liberty which God hath, as he is ſupreame, and ſoveraigne, to afflict whom he will, and in what degree he will we muſt know, that, the leaſt ſin deſerves the greateſt wound. An evill thought deſerves all the evill that can be heaped upon us. Whatſoever we ſuffer on this ſide hell is leſs then the leaſt of our ſins. And therefore if we have reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our little ſins great, and our greateſt wounds little, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with our little ſins; how much more ſhould we confeſſe our great ſufferings little, compared with our great ſins, as the Church did (<hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13.) <hi>After all that is come upon us</hi> (our long and hard bondage in <hi>Babylon) for our evill deeds, and for our great treſpaſſe, thou O Lord, haſt puniſhed us leſſe then our iniquities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, from the whole verſe, in that <hi>Elihu</hi> chargeth <hi>Job</hi> with theſe ſeverall ſayings.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Firſt.</p>
                  <q>A good mans ſayings are often worſe then his meanings.</q>
                  <pb n="530" facs="tcp:104248:276"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> rebuketh his ſpeeches, not his ſpirits; his words though in ſome reſpect true, yet were dangerous, and becauſe not well explained by himſelfe, ſcandalous to others, But his heart was not trecherous, not the bent of his mind wrong ſet, in uttering them. Evill men may ſpeake good words, but 'tis with a bad heart; Good men ſometimes ſpeake bad and offenſive words, yet with honeſt hearts; and when their mindes are ſerene, and they clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from thoſe clouds of perturbation, which have darkned them, they (as <hi>Job</hi>) are ready to recant them, and repent of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>It is an high offence to intimate any thing which doth in the leaſt intrench upon the Juſtice, and righteouſneſs of God.</q>
                  <p>To ſay, God hath taken away our judgement, may call downe judgements; To ſay, we are wounded without tranſgreſſion, is a great tranſgreſſion; and the reaſon, why it is ſo, is plaine, becauſe ſuch ſayings, tell the world, that we ſuffer, if not quite without deſert, yet more then we deſerve; and what is this but to juſtifie our ſelves, and lay blame upon God, then which (as was ſhewed at the 2d verſe of the 32d Chapter) nothing is more derogatory to God, or more blame-worthy in man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>If we ſpeak amiſſe, or indiſcreetly about the dealings of God with us, we may thank our ſelves if we are hardly cenſured, and ſoundly chidden for it.</q>
                  <p>Though <hi>Jobs</hi> heart was honeſt, yet his tongue was intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and he too bold with God; and you ſee how God ſtir'd up the ſpirit of <hi>Elihu</hi> to lay it home to him, and bring him upon his knees for it. They who vent unwarrantable ſpeeches, muſt not thinke much if they meet with ſharpe reproofes and cutting cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. Tongue-faults ſeldome eſcape without tongue-laſhes; And 'tis a mercy to meete with them from a faithfull friend; Their laſhing and cutting tongues prove healing tongues, (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 141.5.)</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Note.</p>
                  <q>Every ſpeaker is at the mercy of his hearers.</q>
                  <p>No man knows what gloſſe his words may have put upon them
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:104248:276"/> when once uttered. Here are foure ſayings brought againſt <hi>Job,</hi> yet <hi>Job</hi> never ſpoke any of them expreſſely, or in ſo many words, but ſuch collections were made (indeed they were, as not falſe, ſo not favourable collections) from what he had ſpoken. And he had but a poore remedy left, to ſay he did not meane them ſo. Take heed what you ſpeak, words are uſually judged as others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, not as you mean them. Indeed charity doth always incline to the beſt conſtruction; and will not interpret that ill, which may beare a better interpretation. But who knoweth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his words ſhall alwayes meete with a charitable interpreter, our words doe not often meete with juſt and equall ones. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, indeed, is more common with uncourteous hearers, then to miſconſter thoſe they heare, or to judge of what is ſpoken rather as it may be taken to the ſpeakers hurt and defamation, then their owne profit or inſtruction. And therefore though I would adviſe every hearer to uſe as much charity as may be, yet I would alſo adviſe every ſpeaker to leave as little as may be to the charity of his hearers.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the firſt part of the charge in theſe foure ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. In the three verſes following, <hi>Elihu</hi> proſecutes the charge, and ſtandeth in admiration, as here at the ſayings of <hi>Job,</hi> ſo there of his doings.</p>

               <p>THeſe three verſes containe the ſecond charge or accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which <hi>Elihu</hi> had drawne up againſt <hi>Job.</hi> And in it we may diſtinctly conſider; Firſt, the forme of it; Secondly, the matter of it.</p>
               <p>The forme of it is by way of queſtion; <hi>What man is like Job?</hi> The matter of it conſiſts of three heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That he was a man of a ſcornfull ſpirit towards others, or that he had ſubjected himſelfe to the ſcorne of others; <hi>What man is like Job, which drinketh up ſcorning like water?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Elihu</hi> chargeth him, as having fellowſhip with men of a vaine and offenſive converſation (<hi>v.</hi> 8th) <hi>Which goeth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, He chargeth him (which is indeed the ground of the former) That he was a man, not only of unſound, but of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous principles and opinions (<hi>v.</hi> 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) <hi>For he hath ſayd, it profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a man nothing that he ſhould delight himſelfe with God.</hi> This 9th verſe is the proofe of the eighth; For ſome might enquire, How doth it appeare, that, <hi>Job goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men? Elihu</hi> anſwers, It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by his words, or from his owne mouth; <hi>For he hath ſayd, it profiteth a man nothing, that he ſhould delight himſelfe with God.</hi> And if a man once judge that there is no profit in the wayes of God, he thereby declares his conſent to the wayes of the wicked. That's the ſumme of the charge, and theſe the parts of it.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The word rendred <hi>man,</hi> doth not ſignifie every ordinary man, but a great or wiſe man, a famous or a powerfull man. What great
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:104248:277"/> or wiſe man is like <hi>Job?</hi> Poſſibly ſome may be found among the dreggs of the people or among the common ſort like himſelfe, but among men of honour and reputation for wiſdome, ſurely, there are none to be found like him. Yet ſome take it (out of the ſtrictneſs of the original word) for a man of the loweſt or meaneſt condition; What man is like <hi>Job?</hi> that is, no man, no not of the meaneſt degree is like him. And ſo the queſtion may be carryed under a threefold notion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As a vilifying queſtion, <hi>What man is like Job?</hi> Who is there that hath but the name and face of a man that would doe or ſpeak things as he? <hi>Job,</hi> in this matter, is worſe then any man, then the worſt of men. He acts and ſpeaks at a lower rate of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and piety then many, if not then any of the loweſt among the ſons of men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may look upon it as an angry paſſionate que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, a queſtion carrying in it higheſt indignation; <hi>What man is like Job?</hi> who ſo vaine, raſh, fooliſh and inconſiderate as he? I have ſcarce the patience to ſpeake or think of him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We may take it as an admiring queſtion; <hi>What man is like Job?</hi> It is a thing unheard of, even a ſtupendious prodigie, that a man ſhould be or doe as <hi>Job.</hi> All ſorts of men abſtaine from or decline, yea ſcorne ſcorning ('tis a thing ſo unbecoming man) but chiefly they that are great, noble and honourable, ſuch as <hi>Job</hi> hath been in his time, yet he is turned ſcorner. As if he had ſayd, Who hath heard the like? was there ever ſuch a man heard of, who either uſed ſuch ſcornfull language againſt others, or layd himſelfe ſo open to the ſcorne and contempt of others! <hi>What man is like Job,</hi>
                     <q>Who drinketh up ſcorning like water?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That's matter of admiration; <hi>Elihu</hi> might have found out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other matters, wherein <hi>Job</hi> had no fellow, no parallel, ſcarce any like him in the world; who ſo afflicted, ſo humbled, ſo broken, ſo deſerted by his owne relations, ſo vexed with friends and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters like <hi>Job?</hi> But he doth not put the queſtion upon his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, but upon his ſin; <hi>What man is like Job, who drinketh up ſcorning,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Drinking</hi> is here uſed metaphorically, and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are eating, devouring, and ſwallowing up often uſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to denote that which is done to be done with much greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:104248:278"/> and with a kind of delight. And whereas there is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold meaſure or degree of drinking; Firſt, ſoberly, or for neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: Secondly, plentifully or for moderate delight; Thirdly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, or for drunkenneſs, and the ſatisfying of a luſt. This third ſeemeth to be here intended, even an exceſſive drinking of ſcorne, till he was as a drunken or mad-man with it, or (as we ſay) mad drunke; For the text ſaith, <hi>What man is like Job, who drinketh up ſcorning.</hi> He doth not only taſt it a little, and ſip at the ſcorners cup, but drinks it up to a drop, or to the bottome. <hi>He drinketh up</hi>
                     <q>ſcorning.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Quis ita ride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur et ſannis exxipitur ut Job? bibit ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſannationem id eſt ſubſanna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Druſ:</hi> Significat Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bux ad ſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum omnes provocare cum talibus ſermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus utitur. <hi>Merc:</hi>
                     </note>And that's a ſtrange kind of drink, one of the worſt if not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the worſt of Natures brewing. Scorning may be taken 2 ways, either paſſively or actively; ſome take it in a paſſive ſignification; <hi>What man is like Job, who drinketh up ſcorning like water?</hi> that is, who is ſo ſcorned, or who ſubjecteth himſelfe to the ſcorn of men as he hath done. What wiſe or diſcreete man did ever lay himſelf ſo naked, ſo open to contempt as he? or who like him would render himſelfe ſo ridiculous, ſuch a laughing ſtock to all his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who are but rationall and underſtanding men? It cannot be denied (nor doth <hi>Elihu</hi> in ſpeaking thus courſely of him deny it) but that <hi>Job,</hi> moved doubtleſs by the holy Ghoſt, had ſpoken ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent things, full of divine light and learning, yet moved with paſſion, he ſpake ſometimes much amiſſe, and is charged for it, as if like a ſhameleſs perſon, he had proffered himſelfe, by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh and intemperate language to the laſh of every tongue.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Scorning may be taken actively; <hi>What man is like Job, who drinketh ſcorning like water?</hi> That is, where ſhall we find ſuch a ſcorner? who hath uttered ſo many reproachfull ſpeeches, as <hi>Job?</hi> He drinketh ſcorning, as if he thought he could never fill himſelfe enough with ſcorning. This interpretation may have a a double reference.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To his friends, who it ſeemes, were very ſenſible that he put ſcornes upon them. <hi>Zophar</hi> complaineth of it (<hi>Chap:</hi> 11.3.) <hi>When thou mockeſt ſhall no man make thee aſhamed;</hi> As if he had ſayd, when thou haſt mocked and derided us, ſhall we let thee alone, and ſay nothing? ſhall we ſuffer our ſelves to be abuſed and paſſe it by in ſilence? ought we not to tell thee of it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:104248:278"/> thee for it openly, and to thy face, that thou mayeſt ſee thy error and be aſhamed of it?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, (which is yet higher, and I judge too high) his ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is referred by ſome to the dealings and providences of God,<note place="margin">Bibere ſubſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationem velut aquam eſt eſſe plenum ſermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis. <hi>Vatabl:</hi>
                     </note> as if he had ſpoken of them with a kind of ſcorne, at leaſt with that irreverence, and ſlightneſs of ſpirit, which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> did early and earneſtly admoniſh him of (<hi>Chap:</hi> 5.17.) <hi>Deſpiſe not thou the chaſtning of the Lord;</hi> and which the Apoſtle cals <hi>The exhortation, which ſpeaketh unto us as unto children</hi> (Heb: 12.5.) <hi>My ſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not thou the chastening of the Lord.</hi> Thus alſo <hi>Elihu</hi> may in a qualified ſence be underſtood charging <hi>Job</hi> with <hi>drinking up ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like water.</hi> As if upon the whole matter he had ſayd, <hi>Job hath drunke ſcorne till he is almoſt drunken with it, at leaſt, he is ſo full of it, that he powres it out upon every one that comes neare him, and which is worſt of all, he ſpeakes ſo unbecomingly, that we ſhall not much wrong him, if we ſay he hath ſpoken or acted deſpiſingly (which is a degree of ſpeaking or acting ſcornefully) concerning the chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God upon him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, When 'tis ſaid, <hi>He drinketh ſcorning like water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may imply three things; Firſt, the frequency of his ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he doth it commonly, he is at ſcorning as often as at drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Secondly, the content which he was ſuppoſed to take in ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>water</hi> cooleth and refreſheth the heated and wearied body: Thirdly, it may note the eaſineſs or naturallneſs of it to him. To drinke is naturall to man, it puts him to no paines nor ſtudy. We ſay proverbially of that which a man doth without trouble; He doth it as eaſily as he drinkes. But of this word <hi>drinking</hi> and <hi>drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like water,</hi> the reader may ſee more upon thoſe words (<hi>Chap:</hi> 15.16.) <hi>Man drinketh iniquity like water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Once more, whereas <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith of <hi>Job, He drinketh ſcorning like water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some have made a criticall obſervation or diſtinction about it; <hi>Elihu</hi> doth not ſay, he drinketh ſcorning like <hi>wine,</hi> but like <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> They who are provoked or led on to ſin by the delight and ſweetneſs which they find in ſin, are ſayd to drink it <hi>like wine (Prov:</hi> 4.17.) They drink the wine of violence; or they drink
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:104248:279"/> violence <hi>like wine.</hi> It goeth downe ſweetly and pleaſantly; But (ſay they) ſuch as ſin, not out of pleaſure but out of will or out of an affected maliciouſneſs, are ſayd <hi>to drink iniquity like water,</hi> which hath little pleaſure in it, little ſweetneſs or taſt in it. There's ſmall ſavour in water comparatively to wine and other delicate or delicious liquors. So that (according to this notion) they drink iniquity like water, who ſin for ſins ſake. And indeed ſome are ſo delighted in ſin it ſelf, that they will ſin in that which yeilds them no delight. The very act of doing evill is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentfull to them, then any fruit or conſequent of it. But we need not ſtay in this nicity, the generall ſence falls hard enough upon <hi>Job,</hi> to drink ſcorning like water, is to be much and often in ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Water is the cheapeſt liquor, and of moſt common uſe; every man can goe to the price of that which coſts nothing (in moſt places) but the labour of taking it up. <hi>What man is like Job, that drinketh ſcorning like water?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Taking the words in a paſſive ſence, as <hi>Job</hi> was a perſon ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and drunk in the ſcornes of men powred upon him, as the earth drinketh in water.</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>He behaveth himſelfe unlike a man, that layeth himſelfe open to, and readily admits the ſcorne of men.</q>
                  <p>It is an affliction to be ſcorned by others; But it is a ſin to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our ſelves a ſcorne to others, and not to be ſencible of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, (which I rather adhere to) taking the active ſence, he is charged with ſpeaking ſcornfully to his friends, or of the dealings of God with him; how farre this charge might reach <hi>Job,</hi> hath been toucht a little already; and will be cleared yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the cloſe of the whole matter brought againſt him in this context. But in the meane time, from the general ſence of the words (not concluding <hi>Job</hi> broadly ſuch a one)</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Scorners are the vileſt ſort of men.</q>
                  <p>What man is like <hi>Job,</hi> who drinketh ſcorning? Not to doe good is ſinfull, but either to ſcorn that which is good or thoſe that are good is farre more ſinfull. That man is gone his furtheſt length, or aſcended to the higheſt ſtep of ſin, who turneth ſcorner, or
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:104248:279"/> gives himſelfe a liberty to ſcorne others. The firſt words of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeake this (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 1.1.) <hi>Bleſſed is the man that walketh not in the counſell of the ungodly, nor ſtandeth in the way of ſinners, nor ſitteth in the ſeat of the ſcornfull.</hi> Here are three degrees of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; walking, ſtanding, ſitting: He that ſitteth in the ſeate of the ſcornfull, or hath commenced <hi>ſcorner,</hi> hath taken the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and is the chiefe Graduate in the Schooles of ſin. And as to ſit in the ſeate of the ſcornfull, is the higheſt degree of ſinning, ſo they that are got into that ſeat, care not how long they ſit in it, yea, are hardly ever got out of it. So much that chiding queſtion or expoſtulation of <hi>Solomon</hi> doth fully import (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22.) <hi>Ye ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, how long will ye delight in ſcorning?</hi> As if he had ſayd, When ſhall it once be? will ye never have done, nor give over that trade? Scorners are therefore the worſt of men, becauſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride the beſt both of things and men (<hi>Prov:</hi> 21.24.) <hi>Proud and haughty ſcorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.</hi> Scorners are the children of pride. A proud ſpirit vents it ſelfe in ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Pride doth not appeare ſo much in apparrell, in gay clothes and new fangled faſhions (all which are often uſed as flaggs of pride and vanity) nor doth pride appeare ſo much in praiſing our ſelves (though there it appeareth much) as it doth in ſcorning others. <hi>Proud ſcorner is his name.</hi> And as the ſcorner is a proud deſpiſer of others, ſo a quarrelſome contender with others, and till he is ſeparated from men, there is nothing but ſeparation, no peace among men (<hi>Prov:</hi> 22.10.) <hi>Caſt out the ſcorner, and contention ſhall goe out; yea ſtrife and reproach ſhall ceaſe;</hi> which plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateth, that ſtrife cannot goe out till the ſcorner be caſt out. And therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> (Pro: 24.9.) calleth <hi>the ſcorner an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to man.</hi> Thus the Scripture ſets the ſcorner among ſinners of the chiefeſt rank and firſt forme; I may ſay, he is of the firſt three, if not the firſt of that three. Therefore take heed how ye drinke ſcorning, eſpecially take heed it be not your mornings draught; for as it comes from the heart, ſo it will fly up into your head, and unfit you for any good worke, at leaſt, that day.</p>
                  <p>Againe, from the ſimilitude here uſed, <hi>to drink up ſcorning like water,</hi> which (as hath been ſhewed) holds out the readineſs and connaturallneſs of an action unto him that is charged with it.</p>

                  <p>As our holineſſe is expreſſed by walking with God, ſo our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe by walking with wicked men. To walk with God is all the commendation of <hi>Enoch,</hi> who was ſo holy on earth that God tooke him up to Heaven, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 5.22.) <hi>He had this teſtimony</hi> (faith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.15.) <hi>before his tranſlation, that he pleaſed God. To walk with God, is to pleaſe God,</hi> or to give up our ſelves wholly to God. <hi>Can two walk together except they be agreed?</hi> is the Prophets queſtion, (<hi>Amos</hi> 3.3.) They who walke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are ſuppoſed to have one will, as they are ſeen to have one way. What God willeth they will, and what God willeth not, they will not who walk with him. To <hi>walk with wicked men</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth an agreement with them, and a conformity to them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their fraternity, company and livery. They that walk with wicked men, declare their familiarity with them, or that their mind and manners are the ſame. The Apoſtle tells the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2.) <hi>Whereas there is among you envying, ſtrife and diviſions, are ye not carnall and walk as men,</hi> that is, as men in their naturall and ſinfull condition walke. Though ye are ſpirituall in your ſtate, yet ye act as carnall men. Now, as it is ſinfull for a godly man to walke <hi>as a man,</hi> or according to man, (as our Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin hath it, for he ſhould walk <hi>as God</hi>) ſo it is much more ſinfull to walk with wicked men, or according to the worſt of men. Thus the Apoſtle deſcribes the converſation of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> before converſion. (<hi>Eph.</hi> 22.) <hi>And you hath he quickened who were dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, in which ſometime ye walked according to the courſe of this World.</hi> That is, according to the tide, current and ſtreame of the times and places wherein ye lived.<note place="margin">Qua itur non qua <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Man naturally doth not walk where he ought to goe, but where he ſeeth the moſt goe.</hi> He is led by the worſt of examples (ſuch are the examples of the moſt or of the many) rather then by the beſt of rules. It is our duty, and it ſhould be our delight to walk with thoſe who delight in the Law and in the way of God. <hi>David</hi> ſaith of his deceitfull friend, but reall enemy. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.14.) <hi>We walked unto the houſe of God in company.</hi> As if he had ſaid, time was when he and I were as if he had been I, both of us but one, in that one thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:104248:281"/> the worſhip and ſervice of God. It is a good argument, that man hath an heart for God, who walks with good men in the wayes of God. To converſe much with or to be much in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of good men, is a probable ſigne of goodneſſe; but when we walke with them to the houſe and worſhip of God, or converſe with them in the dutyes of holineſſe, this is a great (though no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible) argument of goodneſſe. And to be ſure to walk with evill men, eſpecially to joyne with them in doing evill is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the man is evill. Therefore <hi>Elihu</hi> may ſeeme to bring a demonſtration againſt <hi>Jobs</hi> godlineſſe (that he intended it not ſo I ſhall ſhew afterwards, but, I ſay, he ſeemes to ſay ſo) while he ſaith, <hi>Job walketh with wicked men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Hebrew Phraſe uſed in the Text is more then (as we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe) <hi>wicked men,</hi> we may render it <hi>men of wickedneſſe;</hi> the Scripture calleth thoſe men ſo who are (as it were) transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into wickedneſſe, or formed up of wickedneſſe. As ſome men are ſo witty, that we call them <hi>men of wit,</hi> and others ſo judicious that we call them <hi>men of judgment,</hi> as ſome are ſo skilfull and cunning, that we call them <hi>men of skill and cunning;</hi> ſo ſome are ſo wicked, that the Scripture calls them <hi>men of wickedneſſe;</hi> even with theſe very dregs of mankind, it ſeemes <hi>Job</hi> conſorted. <hi>He goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here it may be queſtioned, was it indeed ſo with <hi>Job,</hi> or was <hi>Job</hi> ſuch a man as he is expreſly charged to be both in this and the former verſe? Did <hi>Elihu</hi> judge him <hi>a ſcorner, a compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the workers of iniquity, and a walker with men of wickedneſſe?</hi> Doubtleſſe that's not <hi>Elihu</hi>'s ſcope or intention; nor could he imagine that <hi>Job,</hi> in ſtrict ſence, was either a ſcorner of good men, or choſe the company of wicked men. And ſurely all that knew <hi>Job</hi> could certifie (upon their knowledge) that he was a man of a gracious ſpirit and unblemiſht life; that he loved good men and ſweetly converſed with them, and therefore was farre from cloſing with deboyſt companions, or men of a profligate ſpirit. Why then doth <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeak thus? or ſpake he the words of truth and ſobriety while he ſpake thus?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, this forme of ſpeaking doth not alwayes import a likeneſſe of converſation and diſpoſition, as ſometimes it doth, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.11, 15.) <hi>Come with us, and caſt in thy lot among us,
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:104248:281"/> let us all have one purſe. My ſon, walk not thou in the way with them, refraine thy foot from their path;</hi> that is, doe not hearken to the call of thoſe workers of iniquity. Here in the Text to goe in company with the workers of iniquity, and to walke with wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, notes only the doing or ſpeaking that which carryeth ſome likeneſſe to them, not a being altogether like them. A man is ſaid to goe and walke with others, when he ſpeaks or doth that which ſeemes to ſuite and favour their principles, opinions or practices, though in truth they are the abhorrence of his ſoul. <hi>Elihu</hi> durſt not, could not aſſert directly and properly that <hi>Job,</hi> who was a man famous for piety in the dayes of his proſperity, and who in his affliction had not the leaſt degree of ability or oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for it, walked with wicked men: But becauſe in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of his ſoul he ſpake ſometimes intemperately of the dealings of God (which is the guiſe, ſpiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and common language, in ſuch caſes, of wicked and ungodly men) therefore he chargeth him as ſymbolizing or complying with men of wickedneſſe. So that when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>he goeth with wicked men,</hi> he doth not accuſe him for keeping bad company in his proſperity; but with ſpeaking hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of God in his adverſity, as ungodly men uſe to doe, when they are under his hand. He doth not ſay, you upon ſuch and ſuch a day kept evill company and converſed with men of wickedneſſe; but you have ſpoken much like the wicked in the day of your calamity. That this was his ſcope appeares plainly by the proofe of this charge, which is alſo a new charge (<hi>verſ.</hi> 9.) <hi>For he hath ſaid, it profiteth a man nothing that he ſhould delight himſelf with God. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihu</hi> doth not ſay, <hi>Job</hi> walketh with wicked men, for we have ſeen him in their company, and he hath been as vaine and wicked as they. But his proofe that <hi>Job</hi> walked with the wicked was from his words; <hi>For he hath ſaid it profiteth a man nothing,</hi> &amp;c. This is the language of the wicked, thus they uſe to ſpeak about the wayes of God; and <hi>Job</hi> hath ſpoken thus; therefore, <hi>What man is like Job that drinketh ſcorning like water, which goeth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</hi> I need not ſtay here to ſhew how great an evill it is to keepe evill company, for that was not the ſin which <hi>Job</hi> was accuſed of. Yet from the letter of the Text,</p>
                  <pb n="542" facs="tcp:104248:282"/>
                  <p>Note firſt.</p>
                  <q>To aſſociate with wicked men, or to chuſe wicked men for our company, is the mark of a wicked man.</q>
                  <p>A godly man may be among wicked men, but he doth not chuſe their company. He while with them is as <hi>Lot</hi> was in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> his righteous ſoule is vexed. A godly man is among wicked men, as his graces are among his corruptions; as his humility is with his pride, his faith with his unbeliefe, theſe are all in his ſoul at once, but his faith doth alwayes ſtrive againſt his unbeliefe, his humility oppoſeth his pride, his grace of ſelf-deniall, reſiſts his ſelf-ſeeking, his meekneſs his paſſions, and his patience the unquietneſs of ſpirit. A godly man is pained in the company of wicked men, as <hi>David</hi> was (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 120.5.) <hi>Woe is me that I ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ in Meſech, and dwell in the tents of Kedar. David</hi> was there but he did not delight to be there. To aſſociate with the wicked is proper to the wicked. The Apoſtle gives that caution (<hi>Eph:</hi> 5.11.) <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitfull works of darkneſs, but rather reprove them.</hi> Seeing the works of darkneſs are unfruitfull of any good, it muſt needs be bad to have followſhip with them. As we muſt not at all joyn with wicked men in ſpirituall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or Church-fellowſhip (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 6.14.) <hi>Be not unequally yoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with unbelievers; for what communion hath light with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Chriſt with Belial,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Come out from among them, and touch no uncleane thing.</hi> So we ſhould have as little civill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion or fellowſhip with them as we can; and when we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to have civill communion with them, we muſt utterly avoyd all ſinfull communion with them, that is, communion with them in their ſins. It is both a ſhame to Goſpel profeſſion and a great offence to the ſincere profeſſors of the Goſpel, when they who profeſſe it are much in the company of the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and walke with wicked men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the matter of the charge,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>While godly men behave themſelves like wicked men, they may be ſayd to goe in company with them.</q>
                  <p>This heavy charge falls juſtly upon them whether they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane themſelves in their affliction (as <hi>Job</hi> in ſome ſort did)
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:104248:282"/> like the wicked, or in the dayes of their fullneſs and proſperity. If we ſpeake or doe like wicked men, we have our amends in our hands if we are numbred with them, though we are not really of their number. Some good men when they have got much of the world about them make but an ill uſe of it. Are wicked rich men proud? ſo are they in a great meaſure, you may ſee vanity in their houſes, and ſuperfluity upon their tables, as if they alſo were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king proviſion for the fleſh to fullfill the luſts thereof. Now if a godly man, when he hath the abundance of this world makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe more unfit for the next world; is he not in this like the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? or if when God layeth him low, he be full of complainings and have riſings of heart againſt the dealings of God; what is this but to do like the wicked, who in their ſtraits quarrell with God, &amp; blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme his name? (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 8. <hi>ult.) When they are hungry and hard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead, they curſe their God and their King.</hi> Thus the wicked doe; and it was the Devills plot to make <hi>Job</hi> do ſo too; and becauſe in the extremity of his ſufferings he ſpake ſuch things as ſavour'd of a murmuring ſpirit, <hi>Elihu</hi> taxeth him as walking with wicked men. For as when wicked men act and ſpeake like good men, it may be ſayd they goe in the company with the godly, and walke with the workers of righteouſneſs, though they are ſtarke nought all the while, being (as the Apoſtle gives their character, <hi>Tit:</hi> 1.16.) <hi>Abominable, diſobedient, and unto every good worke reprobate;</hi> So ſome good men under temptation act and ſpeak like the wicked, yet retaine their goodneſs, and are as to the generall ſtate of their perſons, and bent of their hearts, acceptable, obedient, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to every good worke. It will doe the wicked no good at laſt, that they have thus gone in company with the good; but it is very ſinfull for and hurtfull to good men, to goe in company or walk with wicked men, though it be but (as <hi>Elihu</hi> makes his proofe of it againſt <hi>Job</hi>) only in uſing their <hi>Sibboleth,</hi> or ſpeaking a language like theirs.</p>

                     <pb n="544" facs="tcp:104248:283"/>He hath ſayd, it proſiteth a man nothing.</q>
                  <p>That is, a man ſhall get nothing, or have no advantage by it. As Chriſt ſaith (<hi>Mark</hi> 8.36.) <hi>What ſhall it profit a man to gaine the whole world, and loſe his owne ſoule?</hi> But what was this trade which <hi>Elihu</hi> accuſeth <hi>Job</hi> to have called unprofitable?

                     <q>that he ſhould delight himſelfe with God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This goes deep; <hi>Elihu</hi> doth not tax him with ſaying it profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a man nothing to doe this or that good, which God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but (which is more) <hi>that he ſhould</hi>

                     </note>The word rendred <hi>to delight,</hi> hath a three-fold ſignification, and all very full to this poynt and text.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>To run,</hi> which is the ſpeed of our pace. Thus the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint render it, <hi>Although he run with God</hi> (Cant: 1.4.) <hi>By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſavour of thy good oyntments, therefore doe the virgins love thee, draw us and we will run after thee.</hi> To run is more then to walk. To walk with God, notes our obſervance of all holy duties, but to run the way of Gods commandements, notes us zealous in them and for them. To run, requires not only an honeſt heart, but a large one; and therefore <hi>David</hi> ſayd (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 119.32.) <hi>I will run the way of thy commandements, when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart. Thou</hi> (ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi> to <hi>Job) haſt ſayd,</hi> (according to this reading of the word) <hi>it ſhall not profit a man though he run with God,</hi> though he make never ſo much ſpeed in his work and wayes; though he be (beſides faithfull and upright) forward and active for God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The word ſignifieth <hi>To have or be of the ſame will or mind with another.</hi> Thus alſo ſome render it here; <hi>It profiteth not a man, though he willeth with God, or be of the ſame mind with God.</hi> The Apoſtle exhorts (<hi>Phil:</hi> 2.5.) <hi>Let this mind be in you which was in Chriſt Jeſus. To will</hi> is an internall motion, <hi>to run</hi> an externall; How faſt ſoever a man may run with God in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actings, yet, poſſibly, he doth not will with God at all, nor hath a mind conformable to the mind of God. The hypocrite is thus ſet out (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 50.18, 19.) <hi>When thou ſaweſt a thiefe, thou
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:104248:283"/> conſentedſt with him,</hi> &amp;c. Thou hadſt a mind to be a thiefe as well as he. One wicked man minds and wills the ſame things with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all godly men will the ſame things with God. Yet (ſaith <hi>Job) it ſhall not profit a man,</hi> though he have the ſame will with God, or though he willeth the ſame good things which God himſelfe willeth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The word (according to our tranſlation) ſignifieth more then barely to will, it takes in the affections and joyes of the ſoule. He that delighteth in God, hath ſweet content and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in God, he not only approves of all the ſayings and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God, he not only followeth his counſell, and his conduct, but is highly pleaſed and fully ſatisfied in God. Delight is the reſt of the ſoule. When we delight in God, and find every act of obedience our joy and our ſong, our meat and our drink, then the heart is wound up to the higheſt pitch of holineſs. And therefore as his heart is fallen downe to the loweſt pitch of unholineſs, who ſayth, it profiteth a man nothing to ſerve God, ſo is his much more who ſaith, <hi>What ſhall it profit a man though he delight in God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here againe it may be queried, Where did <hi>Job</hi> ſay, <hi>that it ſhould profit a man nothing though he delight himſelfe with God?</hi> If you read his diſcourſe all over, he never ſpake theſe words directly or explicitely, they are the language of hell. But <hi>Job</hi> had ſpoken words, which (unleſs taken in a very favourable conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) might beare this cenſure. He ſpake thus, in a manner, while he at once juſtified himſelfe ſo much, and cryed out as much of the hard dealings of God wich him. And while in many paſſages of this Booke he denieth that the godly have a preſent reward in this life, and alſo affirmeth that many wicked men injoy out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proſperity, and paſſe unpuniſhed. Theſe ſpeeches might eaſily be interpreted (by common and carnal men eſpecially) that, <hi>Job</hi> thought it an unprofitable thing to delight in God. For if All things in this life come alike to all, to the godly, and to the wicked, what doth it profit a man (as to this life) that he ſhould delight himſelfe in God? who among the ſons of men (that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of no profit beyond this life) can delight himſelfe in that, which brings no profit? <hi>Job</hi> alſo ſayd (<hi>Chap:</hi> 9.22.) <hi>God deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the wicked and the righteous,</hi> that is, he afflicts the good as much as the bad, this was a principle which he held out all along.

                     <pb n="547" facs="tcp:104248:284"/> This grand prophaneſſe the Prophet rebukes (<hi>Mal:</hi> 3.14.) <hi>Ye have ſaid, It is in vaine to ſerve God, and what profit is there that we have kept his ordinances?</hi> Thus the carnal heart, which would faine free or keepe it ſelfe from keeping the ordinances of God, is ready to queſtion, whether there be any profit in keeping them. And while ſuch ſeeme only to put the queſtion, they indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there is no profit in keeping them; yet the truth is, the very keeping the ordinances of God, as it is an act of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, and of communion with him is very profitable, though we ſhould have no viſible nor ſenſible profit by it. In keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the commandements of God, <hi>there is great reward</hi> (Pſal: 19.11.) that is, the keeping of them is a reward, as well as a reward is promiſed to thoſe that keepe them. The Reader may conſult this poynt further, at the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Note, Thirdly.</p>
                  <q>Good men ſometimes ſpeak worſe then they meane.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> never thought it was no profit to ſerve God, yet he had let fall words which might beare that gloſſe. As wicked men often ſpeake better then they meane; They have golden words in their mouths, when there is nothing but droſs in their hearts; their words are ſmoother then oyle, yet they are drawne ſwords; their words ſound well, while they wound deep, (now as a carnal man ſpeakes often better then he meanes, and ſometimes ſpeakes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely the beſt when he meanes worſt) ſo a godly man ſpeakes ſometimes worſe then he meanes, or he may ſpeak ill when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends nothing but good. Holy <hi>David</hi> (which comes up fully to the ſence of what <hi>Job</hi> is taxed for ſaying here) ſayd (and what could he ſpeak more unholyly) (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 73.15.) <hi>Verily I have clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my heart in vaine,</hi> &amp;c. What language was here? would one think to heare <hi>David</hi> foule his mouth with ſuch words as theſe? would one think, that ſuch a word could have dropt from the mouth of <hi>David,</hi> whoſe mouth uſed to drop like an honey-comb, &amp; whoſe lips were wont to be like a tree of life feeding many? yet <hi>David</hi> in temptation, that is, in great affliction (for he there complaines that he was chaſtened every morning) ſpake thus with his tongue to the griefe of his heart a little after. The tongue is an unruly member, (as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap:</hi> 3.8.) <hi>The tongue can no man tame;</hi> we need a great command upon the heart to
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:104248:285"/> bridle the tongue, and tame that unruly beaſt. Many a good man hath been over-borne with his tongue. That little member hath ſometimes cruſht both ſoule and body very ſorely. <hi>Jobs</hi> tongue fell heavily upon him.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Inconſiderate words render us obnoxious to ſevereſt cenſures.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou haſt ſayd, It profiteth a man nothing to delight himſelfe in God, is a very ſevere cenſure;</hi> And though <hi>Joh</hi> did not deſerve it fully, yet he might have expreſſed himſelfe more commodiouſly and profitably. <hi>Juſt conſequences from what we ſay, may be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon us as our ſayings.</hi> Indeed to wier-draw words or ſtraine conſequences from them, is very unchriſtian. Some deale ſo with the holy Scriptures (2 <hi>Pet:</hi> 3.16.) <hi>Wreſting them to their owne deſtruction;</hi> They torture and ſtretch them upon the tenters to their owne hurt. And to wreſt a mans words, or as the Prophet ſpeakes (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 29.21.) <hi>To make a man an offender for a word,</hi> is an act of great uncharitableneſs towards man, and to God an high of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence (Not but that a man may be an offender for his words; nor can a man be more truly an offender for any words, then when he ſpeakes reproachfully or ſleightly of the workes of God) But when men ſpeak ſuch words as are reall offences, and yeild foule conſequences, fairly, they muſt beare the burden. And that was <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe here.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, If <hi>Job</hi> never ſpake theſe words in termes, nor any words like them, with ſuch an intent, why doth he ſuffer <hi>Elihu</hi> to to accuſe him, and not take off his accuſation, nor give a word of anſwer for himſelfe? Why did he not vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or make his Apology?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, and my anſwer ſhall be the laſt note from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text.</p>
                  <q>A godly man will rather beare more blame then he deſerveth, then ſtand to excuſe himſelfe when he hath deſerved any blame.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> replyed no more, ſpake no more, but to ſhew that he yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to what was ſayd, and ſubmitted to this diſpenſation of God in ſending <hi>Elihu</hi> to charge him thus. He tooke more upon him then he had ſayd, leſt he ſhould ſeeme to juſtifie any thing that
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:104248:285"/> he had ſayd amiſſe. (<hi>Chap:</hi> 40.5.) <hi>Once have I ſpoken, but I will not anſwer: yea twice, but I will proceed no further.</hi> As if he had ſayd, I will make no more pleas for my ſelfe, nor excuſes, I will cry guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the whole matter of my charge, though I might cleare and diſcharge my ſelfe of much of it. How far was the ſpirit of <hi>Job</hi> from theirs, who though charged with that only which they have directly done, or ſpoken, yet ſtand it out in pleading their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and will never fall downe before reproofes, though what they have done or ſpoken amiſſe, be ſo plaine, that it needs no proofe.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould be carefull to ſpeake and doe ſuch things as are not ſubject to reproofe, but when through ignorance or raſhneſs we have run into an error, either of ſpeech or practiſe, we ſhould be ſo humble as to ſubject our ſelves to reproofe, and take it well that we are rebuked for any evill. As it doubles an offence to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the defence of it, ſo not to defend an offence abateth and leſſeneth it. And as he who goeth about to cover his fault by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out arguments and pleas for it, ſheweth that he hath a will or purpoſe to continue in it; ſo he that is ſilent, and hath not a word to ſay for it, gives a good teſtimony both of his ſorrow that he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver committed it, and of his reſolution never to commit it any more. They are highly to be commended who live unblameably, and they deſerve no ſmall commendation, who being ſenſible of their owne fayling, can patiently beare the blame of it, without replying upon their reprovers.</p>

                     <hi>Elihu</hi> like a cunning Orator often ſtirr'd up his auditors to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and made frequent inſinuations to winde himſelfe and what he had to ſay into their good opinion.

                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The beſt may need to have their attentions quickened.</q>
                  <p>Some will not heare at all, they are like <hi>the deafe adder</hi> (Pſal. 48.4, 5.) <hi>that stoppeth her eare, which will not hearken to the voyce of the charmtr, charming never ſo wiſely;</hi> The Prophet reproves ſuch (<hi>Jer.</hi> 6.10.) <hi>To whom ſhall I ſpeak and give warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they may heare; behold their eare is uncircumciſed and they cannot hearken; behold, the Word of the Lord is to them a reproach, they have no delight in it; they cannot hearken,</hi> that is, they will not; or they cannot hearken, that is ſpiritually and obediential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though they have a naturall, yet they have not a gracious eare, as the ſame Prophet (<hi>chap.</hi> 11.6, 7, 8.) upbraided them; <hi>yet they obeyed not, nor enclined their eare.</hi> This ſinfull deafneſſe the Lord complained of alſo, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.8.) <hi>Heare O my people,</hi> (ſaith God) and at the 11 verſe, <hi>My people would not hearken to my voyce;</hi> Now as bad men will not heare at all to purpoſe; ſo the beſt ſeldome hear ſo well or to ſo good purpoſe as they ought and might.

                  <p>Secondly, note.</p>
                  <q>It is an incouragement in ſpeaking to have understanding hearers.</q>
                  <p>When a people have not only eares, but hearts to heare, then the word is heard indeed. We may ſuppoſe underſtanding men will probably prove the beſt hearers; the Prophet was in hope

(<hi>Jer.</hi> 5.4.) <hi>Surely theſe are poore,</hi> they are fooliſh (men of low parts, and thin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectualls) <hi>for they know not the way of the Lord, nor the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their God.

Though wiſdome be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to profitable hearing, yet all naturall wiſe men doe not hear profitably, nor indeed can any, by all the wiſdome of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, note.</p>
                  <q>A man without underſtanding is a heartleſſe man.</q>

To be without a heart is to be without a due apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the mind of God, or any true conformity thereunto; 'tis to have no knowledge either to doe good, or to be good; all ſuch are ſilly doves without a heart, without underſtanding, and all ſuch are yet unfit and unprepared hearers. <hi>Hearken to me ye men of underſtanding,</hi>

But this is not a true tranſlation according to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew; nor is it the truth of this place. <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaking in ſo weighty a matter might well ſay <hi>farre be it from me to pervert justice</hi> ſo much as in a word, becauſe I ſpeake before God, and am in the preſence of the Almighty. We ſhould not ſpeak a word amiſſe in his ſight or hearing, who ſeeth and heareth what all men doe and ſay, whatſoever they are doing or ſaying, eſpecially, when they are doing or ſaying that which is of neare concernment to himſelfe. This rendring gives us a uſefull caution. But doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>Elihu's</hi> purpoſe here was not to ſhew with what reverence of God, himſelfe was about to ſpeak, but that he was about to ſpeak for the vindication of the righteouſneſs of God, which he thought <hi>Job</hi> had wronged by that aſſertion when he ſaid, (<hi>verſ.</hi> 9.) <hi>It profiteth a man nothing that he ſhould delight himſelf with God.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Elihu</hi> with ſome heat of ſpirit turnes upon him in theſe words,

                  <q>If the Lord ſhould not reward thoſe that ſerve him, and delight in him, he were uxrighteous.</q>
                  <p>(Heb: 6.10.) <hi>God is not unrighteous to forget your labour of love;</hi> He is not unrighteous to forget it, that is, not to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence it; by forgetting it, he doth not meane the letting of it ſlip out of his mind, but the not making a due returne to it, or the not giving it a juſt reward. It is unrighteouſneſſe in God not to reward thoſe who ſerve him, becauſe he hath promiſed to reward them. <hi>Say to the righteous, it ſhall be well with him</hi> (Iſa: 3.10.) The promiſes run to it, all the Scripture over; and as it would be unrighteouſneſſe in God not to reward thoſe that do well; ſo not to pardon them that have done ill when they confeſſe their evill deeds, becauſe he hath promiſed to pardon them; and therefore the Scripture ſaith (1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9.) <hi>If we confeſſe our ſins, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſins.</hi> The Scripture doth not ſay, he is mercifull to forgive us our ſins, (though mercy act to the higheſt in the forgiveneſs of ſin) but he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſins; and the reaſon why the Scripture ſaith ſo, is becauſe forgiveneſs of ſin (in caſe of confeſſion) is under a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. To come ſhort of our promiſes, is to be unrighteous; promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are bonds upon the promiſer, and oblige to performance.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>The ſtrong God, the mighty God, neither doth nor can doe any unrighteouſneſſe or iniquity.</q>
                  <p>I ſay, he neither doth nor can doe iniquity. God can doe no ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, becauſe in him there is none. <hi>He is my rocke</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal:</hi> 92.15.) <hi>and there is no unrighteouſneſſe in him.</hi> As none can doe righteouſneſſe, but they that are righteous, ſo he that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is nor can be unrighteous, cannot doe any unrighteouſneſſe. That in the Pſalme is very conſiderable, that while he ſaith, <hi>There
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:104248:289"/> is no unrighteouſneſſe in God,</hi> he immediately before ſaid, <hi>He is my rocke;</hi> implying that God can no more be moved or removed from doing righteouſly, then a rocke can be removed out of its place. We find <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo giving God the ſame attribute, when he ſpake of his indeclinableneſs in juſtice (<hi>Deut:</hi> 32.4.) <hi>He is a rocke, his worke is perfect, all his wayes are Judgement.</hi> The wayes of God are not all judgement, as Judgement is oppoſed to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; ſome of his wayes are mercy, and others of them are Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but all his wayes are judgement, as Judgement is oppoſed to injuſtice or unrighteouſneſſe, that's the ſignification of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>All his wayes are Judgement, he is a God of truth, and without iniquity, juſt and right is he.</hi> The Apoſtle puts this denying queſtion with much vehemency (<hi>Rom:</hi> 9.14.) <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, is there unrighteouſneſſe with God? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</hi> And 'tis very conſiderable that the Apoſtle put this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with ſo much abhorrence, preſently after he had ſpoken of that Act of God which is ſo much quarrelled at by the ſons of men, as unrighteous and unjuſt; <hi>Eſau have I hated, and Jacob have I loved, and that, when they had done neither good nor evill</hi> (v. 11.) What (ſay ſome) will God doe thus? will he hate or love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever men doe good or evill? yeas, ſuch acts of love and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, of election and rejection are gone out from God. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Paul</hi> foreſaw, that men (according to their narrow appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion) would be ready to ſay, ſurely God is not right in this; therefore he ſubjoynes, <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? is there unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in God?</hi> As if he had ſayd, I know ſome men will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy enough to ſay ſo, and thinke they have reaſon enough to ſay ſo; They all muſt needs ſay ſo, who meaſure God by their ſhallow braines, (ſuch are the deepeſt braines compared with God) and therefore <hi>Arminius,</hi> with his followers, (that they may avoyd this difficulty) carry the interpretation of this Scripture to another poynt, as if it had nothing to doe with the eternall purpoſe of God concerning man, but only reſpected his dealings with them about temporalls, or his dealing out temporalls to them. I urge that text becauſe it hath occaſion'd (through mans corruption) great contending and quarrelling about the righteouſneſs of God; yea ſome have preſumed, there can be no maintaining that opinion of the abſolute decree, without faſtening unrighteouſneſſe upon God. But the Apoſtle by the Spirit foreſeeing this fleſhly obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:104248:290"/> hath forelayed and prevented it, concluding, <hi>O man, who art thou that replyeſt againſt God, ſhall the clay contend with the potter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now, as in this act of eternal Election, ſo in all providentiall acts, the Lord is infinitely unmoveably and unſpottedly juſt and righteous; he not only doth righteous things, but he cannot doe any thing that is unrighteous. And this ſeeming impotency is the reall power of God; and his moſt glorious perfection. For, as 'tis from the weakneſſe of man that he can doe iniquity, ſo 'tis from the power of God that he cannot. That God cannot lye, that he cannot doe any unworthy thing, is an argument of his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. God can no more doe iniquity, then he can ceaſe to be God; his righteouſneſſe, his juſtice is himſelfe; the Juſtice of God is the juſt God, the righteouſneſſe of God, is the righteous God; he hath not only a principle of righteouſneſſe in him, as man may have, and every Godly man truely hath, but he is righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.<note place="margin">

Homer:</note> A Heathen Poet had this apprehenſion of his Idol Gods; <hi>They love not unrighteouſneſſe, but honour Juſtice.</hi> But Jehovah the true, the living God, doth more then affectionately love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Juſtice, He is is eſſentially Juſt. That man who is in a ſtate of righteouſneſſe, loves to be doing and will doe righteous acts; things and perſons are in their working as they are in their being; <hi>He that doth righteouſneſſe is righteous,</hi> (1 John 3.7.) God is righteous, infinitely righteous, in his being, or nature, therefore he cannot but doe that which is righteous; to doe an unrighteous act were to offer violence to himſelfe, to deſtroy himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Againe, God doth not worke by a rule without him, as men doe (and therefore men often goe beſide the rule, and doe amiſſe, or act unrighteouſly, becauſe the rule is one thing, and they are another, the rule is without them) but God himſelfe is the very rule of all things, and hence it followeth undeniably, that every thing is righteous and juſt which he doth, even becauſe he doth it; 'tis enough to prove that right which is done, if we can prove God hath done it. The proud Monarch <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> was at laſt brought to this confeſſion (<hi>Dan:</hi> 4.34, 35.) <hi>At the end of the dayes</hi> (namely, of his ſeven yeares baniſhment to the beaſts) <hi>I Nebuchadnezzar lift up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding returned unto me, and I bleſſed the moſt high,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Who doth according to his will</hi> (there is the rule with him) <hi>in the Army
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:104248:290"/> of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can ſtay his hand, nor ſay unto him, what doſt thou?</hi> Which is true upon a double account, Firſt, as to his ſoveraignty and dominion, he is ſupreame Lord, and none can give him a check or countermand; <hi>Who may ſay unto him, what doſt thou?</hi> Secondly, with reſpect to his righteouſneſſe. As he can doe what he will; ſo he will doe nothing, yea he can doe nothing but what is right, or what he may; <hi>Who can ſay unto him, thou haſt done amiſſe? Who can ſee a fault, in any of his workes?</hi> If God hath done a thing, there is no query to be put about it whether it be right or no? for he is righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> uſeth another argument to ſhew that God can doe no unrighteouſneſſe (<hi>Gen:</hi> 18.25.) <hi>Shall not the Judge of all the earth doe right?</hi> God (ſaith he) is the Judge of all men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he neither will nor can doe wrong to any man. <hi>Abraham</hi> did not plead there, as if he doubted that God might goe wrong, unleſſe he by his interceſſion did take him off; but he brings an argument whereby he was aſſured that God would doe right, yea could not but doe right. <hi>He is the Judge of all the earth.</hi> So (<hi>Rom:</hi> 3.6.) aſſoone as the Apoſtle had ſayd, <hi>Is God unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that takes vengeance? I ſpeak as a man;</hi> he ſubjoynes, <hi>God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, how then ſhall God judge the world?</hi> God is Judge of all the world, and the univerſality of his power puts him above all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of error in the exerciſe of his power. The very reaſon why God doth not, cannot exerciſe his power beyond or beſides the limits of juſtice, is becauſe his power is altogether unlimited.</p>

                  <q>The worke of a man ſhall he render to him.</q>
                  <p>The work of a man is here put for the reward, iſſue, or fruit of his work; God doth not render every mans work to him in kind, that is, the thing it ſelfe which he hath done, but the work in its reſult and reward. That which God returneth to a man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his work, may be called a reward in a fourfold reſpect. Firſt, becauſe it hath in it the benefit of a reward to the worker. Secondly, becauſe it is given in anſwer to the work done. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe God hath given his people leave, yea a command to beleeve and waite for good fruit to themſelves, when they doe good works. Fourthly, becauſe it is proportion'd to the work or duty performed. For as good is returned for good, ſo great good is returned for great good done. Though the greateſt good that ever was or can be done by a meere creature doth not deſerve (by any intrinſick worth) the leaſt good at the hand of God. Thus ſaith the Spirit (<hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13.) <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that dye in the Lord, from hence forth they reſt from their labours, and their works follow them;</hi> not the workes which they did, but that which is by promiſe due to them for thoſe workes. The Prophet aſſureth us (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.17.) <hi>The work of righteouſneſs is peace;</hi> we cannot underſtand it as a direct predication, but peace is the fruit or iſſue of the worke of righteouſneſs, or as the latter part of the verſe clearly expounds it, <hi>The effect of righteouſneſſe ſhall be quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and aſſurance for ever.</hi> Which as it is moſt true of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>who is our peace</hi> (Epheſ. 2.14.) and our <hi>Peacemaker through the blood of his croſs</hi> (Col. 1.20.) So it is true of mans righteouſneſs, the work whereof is (by promiſe) crowned with the bleſſings of peace, both ſpirituall and corporall, temporall and eternall. <hi>The work of a man</hi>

(<hi>Math.</hi> 12.36, 37.) <hi>For every idle word, that men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof in the day of judgment; for by thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned;</hi> that is, it ſhall be rendered to thee according to thy words, or as thy words have been, ſo it ſhall be with thee. Nor ſecondly, are we to take the works of a man, excluſively, or in oppoſition to his thoughts; as if God would render to man what he hath acted outwardly, but not what he hath acted inwardly, or would paſſe by his thoughts. We muſt give an account of our thoughts, which are the ſpring of our works as well as of our words, which are the publiſhers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimers of them. <hi>God ſhall bring every work</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccl. 12.14.) <hi>to judgment, and every ſecret thing,</hi> the moſt ſecret whiſpers of the tongue, and the moſt ſecret plottings, contrivings, deviſings, deſignings, yea the ſimple and ſingle thinkings of the heart. Theſe are not only the moulds and principles of every work, but every one of theſe is a work, and all of them the whole work of the inner man; whoſe work, or what is wrought there, is
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:104248:292"/> chiefly, as well as only, under the inſpection and eye of God.</p>
                  <p>Againe, <hi>The work of a man ſhall he render unto him, &amp;c.</hi> He doth not ſay the works of another man ſhall he render to any man, but the work of a man ſhall he render to him; he that doth the work ſhall have the reward; the works of one man ſhall not be rendered to another, but every mans own works ſhall. As the faith of another man ſhall not help us, if we have no faith; <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith (who had a mighty faith) will doe us no good, if we have no faith of our own, ſo the good works of another man ſhall doe us no good if we have none of our own. And as not the good works, ſo the evill works of others, ſhall not be rendered to us. The hurtfull works of others ſhall not hurt us, if we doe no hurt. I grant we may partake of the evill works of others, yea, we may make other mens works our own, either by conſenting to them before they are done, or by approving them after they are done, or by not reproving them, when we have opportunity. In theſe and many other caſes, we may make other mens evill works our own; and ſo farre as other mens works are our own, God ſhall render them alſo unto us: Hence that caution given by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22.) <hi>Lay hands ſuddainly on no man, neither be partaker of other mens ſins, keep thy ſelf pure.</hi> They that partake (in any of thoſe wayes mentioned before, or in any other way) of any mans ſins may alſo quickly partake of his puniſhment.

                  <p>Againe, The <hi>way</hi> of a man may be conſidered in aſſociation with his ends. Every man goeth ſuch or ſuch a way for ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all end; no man takes a ſtep in any way without a purpoſe, nor doth any wiſe or good man take a ſtep in any way without a good purpoſe. Yet there is <hi>(finis operis)</hi> an end or iſſue of the work, as alſo <hi>(finis operantis)</hi> an end propoſed by the worker. And oftentimes that proves to be the end of a work which was not the end purpoſed by the worker. The end of a mans work or way, proves ſometimes better and ſometimes worſer then he propoſed. Poſſibly a man may not find according to that end of his way and work which he intended not, whether good or evill. But aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whatſoever good or evill end a man propoſeth to himſelf, when he enters upon his work or way, God will cauſe him to find accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. So that when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>God will cauſe every man to find according to his way,</hi> he intimates, that God will not only render to man according to the matter of his work, or outward path of his way, but well conſidereth every mans ſcope and intendment, or what he would have his work iſſue in, and cauſeth him to find as he findeth that to be. As the end which man propoſeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, hath a great influence upon his way, ſo upon his account with God about it. This is a good ſence. God will cauſe every man to find according to his way, both as his way is taken for the matter or courſe of his actions, as alſo ſor the ſcope and deſign of them.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve, Firſt.</p>
                  <q>Every man ſhall have according to what he hath done.</q>
                  <p>Our receivings will be according to our layings out, whether good or evill. God is ſo farre from doing any man wrong, that every man ſhall have his due reward. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.12.) <hi>Alſo to
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:104248:293"/> thee O Lord belongeth mercy, for thou renderest to every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his work.</hi> And leſt any ſhould hope to eſcape the evill which at leaſt ſome of their evill works deſerve by the ſecrecy of them, that hope is quite daſhed becauſe God is the ſearcher and ſeer not only of our works but of our hearts (<hi>Prov.</hi> 24.12.) <hi>Doth not he that pondereth the heart conſider it, and he that keepeth the ſoul, doth not he know it?</hi> (what followes?) <hi>and ſhall not he render to every man according to his works? Solomon</hi> ſpeaks in that place of ſuch as make excuſes to ſhift themſelves off from acts of charity; they will ſay, we know not whether it be ſo with him or no; poſſibly he may not be in ſuch want as he pretendeth. Take heed of theſe cloaks of covetouſneſſe, and pitifull pleas to ſave your purſes from ſhewing pity to the poor, for (ſaith <hi>Solomon) Will not God ſearch it out, and render to every man according to his worke?</hi> The holy Scripture abounds in this poynt. Read <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.19. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.12.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, how doth God render to every man his work? Is it not ſaid <hi>He juſtifieth the ungodly</hi> (Rom. 4.5.) Are the works of an ungodly man rendred to him, when he is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, it is one thing what God will do through free grace, and another what he will deale out in ſtrictneſſe of Juſtice. The Apoſtle ſpeaks in that place of the free grace of God to ſinners, not of his Juſtice againſt ſinners. Secondly, though God juſtifieth the ungodly, yet he never juſtifieth ungodlineſſe; or, though he juſtifieth a man who hath done many evill works, yea all whoſe works are evill, yet he never juſtifieth nor rewardeth the work of an evill man. Thirdly, God acts according to juſtice and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs where he juſtifieth the ungodly; he doth not ſhew fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to the ungodly in his own wrong. Acts of grace from God are not oppoſite to his Juſtice, much leſſe doe they contradict or overthrow it. He doth not juſtifie an ungodly man in himſelfe, or meerly conſidered in his ungodlineſſe, but he juſtifieth him in the righteouſneſs of another, even of Jeſus Chriſt, who hath given full ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God with reſpect to the ungodly whom he juſtifieth. Laſtly, we may ſay, that God renders the work of an ungodly man to him when he juſtifieth him; for though then he hath not done, nor ever can doe any works which deſerve
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:104248:293"/> the juſtification of his perſon; yet God doth render to him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that preſent work of faith in cloſing with the promiſe and the work of Chriſts righteouſneſſe therein tendered to him, and applyed by him for his juſtification.</p>
                  <p>Further, that other Scripture ſeems to lye in the way of this obſervation (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.10.) <hi>He hath not dealt with us after our ſins, or rewarded us according to our iniquities.</hi> How then doth God render every man his work?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer as before; Acts of mercy do not croſs acts of juſtice. When the Lord doth not deal with any man according to his ſins, it is becauſe he hath freely pardoned his ſins; and he doth not reward a man according to his iniquity, becauſe his iniquities are done away; thus he deals with all his own people, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to favour through Jeſus Chriſt; but no wicked man, no impenitent perſon in the world, ſhall have cauſe to ſay, that God hath not dealt with him according to his ſin, or hath not rewarded him according to his iniquity. There may be ſome preſent ſtops of Juſtice, through the patience of God to wicked men; their works are not alwayes preſently rendered into their boſomes, but they ſhall. God will render to every man according to his work, one way or other, one time or other; The full rendering to all men according to their works will be at the great day; in this world the godly doe not ſomtimes receive according to their good works, nor doe the wicked according to their evill works; Good men are often rewarded with ſhame and reproach, with want and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, with baniſhment and impriſonment, with tortures and with death in this preſent world; but the Lord will have a time to render to them according to their workes, though at no time for their works; ſo look upon wicked men, and their workes, they goe often unpuniſhed at the preſent, yea many of them proſper greatly (as I have had occaſion to ſhew more then once in opening this Book) they have their good things, many good things in this life, but the time will come when God will render to the wicked their work, and they ſhall be forced to ſay, that he hath cauſed them to find according to their wayes. Take two or three inferences from this generall truth.</p>
                  <p>If God will render the work of a man to him; Then</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Godly men have great encouragement to doe good, yea to abound in doing good workes. That's the Apoſtles argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:104248:294"/> (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 15.58.) <hi>Be ye ſtedfaſt and unmoveable in the worke of the Lord, foraſmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vaine in the Lord;</hi> that is, the Lord will render to every man his labour. Hence alſo that of <hi>Solomon</hi> (Eccl: 11.1.) <hi>Caſt thy bread upon the waters, for thou ſhalt find it after many dayes.</hi> Charities done in faith as an holy offering to God, produce a ſure encreaſe. To give with a right heart to the poore, is the beſt way of growing rich. For God will render to man according to that work. And as it may incourage to doe good, ſo to doe it againſt all diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. We muſt not only doe good when the Sun ſhines, when it is faire weather with us, and all men applaud us; but though men frowne and ſcorne, though (which <hi>Solomon</hi> reports as one of the great vanities of this world, <hi>Eccl:</hi> 4.4.) <hi>For a right worke, a man be envied of his neighbour;</hi> let us not hold our hand from doing good, though we are oppoſed and checkt, though we are traduced and ſlandred, though we are miſ-interpreted and have the fouleſt gloſſes put upon our faireſt workes, though men call our zeale madneſs and our circumſpect walking hypocriſie, yea though we are perſecuted and ſuffer the worſt of evills, though men caſt ſtones at us (as they did at Chriſt for his good workes) yet let us not be deterred from doing good. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever men deale with us, or what rendrings ſoever we find from the world, yet God will render to us both according to the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our worke done, and according to the uprightneſſe of our hearts in doing it. Let this provoke us not only to doe the Lords worke, but to doe it with much patience, and perſeverance, for <hi>in due time we ſhall reape if we faint not;</hi> where there hath been ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there will be reaping; and where the ſeed time hath been with teares, the harveſt or reaping time ſhall be with joy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This is a dreadfull doctrine to <hi>evill workers;</hi> Some (as the Apoſtle calls the <hi>Cretians,</hi> out of their owne Prophet) <hi>are evill beaſts, ſlow bellyes;</hi> and as they are ſlothfull, or ſlow bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes at doing good: ſo they are very free and forward, very quicke, lively, and nimble beaſts in doing evill. O how ſhould evill workers tremble at this Scripture, <hi>To every man will God render according to his worke;</hi> as a cup of cold water given to a diſciple, in the name of a diſciple, ſhall not be loſt, but have a reward, and the giver fully payd for it; (<hi>Math:</hi> 10.42.) ſo not any the leaſt evill worke, impenitently continued in, ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed.</p>
                  <pb n="567" facs="tcp:104248:294"/>
                  <p>Further, God will not render to man according to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he hath of himſelfe. (A bad man and the worſt of his workes may be good in his owne conceit; <hi>He may flatter himſelfe in his owne eyes, untill his iniquity be found to be hatefull,</hi> Pſal: 36.2.) But God will render unto man according to what his workes are in truth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God will not render to man according to the thoughts which others have of him and of his work (ſome are high in the opinion not only of the world, but of ſome Good men, they have a name to be alive while they are dead, and their workes dead workes) but God will render to man according to that cleare, certaine, and infallible knowledge, which himſelfe (by whom <hi>actions are weighed,</hi> 1 Sam: 2.3.) hath of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God will not render to man according to his good meanings, when his workes are evill; many will confeſſe they have done amiſſe, but they had good intendments in it. A right end will not excuſe us, if our way be wrong; There is no plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of meanings againſt commandements; nor will ſincerity of intentions, cover the deformity and irregularity of actions. The Apoſtle pronounceth a fearefull doome againſt thoſe who ſayd (<hi>Rom:</hi> 3.8.) <hi>Let us doe evill that good may come, whoſe damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is juſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, As God will not render according to a mans good ends, if his worke be evill; ſo remember, God will not render to man according to, his good workes, if his ends are bad. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, conſider your end when you enter your way, and begin your worke. (<hi>Pro:</hi> 21.27.) <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lord; how much more when he bringeth it with an evill mind;</hi> that is, when he hath ſome bad end in doing it; A wicked mans ſacrifice is an abomination to the Lord at the beſt, but much more when he hath baſe deſignes in his ſacrifices or holy ſervices. <hi>Herod</hi> ſayd to the wiſe men (<hi>Math:</hi> 3.8.) <hi>Goe and ſearch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently for the young child, and when ye have found him bring me word againe, that I may come and worſhip him alſo:</hi> It was a good worke to enquire after Chriſt, and worſhip him, but his end was to deſtroy him. <hi>Jezebel</hi> pretended a holy faſt, but her end was to feaſt her ſelfe with revenge upon innocent <hi>Naboth.</hi> The beſt workes of hypocrites will have an ill returne, becauſe they doe them with an evill mind. There are three ſorts of good workes, which will never turne to a good account.</p>
                  <pb n="568" facs="tcp:104248:295"/>
                  <p>Firſt, Thoſe good works which are done but for a ſeaſon; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary good workes, or the good workes of temporary profeſſors, ſuch as are deſcribed (<hi>Math:</hi> 13.5, 7.) by the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> grounds, who bring forth for a while, but afterwards fall away; ſuch good workes (I ſay) ſhall not have a good reward. If your goodneſs be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew it paſſeth away, it will doe you no good. <hi>He that endureth to the end ſhall be ſaved,</hi> and none but he (<hi>Math:</hi> 10.22.) Chriſt exhorts the Church (<hi>Rev:</hi> 3.11.) <hi>Hold that faſt which thou haſt, that no man take thy crowne.</hi> They looſe the good workes they have done, who hold not out in doing them. It will not advantage us to begin in the Spirit, if we end in the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thoſe good works which are truſted to, or boaſted of, will never make a good returne. Though a man ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue doing good all the dayes of his life, yet if he buildeth his hope upon it, <hi>his hope ſhall be cut off, and his truſt</hi> (that is, what he truſteth to) <hi>ſhall be a ſpiders web</hi> (that is, weake like that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe like that, woven out of his owne bowels) <hi>he ſhall leane upon his houſe, but it ſhall not ſtand, he ſhall hold it faſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it ſhall not endure</hi> (Job 8.14, 15.) you and your workes will periſh toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if you depend upon your workes. Good workes truſted to, are as dangerous to the ſoule, as evill workes perſevered in.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Thoſe good workes which are done for baſe ends, to ſerve men, or to compaſſe a worldly intereſt, ſhall have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from God, but that, which ſhall be upon every ſoule that ſinneth and repenteth not, anguiſh and tribulation.</p>

                  <p>We ſhould not be as meteors hanging in the ayre, ſpeaking with heſitation, poſſibly it is ſo, peradventure it is true; but (as the Apoſtle directs the <hi>Colloſſians,</hi> Chap. 2.3.) <hi>We muſt labour to grow up unto all riches of the full aſſurance of underſtanding;</hi> as there is a full aſſurance of faith in believing, &amp; of hope in waiting or expecting, ſo alſo of underſtanding in apprehending the things of God.

We have cauſe to bewayle thoſe (much more have they cauſe to bewayle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) who are but Scepticks or Queſtioneſts in Religion, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver coming to a poynt, nor able (after a due making up of their thoughts) to ſay, <hi>Thus it is, and by this we will abide,</hi> as <hi>Elihu</hi> did in the then preſent caſe, delivering himſelfe confidently, <hi>yea ſurely,</hi> or <hi>verily, verily,</hi>

Some take the word in that ſence here, as a deniall that God either hath done, or ever will condemne the innocent. There are two things wherein men doe very wickedly, with reſpect to the perſons of men, both which the Lord abhorres. Firſt, when they condemne the innocent. Secondly, when they acquit or cleare the guilty.

To pervert <hi>Judgement,</hi> is, to doe all this, for then (which <hi>Abraham</hi> aſſured himſelfe was farre from God, <hi>Gen:</hi> 18.25.) <hi>The righteous are as the wicked,</hi> that is, the righteous fare as ill as the wicked, or the wicked fare as well as the righteous. But <hi>the Almighty will not pervert Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that is, the right which belongs to any man, and therefore, he will-doe every man right.

                        </gap>hu</hi> reports and repeats the ſame matter againe; but it is no needleſſe or vaine repetition, for which Chriſt reproved the prayer of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens (<hi>Math:</hi> 6.7.) there are many repetitions in Scripture, but not one vaine one; how often ſoever the ſame truth is repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there, it hath its weight and uſe, not only as it is ſtill a truth, but as it is a truth repeated. And therefore I ſhall give a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold reaſon why this truth is here againe repeated, which will alſo lead us to a fuller improvement of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe this truth is (as it were) the hinge upon which the whole controverſie between <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Elihu</hi> is turned. <hi>Job</hi> was unſatisfied becauſe he was ſo ill handled, and therefore <hi>Elihu</hi> tells him often that God is righteous, and that he will not wrong any man. Hereby giving <hi>Job</hi> to underſtand, that God had done him nothing, or done nothing to him, but right. Such grand ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing controling truths ſhould be often, and can ſcarce be too often repeated.</p>
                  <pb n="572" facs="tcp:104248:297"/>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Elihu</hi> repeated this againe, becauſe 'tis ſuch a truth, as no man can too much, no nor enough weigh and conſider the value and worth of it. Now, that which cannot be too often nor too much thought of, cannot (if rules of prudence be obſerved) be too much or too often ſpoken of. There is ſcarce any man who hath not ſometimes at leaſt indirectly and obliquely ſome hard thoughts of the proceedings of God, either in reference to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe or to others; Nor is there any thing that we have more temptations about, then that, ſurely, we are not in all things right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealt with, and that the diſpenſations of God are not ſo even, as they might. Theſe ſinfull ſuſpicions are dayly moving and fluctuating in the heart of man, and therefore this oppoſite prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple ought to be faſtened and fixed there to the utmoſt, that the will and workes of God are all juſt and righteous, yea that his will is the rule of all righteous workings; or, that as whatſoever is done in this world, is done by the diſpoſure of God, ſo God (though the thing be evill and unjuſt) is juſt and good in the diſpoſure of it. Therefore unleſſe we reſiſt or contradict the will of God, we muſt ſay, whatſoever comes to paſſe, comes righteouſly to paſſe, becauſe it comes to paſſe by the determinate will and counſell of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Elihu</hi> repeates this aſſertion, that he might the more commodiouſly make his tranſition or paſſage to the matter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and proſecute it with greater ſucceſſe. And therefore I ſhall not ſtay longer upon thoſe words, only.</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This great truth, that <hi>God will not doe wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert Judgement,</hi> convinceth thoſe, not only of injudiciouſneſſe, but of wickedneſſe, who, though they are ready to acknowledge in generall, <hi>God is juſt,</hi> yet as to thoſe particular providences, which concerne them, or wherewith themſelves are pincht, doe not, cannot acquieſce and reſt in the will of God, with freedome and ſatisfaction. That which is juſt ſhould not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe us, though (in it ſelfe) it be very bitter and unpleaſant to us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This truth is a ground of comfort to all the people of God, who are under heavy preſſures from this evill world, or who receive little reward or incouragement (as to ſenſe) from the good hand of God. Such are apt to ſay with the kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:104248:297"/> (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 73.13, 14.) <hi>Verily in vaine have we cleanſed our heart, and waſhed our hands in innocency, for all the day long have we been plagued, and chaſtened every morning. David</hi> was under a temptation when he was under hatches, he could hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it worth the while to take paines in cleanſing and waſhing either heart or hand while God was ſo conſtant and frequent in correcting and chaſtening him with ſo heavy a hand. Yet <hi>David</hi> ſoone after recovered out of this temptation, and concluded the Pſalme, with this particular aſſurance, (<hi>v.</hi> 28.) <hi>It is good for me to draw neere to God,</hi> as he had begun it (<hi>v.</hi> 1.) with a generall aſſurance, <hi>Truely God is good to Iſrael, even to ſuch as are of a cleane heart.</hi> God is good to thoſe who have a cleane heart, even when they are in the greateſt ſufferance of evill, and therefore they who are cleane hearted, have no reaſon at any time to ſay, nor ſhall they long ſay, they have cleanſed their heart in vaine. Though now they ſmart, yet in due ſeaſon they ſhall be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for their waſhing. <hi>The Judgements of God are ſuch,</hi>

                     <hi>as no man can fully comprehend, ſuch as no man can juſtly reprehend. The Almighty will not pervert Judgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe foure things which cauſe men to pervert Judgement, are at the furtheſt diſtance or remove from God; whereof the firſt is envie at the good condition of others. The ſecond is groundleſſe and unreaſonable love or hatred of their perſons. The third is feare of frownes from thoſe that are great, or feare of after-claps; Many are deterr'd from giving but a juſt meaſure, either of reward to good men, or puniſhment to evill men, leſt themſelves ſhould receive hard meaſure from thoſe who like nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The fourth is hope of gaine, or their private advantage. For as ſome pervert Judgement for bribes already received, ſo others for bribes promiſed, or upon expectation of ſome future favours. Now God (I ſay) is infinitely above theſe foure, and all other imaginable by-reſpects, upon which Judgement is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted every day, by the ſons of men. God is above all envy, yea above all that hatred or love which perverts Judgement; he is above all feare of evill, and hope of good. God hath nothing to feare, ſeeing none can reach him, much leſſe hurt him; neither hath he any thing at all to hope for, ſeeing he is in the full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of all happineſſe and bleſſedneſſe, that is, of himſelfe. Why then, or upon what account ſhould the Almighty pervert
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:104248:298"/> Judgement? ſo that, if at any time, we have any unbecoming thoughts of the Juſtice of God, either that he afflicts the good without reaſon, or proſpers the wicked againſt it; all this ariſeth from our ignorance, or the ſhortneſſe of our ſight. We have not a full or perfect proſpect of things, we ſee but a little way back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we are not wiſe to compare what's paſt with what's preſent, nor can we at all infallibly foreſee any thing future, or diſcerne what ſhall be. Whereas God at once hath all things before him, he ſeeth what is paſt as well as what is preſent, and what ſhall be hereafter, as well as what hath been, and ſo the compleatneſſe and indefectibility of his owne Juſtice in all. And when we in the great day ſhall ſee all the workes of God in the world brought and preſented together as in one view, we ſhall then ſay from the evidence of ſight, as now we ought from the evidence of faith, that the Almighty hath not in any one thing perverted Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore the Apoſtle doth moſt excellently and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitely call that day, <hi>The day of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God</hi> (Rom: 2.5.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> having ſtrongly aſſerted, with a <hi>yea ſurely,</hi> that, <hi>the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty will not pervert Judgement,</hi> yet ſtayeth not in a bare (though ſo ſtrong an) aſſertion, (which he might) but gives us the proofe and confirmation of it; as he hath denied that God will, ſo he proveth by undeniable arguments, that God will not doe wickedly, that the Almighty will not pervert Judgement. And this he doth in the next or 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, and the two that follow.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, In a way of favour, to ſee what others want (ſo we vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit the poore) or how they doe, ſo we uſually viſit the ſick, and ſometimes thoſe that are well in health.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It ſignifieth to viſit in a way of judgement, or to puniſh thoſe that have done amiſſe. Thus the Lord threatens to viſit (that is, to puniſh) the iniquity of the fathers upon the children (<hi>Exod:</hi> 20.5.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The word ſignifieth to command, to iſſue out orders, to give a charge. This ſignification of the word is very frequent both in Scripture, and in dayly uſe. Viſiters (we know) have power of Government; yea they have power over Governours to order and give them a charge, that they doe, or to examine whether they have done the duty of their place. In this latter ſence, we render it here, <hi>Who hath given him a Charge over the earth?</hi> And ſo we read it (2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 36.23.) <hi>Thus ſaith Cyrus King of Perſia, all the kingdomes of the earth hath the Lord God of
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:104248:299"/> heaven given me. And he hath charged me to build him a houſe in Jeruſalem, which is in Judah; who is there among you of all his people, The Lord his God be with him, and let him goe up.</hi> God hath charged me (ſaith <hi>Cyrus</hi>) or he hath made that my buſineſſe, a buſineſſe incumbent upon me, to build him a houſe in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that is, to further the worke, to give the <hi>Jewes</hi> leave to build the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> God hath charged me with this great truſt, and I am willing to anſwer it. The ſame thing is recorded, almoſt in the ſame words (<hi>Ezra</hi> 1.2.) <hi>Thus ſaith Cyrus King of Perſia, the Lord God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he hath Charged me to build him a houſe at Jeruſalem, which is in Judah.</hi> God giveth Princes their Charge, ſupreame ſoveraigne Princes, yea he giveth inferiour Princes and Magiſtrates, their Charge; but (ſaith <hi>Elihu) Who hath given him a Charge?</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no man. There is yet a twofold reading of this former part of the verſe, both conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thus; <hi>Who for him hath viſited the earth?</hi> As if it had been ſayd, Hath God ſet any to viſit, or to look to the earth for him, as if himſelfe ſtood by and did nothing; God uſeth the power of man, he ſets up Magiſtrates to worke for him; but he never puts the worke out of his owne hand, nor doth he need any hand to helpe him in that worke, though he uſeth many: and though he ſaith, <hi>By me</hi> (yea for me) <hi>Kings reigne,</hi> yet we may ſay with <hi>Elihu</hi> (in the notion now expreſt) <hi>Who for him hath vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited the earth?</hi> that's a good reading.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Who over him doth viſit the earth?</hi> Is God any <hi>mans Vicegerent?</hi> is he <hi>a Lord Deputy, or a Viceroy?</hi> No, there is no man viſits the earth over him, for, (as we render clearely) <hi>Who hath given him a Charge over the earth?</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>If God be an unjuſt Judge, is there any ſuperiour Judge to whom we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale for remedy or redreſſe of our injuries?</hi> Who over him viſiteth, or, <hi>who hath given him a charge over the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, over the inhabitants of the earth, or over the affayres of the earth. The Earth, by a Synecdoche of the Continent for the matter contained, is here put for all perſons and tranſactions over the face of the whole earth. Who hath layd that great Charge, the diſpoſall of all things and people in the earth upon
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:104248:299"/> God? ſurely no man on earth, no Angel in heaven, nor all of them put together. How ſhould God derive a governing power from them, who derive their very power of being from him? He go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes in his owne right, not by commiſſion or deputation.

That word is very ſignificantly uſed here for the world, becauſe the habitable part of the world, or where men inhabite, are the ſtages on which the providences of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and act moſt eminently &amp; convincingly; <hi>Who hath diſpoſed of the habitable world?</hi> which the Greekes call, <hi>The houſe of abiding:</hi> Mr <hi>Broughton, The dwelt land,</hi> that is, the land wherein men dwell.</p>
                  <p>Againe, As the earth, before, is put for the inhabitants and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of the earth; ſo whatſoever paſſeth, or is brought to
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:104248:300"/> paſſe in the world, is here called the world. <hi>Who hath diſpoſed the whole world?</hi> He that made the whole world, diſpoſeth of the whole world, providence followeth Creation.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, Is this a good Argument to prove that God is juſt, becauſe he hath the ſupreame power over all the world? Will it follow, that he adminiſtreth all things rightly, becauſe he hath a right to adminiſter all things? There ſeemes but little of Argument in this, (may ſome ſay) many have a great deale of power, who abuſe it, and they that have moſt power, uſually abuſe it moſt, and make it but a ſervant to their luſts and paſſions; therefore how is it a proofe, that the Lord is righteous and will doe no iniquity, becauſe he hath the power of all things in his hand, or is Lord over all?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer. This is a ſtrong argument, and (as I remember a good Author calls it) <hi>a peremptory argument,</hi> which can have no deniall. The Lord is righteous, becauſe he is Lord over all; he is not King of ſome corner of the World, he is not King of the whole World by election or vote of the World, he is not choſen at all, much leſſe (as many have been) by evill means and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed combinations; God is the ſupreame governer of all the world by naturall right not choyce; yet not (as ſome Princes are) by naturall right of ſucceſſion inheriting after a mortall father; but by the naturall right of creation, himſelf being the father of that world over which he is a governour. The Originall of Gods power is ſtated in himſelf; The eternall being of God, and his ſupreame authority are inſeparable.</p>
                  <p>Yea, God is not only thus ſupreame in adminiſtring Juſtice; but he is the ſumme or fullneſſe of Law and Juſtice, and therefore cannot pervert it. He whoſe power and goodneſſe gave the world its being, how ſhould he act any thing which is not good in the exerciſe of his power over the World! Jnjuſtice is the breach of a Law, but how can God break a Law who is the ſource and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all righteous Lawes? who then ſhall dare to ſuſpect God of injuſtice, or require a reaſon why he doth this or that in the world, which himſelf hath made? yea, who hath not reaſon to admire and proclaime infinite goodneſſe mixt with abſolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as in his making ſo in his ruling the world? For whoſe ſake or for fear of whom ſhould he pervert Juſtice, who hath all men alike under his power?</p>
                  <pb n="579" facs="tcp:104248:300"/>
                  <p>Earthly Judges may erre in judgment, but the Judge of all the earth cannot. God cannot doe injuſtice through ignorance or miſtake; for he is omniſcient and knoweth all things; nor can he have a will to doe unjuſtly, ſeeing his will is altogether juſt, and the rule or meaſure of all things that are juſt. As therefore he is not an idle Idol-god but moſt active in governing the World; ſo he is infinitely above the leaſt failer in the government of it. The Sun ſhall ſooner be turned into a cloud, and the morning light darken the earth, then any unrighteouſneſſe proceed from God; yea, <hi>when clouds and darkneſſe are round about him</hi> (that is, when we by reaſon either of the obſcureneſſe or afflictiveneſſe of his diſpenſations can give no account of them, yet even then) <hi>righteouſneſſe and judgment are the habitation of his Throne;</hi> that is, his governing power abides unmoveably, or conſtantly (as in a habitation) within that bleſſed line and glorious ſpheare of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. So then,<note place="margin">Ipſe quam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens eſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor tam pius eſt moderator. <hi>Hieron:</hi>
                     </note> the reaſoning of <hi>Elihu</hi> from the univerſality and independency of the governing power of God, to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and equity of his government is not only probable, but demonſtrative and unanſwerable. He is alike mighty as the ſole creator, and juſt as the ſupreame moderator of the World. If any man will preſume to charge God with perverting judgment in governing the earth, that man ſaith in effect that he hath given God a charge over the earth; And if any man be ſo impiouſly and impudently preſumptuous as to ſay that, let him come forth and anſwer this as peremptorily as truly denying queſtion of <hi>Elihu; Who hath given him a charge over the earth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>The power of God is a primitive or underived power.</q>
                  <p>His power is of himſelfe; yea, his power is himſelf; God doth not rule by Commiſſion or Deputation, all ruling power is fundamentally in him, as alſo the rule of that power, both which in God are one. Jeſus Chriſt as Mediatour rules by Commiſſion; <hi>All things</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>Math:</hi> 11.27.) <hi>are delivered to me of my Father.</hi> And againe, the Baptiſt gave this teſtimony of him (<hi>John</hi> 3.35.) <hi>The father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator receives his Charge from the Father, and he hath received a Charge over the whole earth, as Mediator. But conſider him as God, ſo the government of the
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:104248:301"/> world is fundamentally and eſſentially in him alſo. It is the higheſt honour of an earthly Prince, <hi>when</hi> (as it is ſayd of the <hi>Chaldeans (Hab:</hi> 1.7.) <hi>their Judgement and their dignity proceedeth of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> that is, when they rule in their owne right, not in the right or by the deſignement of any other. How high then is the honour of God, who ruleth not only over all the people, but over all the Princes of the earth, his Judgement and dignity proceeding pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from himſelfe!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the power of God is underived or proceeds on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from himſelfe; ſo the power of God is abſolute and unlimited. His is in the ſtricteſt ſenſe imaginable <hi>ſupreame power.</hi> Heatheniſh <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> confeſſed this truth (<hi>Dan:</hi> 4.35.) <hi>Before him</hi> (that is, before God) <hi>all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing, and he doth according to his will in the Armies of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and among the inhabitants of the earth, and none can ſtay his hand, and ſay to him what doſt thou?</hi> There's abſolute power, none can ſay, that is, none may preſume to ſay to him, <hi>What doeſt thou?</hi> no man ought to queſtion, much leſſe to quarrell at the determinations of God, whether concerning perſons or nations; 'tis his right or prerogative to doe what he will; and how much ſoever he acts by prerogative, he will doe only that which is right; we may conſider the abſolute ſupremacy of God in a five-fold exerciſe of power.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In commanding; He commandeth what he pleaſeth to be done; nor may his commands be diſputed; they muſt be obeyed, becauſe his.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In prohibiting he forbiddeth whatſoever diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him to be done. And how pleaſing, how right ſoever any thing is in our eyes, yet if he forbiddeth it, we muſt for ever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare it. We all know by our owne ſmart how dangerous it is to eate of a forbidden Tree.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In ſuffering, I meane it not of any ſuffering evill in himſelfe (God is infinitely above that) but of his ſuffering others to doe evill, or of his ſuffering any evill to be done. God may and doth permit, that which is nought, wicked, and unrighteous to be done in the world; and yet himſelfe remaines altogether holy, righteous, juſt, and good. This is a great part of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendency of his power.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In rewarding; God hath abſolute power, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:104248:301"/> Firſt, whom he will; Secondly, for what he will; Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in what kind he will; Fourthly, in what degree or meaſure he will; Fifthly, for how long he will, he can give (which none of the Princes of the earth can) everlaſting rewards.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In puniſhing; God hath abſolute power to puniſh, and the abſoluteneſs of his power in puniſhing, may be exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in thoſe five particulars, wherein his power of rewarding (in the former paragraph) was. In all theſe things we ſee the unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitedneſs of the power of God, <hi>Who hath given him a Charge over the earth? or who hath diſpoſed the whole world?</hi> Himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone doth it, and he doth it of himſelfe. And for as much as there is ſuch a ſupremacy, ſuch an abſoluteneſs of power in God, take theſe three inferences from it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, How freely ſhould we yeild our ſelves to the commands of God, not queſtioning this as unequall, nor ſaying that is hard? we are more apt to find fault with the work which God requires us to doe, then to remember that it is a great fault not to doe it. The heart of man naturally riſeth againſt the will of God; <hi>It is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be</hi> (Rom: 8.7.) the wiſdome of the fleſh thinks there is ſome unrighteouſneſſe, at leaſt ſome unreaſonableneſſe or rigour in the commands of God, and therefore ſuch wiſe men hope they have reaſon on their ſide if they omit them or act againſt them. Any man will (at leaſt he cannot but confeſſe he ought to) be ſubject unto that which is equall and right. Man hath no colour to diſobey, till he hath put ſome blot upon the command. And ſeeing the commands of him who hath the charge over all the earth in himſelfe and from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, cannot poſſibly have any blot or defect in them, let us take heed we be not found diſobeying.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Seeing God hath the Charge of all the earth, we ſhould as readily ſubmit to his diſpenſations, works and dealings, as to his commands. The Jewes of old complained (<hi>Ezek:</hi> 18.29.) <hi>The way of the Lord is not equall;</hi> They did even tell him to his face, his wayes were not equall, and therefore they would not ſubmit. The Church in captivity ſpake well (<hi>Lam:</hi> 3.28.) <hi>Out of the mouth of the moſt high proceedeth not evill and good;</hi> that is, whatſoever the Lord hath pronounced to doe or hath done concerning us, is morally good and not evill, though it be penally evill and not good. <hi>Eli</hi> ſpake wel alſo to this poynt
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:104248:302"/> (1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 3.18.) <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe what ſeemes good in his owne eyes;</hi> yet the thing which God was about to doe, was ſuch (<hi>v.</hi> 11.) as at which, <hi>both the eares of every one that heard it ſhould tingle.</hi> To have the heart quiet while the eares tingle, is pure ſubmiſſion. And any unquietneſs or murmurings at the deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God, whether reſpecting our perſons or our familyes, Churches, or Nations, are in ſome degree rebellions againſt the ſoveraigne power of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If the Lord be ſupreame, and have the charge over all the earth, then let us ſet him up as ſupreame in all things, let his ends be above our ends; let us deſigne God in all we doe; He who is over all, ought to be honoured by all. All our actions as ſo many lines ought to center in his honour, who is the Center of power. <hi>Of him and through him and to him are all things,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle (<hi>Rom:</hi> 11.36.) Becauſe all things are <hi>of him,</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, and <hi>through him,</hi> governing them, therefore all things ſhould be <hi>to him,</hi> that is, all perſons ſhould in all things they doe, yea in all things that are done, ayme at and deſigne his glory, as the Apoſtle expreſſely concludeth the verſe before cited; <hi>To whom be glory for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Whereas it is ſayd, <hi>Who hath given him a Charge over the earth? or who hath diſpoſed</hi> (not a part, or parcell, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, or corner of, but) <hi>the whole world?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>The power of God is an univerſall power.</q>
                  <p>It is extended throughout the world, to every patch and inch of it. What <hi>David</hi> ſaith of the Sun (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 19.6.) <hi>His going forth is from the end of heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it, and there is nothing hid from the heate thereof.</hi> The ſame may we ſay of the circuit of Gods power, there is nothing hid from, nor ſet beyond it. There is a four-fold univerſality of the power of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In regard of perſons (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 97.9.) <hi>Thou Lord art high above all the earth, thou art exalted farre above all Gods;</hi> that is, above the Kings and powers of the earth; whom the Scripture calleth Gods. If God hath a power over the Kings of the earth, then ſurely over the people of the earth; yea God is not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted and farre exalted above this or that God or King, but above them all; This is a ſupremacy with utmoſt univerſality.</p>
                  <pb n="583" facs="tcp:104248:302"/>
                  <p>Secondly, His power is univerſall, as to places, and nations; ſome places claime priviledge, and are exempt from the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Princes, if obnoxious perſons get thither, they are free from the courſe of the Law. There were <hi>Cities of refuge</hi> among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Sanctuaries</hi> in the dayes of old among us, where evill-doers could not be toucht. But the power of the Lord rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth all places, even to the hornes of the Altar (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 83.18.) <hi>Thou whoſe name alone is Jehovah, art moſt high over all the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, His power is univerſall, as in all places, ſo over all things; it extends to the ſtarrs of heaven, and to the fowles of the ayre, to the beaſts of the earth, and to the fiſhes of the Sea; to whatſoever moves in this world; they are all at the command of God, if he doth but ſpeake, they run and execute his will.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, His power is univerſall, in reference to time; 'tis never out, nor ſhall ever end; he is <hi>King immortall, and King e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall,</hi> his Kingdome is an everlaſting Kingdome. The power of God is an univerſall power in all theſe conſiderations: His power of Governing is of the ſame extent, as his power of creating was; that which he created at once, he governes alwayes. He did not ſet up the fabrick of this world, and then leave it to it ſelfe, but he preſerveth and ordereth all things in it. The wel-being, the orderly being of the creature, is as much of God as the being of it.</p>
                  <p>Some ſay, God made the world at firſt, and ſet all the wheeles of it a-going, but now things goe on by chance, by fortune, or by accident, at leaſt particular events are not under his government, but come to paſſe as the wiſdome or folly of men is moſt active in the production of them.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, to ſet up blind fortune, and chance, yea or the wit and policy of man, as governing the world, is to ſet up other Gods in the world; if chance and fortune, or the wit of man, governe any part of the world, then they had a part in making the world. If you divide one power, you divide the other. For thoſe inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things of God, his eternal power and God-head, are as much or as evidently ſeene, in the things which are done, as in the things which are made. 'Tis true indeed God uſeth many hands in governing, ordering, and diſpoſing the things of this world. The Princes of this world, are eminently his hand, but God doth
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:104248:303"/> not uſe any power in governing this world,<note place="margin">Non eget alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis adjutorijs ad regendum mundum qui non eguit ad fatiendum. <hi>Greg: Lib: 24. Moral: ca. 26.</hi>
                     </note> to diminiſh his owne, nor doth he withdraw his owne power, what power ſoever he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; 'tis his power that acts effectually, and gives ſucceſſe in the acting of all power. It was ſayd to that King who prided himſelfe in what he had done in the world; <hi>Shall the Axe boaſt it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him that heweth therewith, or ſhall the ſaw magnifie it ſelfe againſt him that ſhaketh it?</hi> (Iſa: 10.15.) As if the Lord had ſayd to that proud Aſſyrian Prince, <hi>Doſt thou looke upon thy ſelfe, as if thou didſt all, and governedſt all? thou art no more in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the world</hi> (though the chiefe earthly Governour of all the world) <hi>then an Axe is in the hand of him that uſeth it; And though the artificer cannot doe his worke without an Axe, though he cannot divide his Timber without a ſaw, yet I the Lord am able to doe my worke without thee.</hi> At beſt and moſt, men are but inſtruments in the hand of God; and he ſerves his owne turne by men, not to ſignifie that he cannot worke without them, nor that his worke is done either with more eaſe to himſelfe, or more ſucceſſe as to it ſelfe by their helpe (he is not ſo weake as to need helpe, nor is at all ſtrengthned by the helpe he uſeth) but only to ſhew that as he hath the command of, ſo he hath a uſe for every creature (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 7.18.) <hi>The Lord ſhall hiſſe for the fly;</hi> if God doe but hiſſe to the fly, or any creature on earth, yea to the devills in hell, they are at his call, and doe his will, though they intend it not. Further; though God can doe all himſelfe, yet he uſeth various inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that he may indear man to man, or that no man may ſay, he hath no need of another. Thus the Apoſtle argues (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 12.21.) <hi>The eye cannot ſay unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor againe the head to the feete, I have no need of you.</hi> Surely then the feete cannot ſay to the head, we have no need of thee, nor the hand to the eye, we have no need of thee. That, Creatures may ſhew their love to one another, and ſee their need of one another, God is pleaſed to give them a charge to worke and diſpoſe of the things in the world, though the charge and diſpoſure of the whole world be in himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Now if the Lord be thus inveſted with all power originally and eſſentially, then I would mind thoſe who are in power of two things, and thoſe that are under power of one.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Let them that have power remember to uſe it for God.</hi> They that have but family power ſhould uſe it for God; how much
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:104248:303"/> more they that have power over nations. (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 2.10, 11.) <hi>Be wiſe now therefore O ye Kings, be inſtructed ye Judges of the earth, ſerve the Lord with feare, and rejoyce with trembling.</hi> When he ſaith, <hi>ſerve the Lord with feare,</hi> I ſuppoſe he doth not intend it in that notion of <hi>ſerving the Lord,</hi> as ſerving him denotes our holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and obedience in generall; but when he ſaith, <hi>ſerve the Lord with feare,</hi> his meaning is, ſerve him ſo in the exerciſe of your power, and in your places, as you have power in your hand, as you have received a Charge or Commiſſion from God over this or that part of the earth, ſo ſerve him with feare, in the uſe of that power. As man ought in all the ſervice of God to be in a holy feare, ſo eſpecially when he ſerveth God in the adminiſtration of power, becauſe all power is from God. And therefore (which is the next thing I would hence mind thoſe of that are in power)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Remember, The day of account muſt needs be a ſad day to thoſe who abuſe their power to the oppreſſion of man; and chiefely to thoſe who turne their power againſt God; that is, againſt the wayes and truths of God, againſt the ſervants and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, againſt the ends and deſignes of God. God will call ſuch as have had any charge over the earth to an account, and let them who either of theſe wayes abuſe their power, conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch accounts will paſſe as they muſt give. Surely when the day of the Lord ſhall be upon ſuch <hi>Oakes and Cedars,</hi> upon <hi>ſuch mountaines and hils,</hi> as the Prophet (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 2.13, 14.) calleth the Powers and Princes of this world, they will even be forced (as he deſcribes them at the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe) <hi>to goe into the holes of the rockes, and into the caves of the earth, for feare of the Lord, and for the glory of his Majeſty, when he ariſeth to ſhake terribly the earth.</hi> It is bad to be abuſed by the power of man, but 'tis worſt for that man who abuſeth his power. <hi>Thy terribleneſſe hath deceived thee</hi> (ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Jer:</hi> 49.16.) <hi>and the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwelleſt in the clefts of the rocke, that holdest the height of the hill;</hi> that is, thou that art in high power, and alſo holdeſt thy height, thou art deceived, and thy terribleneſſe hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thee; becauſe thou haſt been able to terrifie many with thy power, therefore thou haſt preſumed that none ſhall ever terrifie or trouble thee; This vaine confidence hath deceived thee, for (as it followeth in the latter part of that verſe) <hi>though thou ſhouldeſt make thy neſt as high as the Eagle, I will bring thee
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:104248:304"/> downe from thence, ſaith the Lord;</hi> that is, I will bring thee to a reckoning for terrifying thoſe with thy power whom thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt have protected by it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, This is matter of great Comfort to all good men who are under power; though rhey are wronged and oppreſſed by the power of man, this may ſupport them, God hath power over all the earth, he hath the Charge, and he will ſee them righted one time or other. (<hi>Eccleſ:</hi> 3.16, 17.) <hi>Moreover, I ſaw under the Sun the place of Judgement, that wickedneſſe was there, and the place of righteouſneſſe, that iniquity was there; I ſaid in mine heart, God ſhall judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry purpoſe and for every worke.</hi> And if for every purpoſe and worke, then ſurely for this, the reviewing of the unrighteous judgements of the Princes and Powers of the earth, who hold the places of Judgement and righteouſneſſe; to puniſh the pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, the Lord who is Prince of the Kings of the earth often <hi>powreth contempt upon Princes</hi> (Pſal: 107.40, 41.) <hi>and cauſeth them to wander in the wilderneſſe where there is no way; yet ſetteth he the poore on high from affliction, and maketh him familyes like a flocke.</hi> For as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 138.6, 7.) <hi>Though the Lord be high, yet hath he regard to the lowly, but the proud he knoweth a farr of;</hi> hereupon his faith riſeth up to a full aſſurance in the next verſe; <hi>Though I walke in the midſt of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou ſhalt ſtretch forth thine hand againſt the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand ſhall ſave me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much for the argument here uſed, the Lord is righteous, for he hath all power in his hand; and he hath no reaſon upon any account in the world to pervert power; yea for him to doe any thing that is not righteous, were to act againſt himſelfe, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his owne being and bleſſedneſſe, who is God bleſſed for evermore.</p>

               <p>IN theſe two verſes <hi>Elihu</hi> perfects the proofe of what he lately aſſerted, that <hi>God is juſt, and that there is no unrighteouſneſſe in him</hi> (v. 12.) <hi>yea ſurely God will not doe wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert Judgement;</hi> For, as <hi>Moſes</hi> in his dying ſong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes him; <hi>He is the rocke, his worke is perfect; for all his wayes are judgement; a God of truth, and without iniquity, juſt and right is he.</hi> The firſt argument for the confirmation of this was opened at the 13 verſe. And it was grounded upon the abſoluteneſs and univerſality of his dominion: Here we have a ſecond argument from the ſweet temperament of his power and goodneſs. God hath power enough in his hand at once to deſtroy all fleſh, and to command every man back into the duſt. But he doth not thus put out his power.

It ſignifieth to have deep and ſerious thoughts, to think with conſideration and attention, yea with ſome height and heat of affection. And all this whether that thing which the heart and affections are ſet upon, pleaſe or diſpleaſe, be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table or grievous; for both love and hatred, hope and feare, are thoughtfull of, and ſollicitous about their ſeverall objects. Hence
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:104248:305"/> that caution (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 62.10.) <hi>If riches encreaſe ſet not your heart upon them;</hi> we naturally love riches, and therefore as naturally ſpend many thoughts, both how to get and how to keepe them. If a man have riches, or an encreaſe of riches, it is not unlawfull for him to thinke or them, (yet we ſhould be as ſparing of our thoughts that way as can be, our thoughts and the bent of our ſoules ſhould alwayes be upon God) but that which the Pſalmiſt forbids is the ſetling of our hearts; As if he had ſayd, <hi>Let not your thoughts ſtay or dwell there.</hi> Riches are themſelves tranſient things, therefore they ſhould have but our tranſient thoughts. <hi>Set not your hearts upon them,</hi> for they may quickly be unſetled. <hi>Samuel</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpake <hi>Saul</hi> in the ſame language about a worldly concernment, when he went out to ſeek his fathers Aſſes (1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 9.20.) <hi>Set not thy mind on them.</hi> 'Tis like <hi>Saul</hi> was over-burdened with this thought, What's become of, or what ſhall I doe for my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Aſſes? Be not ſollicitous about them, ſaith <hi>Samuel,</hi> greater things are towards thee. <hi>Abigail</hi> uſeth the ſame forme of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>David</hi> concerning <hi>Naball</hi> (1 Sam: 25.23.) <hi>Let not my Lord regard this man of Belial,</hi> lay not to heart what <hi>Nabal</hi> hath ſayd or done. Thus <hi>Jonadab</hi> took off <hi>Davids</hi> feare, that in one day he had been deprived of all his Sons (2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 13.33.) <hi>Now therefore let not my Lord the King take the thing to heart, to think that all the Kings ſons are dead, for Amnon only is dead.</hi> We are as apt to ſet our heart upon our loſſes, as upon our enjoyments. And to ſhew how little <hi>Pharoah</hi> regarded the heavy hand of God upon him, it is ſayd (after <hi>Moſes</hi> had turned all the waters that were in the river to blood, <hi>Exod:</hi> 7.23.) <hi>And Pharoah turned and went into his houſe, neither did ſet his heart to this alſo;</hi> That is, he ſlighted what God had done.

                  <pb n="589" facs="tcp:104248:305"/>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>If he ſet his heart againſt man,</hi> to enquire ſtrictly into his life and wayes, if he ſhould critically mark all his errours, or faults, and ſo reſolve to proceed againſt him, he might ſoon make an end of him, as it followeth in the next verſe. As the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, ſo the beſt and holyeſt of men are not able to ſtand before him. Thus the words are an anſwer given by <hi>Elihu</hi> to that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent requeſt of <hi>Job,</hi> that God would let him come near to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hear his cauſe argued and debated before him, even at his Bar; but ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi> (according to this ſence) If God ſet his heart againſt man, if he doth but ſtrictly enquire into his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, courſe, and converſation, it would be ſad with him; <hi>All men muſt periſh.</hi> Thoſe two places in the Pſalmes anſwer this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation fully, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3.) <hi>If thou Lord ſhouldst mark ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, O Lord, who ſhould ſtand?</hi> That is, No man ſhall; We cannot ſtand in our righteouſneſs before God, how then ſhall we ſtand in our iniquities! And therefore the ſecond Text depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the Lord's ſevere enquiry into our pureſt and moſt perfect ſervices, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2.) <hi>Enter not into judgement with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living be juſtified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>If he ſet his heart againſt man,</hi> that is, If he have a general purpoſe to deſtroy and ruine him by his abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, he can eaſily do it; what God hath a minde to do, or only willeth it to be done, he hath power enough to do it: He can make any man miſerable, and not only ſtrip him of the comforts of this life, but of his life too: And as he hath power enough, if he would uſe it, ſo he hath ſoveraign unqueſtionable authority enough to bear him out in the uſe of his power. Now, ſeeing God who is cloathed with this abſolute power, yet doth not exerciſe ſuch a power, but having given man a being, continues to very many men a comfortable being in this world, and doth not willingly grieve or afflict any of the children of men, nor execute any ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon them without their deſert; ſurely then God is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, he will not do wickedly. Thus we have the importance of the Tranſlation, <hi>If he ſet his heart againſt man:</hi> We ſay, (which alſo beareth fairly enough the ſame ſence) <hi>If he ſet his heart upon man.</hi>

                     </note> ſpirit and breath (Some inſiſt much and curiouſly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this diſtinction) The ſpirit denoting the ſoul or the internal rational power of man, and the breath that effect of life which followeth or floweth from the union of ſoul and body. The life of man is often expreſſed by <hi>breath; Ceaſe ye from man, whoſe breath</hi> (or life) <hi>is in his noſtrils;</hi> (Iſa. 2.22.) If once man's breath goeth out, his life cannot ſtay behinde; the ſpirit of a man is in this ſence diſtinct from his breath; for when the breath is vaniſhed, and is no more, the ſoul or ſpirit liveth. The Apoſtle in his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the Theſſalonians (1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23.) puts <hi>ſoul and ſpirit</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>The very God of peace ſanctifie you wholly, and I pray God, your whole ſpirit, and ſoul, and body, be preſerved harmleſs unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> There ('tis moſt probable) by the ſoul, he intends the inferiour powers in man, or his affections, and by the ſpirit, his higher powers of reaſon and underſtanding: yet the ſpirit is often put for that whole part of man which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinct to his body. <hi>Into thy hands I commend my ſpirit:</hi> that is, my ſoul, not forgetting my body: And I conceive, we may ſafely expound it here in that latitude, as comprehending the whole inner man. Yet it is all one, as to the ſence of this place, whether we take ſpirit and breath diſtinctly or for the ſame; the ſpirit being ſo called from ſpiration or breathing; <hi>If he gather unto him his ſpirit, and his breath.</hi> The gathering of the ſpirit and breath of man unto God, is but a periphraſis or circumlocution of
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:104248:306"/> death, or of man's departure out of this life; when man was formed or created (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7.) it is ſaid, <hi>God breathed into him the breath of life, and man became a living ſoul:</hi> And when man dyeth, his breath or ſpirit may be ſaid to be gathered or returned back unto God; ſo then, the meaning of <hi>Elihu</hi> in this double ſuppoſition, <hi>(If he ſet his heart upon man, if he he gather to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf his ſpirit and his breath,)</hi> is clearly this, if God were once reſolved, or ſhould but ſay the word, that man muſt preſently die, die he muſt, and that preſently.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note,
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> God can eaſily do whatſoever he hath a minde to do.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If he do put his heart upon the doing of any thing, it is done; Men often ſet their hearts, yea and their hands unto that which they cannot do; if men could do that which they ſet their hearts to do, or have a minde to do, and thereupon ſet their hands to do, we ſhould have ſtrange work in the world. 'Tis a mercy to many men, that man is often fruſtrated in his thoughts and purpoſes, in his attempts and undertakings; and 'tis a glorious mercy to all that have an intereſt in God, that God never loſt a thought, nor can be hindred in any work he ſetteth his heart upon. He that can lett or ſtop all men in their works, can work, and none ſhall lett or ſtop him. What God will do, is not defecible or undoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able (if I may ſo expreſs it) by any power in heaven or earth. And as God can do what he will, and ask no man leave, ſo he can do what he will without trouble to himſelf; 'tis but the reſolve of his will, the turning of his hand, or the caſt of his eye (all which are ſoon diſpatcht) and 'tis done. Thus God breathed out his wiſhes for the welfare of Iſrael, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.13.) <hi>O that my people had hearkned unto me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I ſhould ſoon have ſubdued the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e ſpeedily done, then the <hi>turning of a hand?</hi> Many things are hard to man, (and indeed very few things are eaſie to him, except it be to ſin, or to do evil, he can do evil eaſily) ſome things are not only hard, but too hard, impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for man; but there is nothing hard, much leſs too hard for God, he can eaſily do the hardeſt things; yea, the hardeſt things
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:104248:307"/> are as eaſie to him as the eaſieſt; for as (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.12.) <hi>Darkneſs hideth not from the ſight of God, the darkneſs and the light are both alike to him;</hi> ſo hardneſs hinders not the work of God, hardneſs and eaſineſs are both alike to him, if he ſet his heart upon it. From this general truth, take two inferences.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, How ſhould we fear before this God? How ſhould we tremble at the remembrance of, and walk humbly (in our higheſt aſſurance) with this God? We are much afraid to diſpleaſe thoſe men who can eaſily hurt us, and in whoſe hand it is to ruine us every hour: But O how little are we in this thought to fear the Lord, to take heed of diſpleaſing the Lord, who can with eaſe either help or hurt, either bring ſalvation or deſtruction, who in a moment can thruſt the ſoul out of the body, and caſt both into hell.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may hence make a ſtrong inference for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the people of God, when their ſtraits are moſt pinching, and their difficulties look like impoſſibilities, and are ſo indeed, while they look to man; when their enemies are ſtrongeſt, and the mountains which ſtand in the way of their expected comforts greateſt, if then God will be entreated to ſet his heart, and caſt his eye upon them, their ſtraits are preſently turned into enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, difficulties become eaſie, and mountains plains. If we can but engage the Lord, (his own promiſe is the ſureſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, and indeed all that we can put upon him, or minde him of, if (I ſay) we can thus engage the Lord) to be with us, who can be (to our hurt, many will be to their own) againſt us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly Note.</p>
                  <q>Our life is at the beck, diſpoſe and pleaſure of God.</q>
                  <p>He can gather the ſpirit and the breath to himſelf whenſoever he pleaſeth; (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.29.) <hi>Thou hideſt thy face and they are troubled, and thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their duſt.</hi> If God hideth his face from us, 'tis death while we live; but if he take away our breath, we cannot live, but die. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.3.) <hi>Thou turneſt man to deſtruction, and ſayeſt, Return ye children of men.</hi> Here's man turning and returning upon the ſaying of God; man turneth to death, he returneth to duſt, and ſhall at laſt return from the duſt, and all this when God ſaith he muſt. Our life is a very frail thing, and it is in the hand of God
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:104248:307"/> to continue or take it away; to let us hold it, or gather it home to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From the manner of ſpeaking, <hi>If he gather to himſelf his ſpirit and his breath;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>When man dieth, he is gathered to God.</q>
                  <p>When (as <hi>Solomon</hi> allegorizeth the death of man, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.6, 7.) <hi>The ſilver cord is looſed, and the golden bowl broken,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then ſhall the duſt</hi> (that is, the body) <hi>return to the earth as it was, and the ſpirit ſhall return to God who gave it;</hi> that is, each part of man (when he departeth this world) ſhall go its proper way, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to that which is moſt congenial to it; his body to the earth, from whence it is; his ſoul to God, of whom it is. God is a Spirit, the creating Spirit, and our created <hi>ſpirits are gathered to God when they are ſeparated from the body;</hi> yet remember there is a two-fold gathering or returning of the ſpirit to God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To abide and be bleſſed with him for ever; thus the ſpirits of believers or ſaints only are gathered to God when they depart out of this world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a gathering of the ſpirit to God, to be judged and diſpoſed of by him, to receive a ſentence of life or death from him. And thus the ſpirit of every man or woman that dieth, is gathered to God, be they good or bad, believers or unbelievers, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27.) <hi>It is appointed for men once to die, but after this the judgement.</hi> 'Tis the Statute Law of God, man muſt die, and the ſound of Judgement is at the heels of death. That Text ſaith, <hi>but after this the Judgement.</hi> The general day of judgement ſhall not be till the reſurrection of man from the dead; But there is a perſonal judgement, or a determining of every mans ſtate when he dieth; and for that end every mans ſpirit is gathered to God to receive his ſentence. The ſpirits of wicked men are gathered to him and condemned, the ſpirits of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous are gathered to him and acquitted: We are come, ſaith the Apoſtle (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23.) <hi>to God, the Judge of all, and to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect. David</hi> knew he muſt be gathered to God, but he earneſtly deprecated ſuch a gathering as moſt ſhall have, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.9.) <hi>Gather not my ſoul with ſinners, nor my life with bloody men.</hi> It is this word, when ſinners die, they are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered;
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:104248:308"/> but <hi>David</hi> would not be gathered as they are gathered; They are gathered to God, but it is that they may be for ever ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from him; they are gathered to a day of vengeance and wrath: Therefore <hi>David</hi> prayed, <hi>Gather not my ſoul with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Death is called a gathering in a threefold reference.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>A gathering to our people.</hi> Thus it is ſaid of <hi>Aaron,</hi> (Num. 20.24.) <hi>Aaron ſhall be gathered unto his people, for he ſhall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the land,</hi> &amp;c. Death ſeparates the people of God from their people, that is, from thoſe that are like them on earth, but it will be a means of bringing them into the ſociety of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or fellow believers who are gone before them into heaven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Death is called <hi>a gathering to our Fathers,</hi> (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34:28.) <hi>Behold I will gather thee to thy Fathers, and thou ſhalt be gathered to thy grave in peace.</hi> There's a gathering to a more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial company, and that with other like Scriptures are an argument that we ſhall know our relations in heaven. For, <hi>to be gathered to our Fathers,</hi> ſpoken of in the firſt part of the verſe, is more then to be gathered to the grave, ſpoken of in the latter; and by our fathers, we are to underſtand more of our fathers then the grave hath in its keeping (which is but their bodies) even their ſouls, which are kept in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, According to the phraſe of this Text, death is called a gathering to God; <hi>If he gather unto himſelf his ſpirit and his breath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence Note, Fourthly.</p>
                  <q>The ſpirit or ſoul of man hath its original from God.</q>
                  <p>It is of him to whom it returneth; The ſoul or ſpirit of man is of God in a more ſpecial way then his body is; for though God giveth both, yet the Scripture (in the place before named) ſpeaks of the ſoul as the gift of God, but paſſeth by the body; (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.7.) <hi>The duſt ſhall return to the earth, as it was; and the ſpirit ſhall return to God who gave it.</hi> 'Tis God, not man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, who hath given us theſe bodies, but 'tis not man, but God alone who hath given us theſe ſpirits; therefore men are called <hi>the fathers of our fleſh,</hi> that is, of the body, in way of diſtinction, from God, <hi>who is the father of ſpirits</hi> (Heb. 12.9.) <hi>We have had fathers of our fleſh, which corrected us, and we gave them reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſhall we not much rather be in ſubjection to the Father of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:104248:308"/> and live;</hi> that is, ſhall we not rather be ſubject to God then to man? Father of ſpirits is an Attribute or Title too high and honourable for any but God. One of the Ancients in his gracious breathing after God, brake out into this holy Paſſion; <hi>My ſoul (O God) came from thee, and my heart is unquiet or reſtleſs until it return to thee again;</hi> God is our center, and our reſt: He gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to himſelf mans ſpirit; and when he doth ſo, what then? what's the iſſue of it? <hi>Elihu</hi> tells us what in the next verſe,</p>

                     <hi>All fleſh,</hi> that is, every man, be he who he will, <hi>ſhall periſh.</hi> Thus as <hi>all fleſh</hi> is reſtrained to man, ſo it extendeth over all men, yea over all things of man (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.6.) <hi>All fleſh is graſs, and all the goodlineſs thereof as the flower of the field;</hi> that is, all men are periſhing, and all that man hath, meerly as a man, is as fading and periſhing as himſelf is.</p>
                  <p>Some take notice, that man was not called fleſh till after his fall; It's ſaid before, when God ſet him up in that primitive pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Creation, <hi>Man became a living ſoul.</hi> He was not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of at firſt as <hi>fleſh,</hi> but as a <hi>living ſoul, (Gen.</hi> 2.7.) but as ſoon as man had ſinned, he was called <hi>fleſh,</hi> as if he had no ſoul. There may two other reaſons be given why man is called fleſh, both fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing from the former. Firſt, Becauſe man ſince his fall doth
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:104248:309"/> moſt for his fleſh, and neglects his ſoul altogether, till being planted into the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> he is brought out of that wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed condition into which he fell by and with the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, He is called fleſh, becauſe, ſince the fall man is become weak and frail, both as to Naturals and Morals, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3.) <hi>My ſpirit ſhall not alwaies ſtrive with man, for that he alſo is fleſh:</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Now man declareth himſelf to be fleſh indeed, he acts like an impotent ſorry creature, he acts as if he ſcarce had a ſoul in him, as if he were no more then the beaſts of the earth: My ſpirit ſhall not alwaies ſtrive with man, for that he alſo is fleſh;</hi> and therefore (<hi>v.</hi> 30.) God told <hi>Noah, The end of all fleſh is come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me;</hi> that is, Man, and all his worldly glory, ſhall all be ſwept away with a deluge of water, as here,
<q>All fleſh ſhall periſh together.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a two-fold periſhing; Firſt, By way of annihilation. Secondly, By way of tranſmutation. When <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, all fleſh ſhall periſh, we are not to underſtand it of annihilating all fleſh; (God can do that, he can turn man back into that nothing out of which he was made) but the periſhing in the Text importeth only a change. Death is called a change, &amp; a change to periſhing, as that good &amp; great woman ſaid, <hi>I will go in unto the King, and if I periſh, I periſh,</hi> (Heſt. 4.16.) that is, <hi>If I die, I die.</hi> The Prophet la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.1.) <hi>The righteous periſheth, and no man layeth it to heart. All fleſh ſhall periſh</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Again, We may take the word <hi>together,</hi> for <hi>all at once,</hi> God can make a total devaſtation in the earth, and ſweep all away as
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:104248:309"/> filth with the beſome of deſtruction; He can deſtroy all the world, of all men, who are the chiefe part of the world, together, or at one blow; ſo that (as the Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Chap:</hi> 1.9.) <hi>Affliction ſhall not riſe up a ſecond time.

                     <q>And man ſhall returne againe unto duſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or he ſhall goe backe unto duſt, that is, he ſhall dye: that's the ſentence which God gave upon man when he had ſinned (<hi>Gen:</hi> 3.19.) <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat bread, till thou returne unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken, for duſt thou art, and unto dust ſhalt thou returne.</hi> Man was duſt before he ſinned; yet he had not returned to duſt, if he had not turned from God by ſin. Sin brought in death, and death brings us to the duſt. <hi>All fleſh ſhall periſh together, and man ſhall returne againe unto duſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>There is no one man hath more priviledge then another, against the ſentence of death.</q>
                  <p>The Greateſt Prince dyeth as ſoone as the meaneſt peaſant. Death can as ſoone and as eaſily breake into the ſtrongeſt fort or tower of ſtone, as into the meaneſt cottage of reeds. <hi>High and low ſhall periſh together. Let none hope to ſecure themſelves by any thing of this world from going out of this world. Riches availe not in the day of death</hi> (Pro: 11.4.) High Titles and honours availe not, ſtrength availeth not, beauty availeth not, none of theſe can be a protection, if God ſend out a writ or ſummons to the grave. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are they who get an aſſurance of life after death, for none have an aſſurance of life againſt death.</p>
                  <p>Againe, In that death is here expreſſed under this notion of <hi>periſhing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Man is but in a periſhing condition while he is in this world.</q>
                  <p>As all the things of the world are, ſo is man, while he abideth (if I may ſay he abideth) in this world. Chriſt earneſtly exhorts (<hi>John</hi> 6.27.) <hi>Labour not for the meat that periſheth.</hi> Why ſhould we labour, that is, ſet our ſelves with our whole ſtrength and might to purſue periſhing things, ſeeing we our ſelves are periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:104248:310"/> The more periſhing we are, the more reaſon we have to looke after and labour for thoſe things which doe not, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not periſh. When the Apoſtle ſaith (1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 1.18.) <hi>We are not redeemed with corruptible things from our vaine converſation,</hi> &amp;c. He doth not inſtance in flowers or fruits of the earth, which quickly rot, but in gold and ſilver, which are the moſt durable and laſting metalls; even theſe are corruptible; but we our ſelves as to this bodyly life, are corruptible, not only as gold and ſilver, but as the moſt fading flowers and ſummer fruits of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Further, From that other deſcription of death, as 'tis called <hi>a returning againe unto duſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We learne.</p>
                  <q>Man is of the duſt.</q>
                  <p>Unleſſe man, as to his body, were of the duſt when he began to live, he could not be ſayd to returne unto duſt when he dyeth, or departs this life. Many men pore upon their pedegree, and heir minds ſwel with pride, becauſe they are of ſuch or ſuch a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſcent; but let them remember, <hi>man is of the duſt.</hi> The ſoule or ſpirit of man is indeed from above, as was ſhewed before; and the body of man is (I grant) a compound of all the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Our bodyly ſpirits (ſay Naturaliſts) are of the fire, our breath of the ayre, our blood of the water, and our fleſh and bones are moſt properly of the duſt of the earth; yet the whole body of man is denominated duſt or earth, or as the Apoſtle ſtileth it (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5.1.) 'Tis an <hi>earthly houſe; If our earthly houſe of this tabernacle were diſſolved.</hi> For though we may truely ſay, there is water, and ayre, and fire in this houſe, yet becauſe earth is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Element, the whole body beares the denomination of that. God is not ſayd to forme man of the water, or ayre, or fire, but of the duſt of the ground (<hi>Gen:</hi> 2.7.) though all thoſe as well as earth were ingredients in the compoſition and formation of mans body. As man with reſpect to his ſpiritualls and moralls, is denominated from that which is chief in him, ſo with reſpect to his naturalls. Every man hath the ſeeds and principles of all ſin in him, yet many men are knowne and expreſſed by ſome ſpeciall ſin. Thus one is called <hi>a covetous man,</hi> another <hi>a malicious man, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe covetouſneſſe and malice are their predominant ſins in practice, though the principles of all other ſins are in them.
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:104248:310"/> So for grace, one is ſayd to be <hi>a patient man,</hi> and another <hi>an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man,</hi> and a third, <hi>a ſelf-denying man.</hi> Though where any grace is all graces are, yet a godly man is knowne by that grace which acts moſt eminently and vigorouſly in him. In this notion man is ſayd to be of the duſt, and to returne to duſt, as if he were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but duſt, becauſe duſt is the predominant Element in the naturall conſtitution of man.</p>
                  <p>And if ſo, then this is an humbling conſideration. Some walke as if they thought the ground or earth not good enough for them to goe upon. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſetting forth the dreadfullneſs of famine, as a puniſhment threatned the Jewiſh nation in caſe of diſobedience, tells us it ſhall fall on all ſorts, both of men and women (<hi>Deut:</hi> 28.56.) <hi>The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to ſet the ſole of her foot upon the ground for delicate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and tenderneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Some are loth to put their feet to the ground, whereas the beſt foote that ever trod upon the ground, is duſt as wel as the ground trodden on, and 'tis <hi>but duſt to duſt</hi> when they are in the duſt, and dirt to dirt if they fall into the dirt. The Apoſtle, among other reaſons, for this alſo, calleth the body of man <hi>a vile body</hi> (Phil: 3.21.) <hi>Who ſhall change our vile body that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body.</hi> Our bodies are vile, chiefly from the contagion of ſin, that hath made them moſt vile; But they are comparatively vile, with reſpect to the very matter out of which they were all repreſentatively made when the firſt man was made, without the leaſt taint or touch of ſin. Man at beſt as to the body is but a little breathing duſt or moving clay. And did we ſpiritually look upon the matter of our bodyes, it would exceedingly humble our ſpirits, and keep them low even when like <hi>Jordan</hi> they are ready to over-flow all the banks of modeſty, and moderation. We heare of a bird, who priding himſelfe in ſpreading and peruſing his fine feathers, is preſently as it were, aſhamed by looking down upon his owne black feete. Surely did man often conſider that his whole body is of the earth, it would be an excellent meanes to keepe his heart in a lowly frame, how highly ſoever himſelfe is exalted in the earth.</p>
                  <p>And as man, while he lives is from the duſt; ſo when he dyeth (that's another humbling conſideration) his body not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth unto duſt, but turneth into duſt. <hi>David,</hi> as the figure of Chriſt cryed out (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 22.15.) <hi>Thou haſt brought me into the
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:104248:311"/> dust of death.</hi> Duſt and death are neere acquaintance, and all that dy, grow quickly into neerer acquaintance with the duſt. It is ſayd (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 103.14.) <hi>The Lord knoweth our frame, he remembreth that we are but duſt.</hi> But what advantage is that to us, that the Lord knoweth the one, and remembreth the other? I may anſwer as the Apoſtle doth to another queſtion (<hi>Rom:</hi> 3.2.) <hi>much every way,</hi> chiefly, becauſe he will pitty us and ſpare us and deale ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly with us, as conſidering how frayle we are. Now as it may be our comfort that God remembreth we are but duſt, ſo 'tis our duty to remember that we are but duſt, and that we muſt to the duſt. Shall God remember that we are duſt, and ſhall not we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it our ſelves? Did we more remember that we are duſt, we ſhould more prepare for our return to the duſt. Yea, I may ſay, we ſhould be more in heaven, if we were more in our duſt; that is, the gracious and ſerious meditation of our naturall vilenes and infirmities would provoke us to looke heaven-wards, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for heaven, where theſe our <hi>naturall</hi> bodyes ſhall become <hi>ſpirituall</hi> (1 Cor: 15.44.) that is, they ſhall be like ſpirits (though not turned into ſpirits) living without food or ſleep, living free from wearineſs and ſickneſs, from paines and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yea free from the remoteſt feare of ever dying or return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againe into duſt. Such as theſe and many more would be our ſoules advantages, did we often (as becomes us) remember that our bodyes are of the earth, and muſt ſhortly be earth againe. Thus to be earthly minded, is the way to be heavenly minded. Many are earthly minded, that is, they mind earthly things, but few mind that themſelves are earth. In what holy heights and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levations of ſpirit ſhould we be, if we could ſpiritually remember how low we once were, and how low, as to our bodyes, we within a few dayes ſhall be.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, This truth ſhould take us off from all creature-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from truſting in man. <hi>Curſed is the man</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Jer:</hi> 17.5.) <hi>that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arme.</hi> 'Tis a curſed thing for man to truſt in man, becauſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> truſt is an honour proper to God; he alone is to be truſted: And as it is a curſed, ſo it is alſo a fooliſh thing to truſt in man. <hi>David</hi> a Great Prince giveth us this counſel from God (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 146.3, 4.) <hi>Put not your truſt in Princes, nor in the ſon of man in whom there is no help; his breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth</hi> (or to his duſt) <hi>in that day
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:104248:311"/> all his thoughts periſh, happy is the man that hath the God of Jacob for his help.</hi> What can duſt do for duſt? what can duſt get by duſt? that which is weake may become ſtrong, by truſting to, or leaning upon that which is ſtrong; the weakeſt man is ſtrong enough, while he truſteth upon the ſtrong God; but if weake truſt upon weake, how ſhall it be made ſtrong. Therefore let all fleſh hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the words of the holy Prophet (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 2.21.) <hi>Ceaſe ye from man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrills; for wherein is he to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of?</hi> Man himſelfe is a <hi>ſoone-ceaſing creature (David</hi> uſeth the noune of this verbe to expreſſe himſelfe ſo, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 39.4.) and therefore we have reaſon to <hi>ceaſe from man,</hi> to ceaſe from any high eſtimation of the higheſt men, much more from any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in them. What can we aſſure our ſelves of from any man living, ſeeing he hath no aſſurance of his owne life? The Prophet would have us underſtand that, while he ſaith, <hi>his breath is in his noſtrills;</hi> Mans life is gone as ſoone as his breath is gone, and how ſoone may that be gone! <hi>David</hi> deſcribeth a proud man, <hi>puffing at his enemies</hi> (Pſal: 10.5.) He is puffed up and ſwelled with high conceits of himſelfe, as if he had ſome great matter in him, and he puffs at others as if he could do ſome great matter againſt them, forgetting that himſelfe is but (as to his being in this world) a puffe of wind, which paſſeth away. As then, we need not feare what hurt man can doe us, ſo we ſhould not hope nor have any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation from him that he by his owne power (how great ſoever his power is) can doe us any good. <hi>Wherein</hi> (as to either of theſe purpoſes) <hi>is man to be accounted of?</hi> Man is an excellent creature, a creature of high account, as bearing the image of God, his ſoul is of more worth then the gaine of the whole world (<hi>Math:</hi> 16.26.) and thus he is more to be accounted of, then all that in the world is moſt accounted of; But conſider him as to the fraylety of his life, and the poſſibility, yea probability of his ſuddaine paſſage out of this world, and then, <hi>wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi> If we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe man to God, or compare man with God, or truſt man in ſtead of God, he is as vaine and worthleſſe as any thing, a thing of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or leſſe then nothing.</p>

Now <hi>if thou haſt any thing of a ſound under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding left in thee,</hi> if there remaine yet any ſtrength in thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to apprehend the force of thoſe arguments and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which I ſhall propoſe to convince thee by, <hi>heare this.</hi> Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous underſtandings are altogether unfit to entertaine truth. As there muſt be a ſutableneſs between the ſtomack and the meat, elſe it is not digeſted, ſo between the minde and the object, elſe it cannot be received.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To the uprightneſs or impartiality of it; <hi>If thou haſt underſtanding;</hi> that is, <hi>if thou haſt an unbiaſſed underſtanding;</hi> Sometimes the affections turne aſide, and bribe the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſelf-intereſt puts a blinde upon the underſtanding. When a man hath a minde to that which is not right, he will have a minde to underſtand any thing that oppoſeth it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To the ſpirituallneſs of it, <hi>If thou haſt underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> that is, a renewed, a ſpirituall, an holy underſtanding, or the underſtanding of the holy, <hi>heare this.</hi> A man may have a great na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall underſtanding, a deep judgement, and yet be a very childe, or a man of no underſtanding in the things of God. Only a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall underſtanding is ſuited to ſpirituall things, (as the object is, ſuch muſt the faculty be) that faculty which deales a-right about ſpirituall things, muſt be a ſpirituall faculty. The Apoſtle ſpeakes concludingly (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2.14.) <hi>The natural man</hi> (that is, the man unconverted or unregenerate) <hi>perceiveth not the things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him: neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> And therefore the ſame Apoſtle profeſſeth to the <hi>Coloſſians (Chap:</hi> 1.9.) <hi>We doe not ceaſe to pray for you, and to deſire that ye might be filled, with
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:104248:313"/> the knowledge of his will, in all wiſdome, and ſpirituall underſtanding.</hi> The will of God being ſpirituall, cannot be truely knowne but by a ſpirituall underſtanding. According to this three-fold attribute of the underſtanding we may expound <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaking to <hi>Job,</hi> If thou haſt a ſpirituall underſtanding, an unbiaſſed underſtanding, a ſound underſtanding, <hi>heare this.</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and am about to ſpeake ſuch things as may call out the ſtrength, the beſt, the utmoſt line of a ſound, impartiall and ſpirituall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to ſound the bottome and the depth of them.</hi> Thus he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes him to attend, not only with his eare, but with his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, with the beſt of his underſtanding, with the beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to the things he was to ſpeake. And in this ſence the moſt of men, all bad men have no underſtanding (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 14.2.) and <hi>Job,</hi> though a good man, had much deficiency in his. <hi>If now thou haſt underſtanding, heare this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>He that hath not a right, a ſound, a ſpirituall underſtanding, can ſcarce be ſaid to have any underſtanding at all.</q>
                  <p>There are many underſtanding men, who have not this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or an underſtanding for this. While <hi>David</hi> ſaith (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 49.20.) <hi>Man that is in honour and underſtandeth not,</hi> he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, that a man aſcended to the higheſt pitch of honour, may yet be without underſtanding, that is, without a right, a ſound, a ſpirituall underſtanding; and then (as it followeth there) <hi>he is like the beaſts that periſh.</hi> Beaſts have no underſtanding at all, the rationall or intellectuall power is proper to man. A man in honour, not having this honour, a right underſtanding, may be numbred among the beaſts. <hi>If thou hast underſtanding,</hi>
                     <q>Hear this.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As if he had ſaid, I am not calling thee to hear an idle ſtory, or a trivial matter; <hi>Hear this,</hi> there is an emphaſis in the words both as to the Act and Object.</p>
                  <p>It is queſtioned what <hi>Elihu</hi> particularly intendeth by <hi>this;</hi> ſome refer it to what he had ſpoken before in <hi>Job's</hi> audience, though directed to his friends: <hi>Hear</hi> what I have ſpoken to thy friends in the former part of the chapter, in vindication of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God. Secondly, Others refer it to what <hi>Elihu</hi> was
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:104248:313"/> now about to ſay; I have not yet done, I have not yet brought out all my reaſons &amp; arguments, I have not emptied my treaſures, I have yet more to ſay, <hi>Hear this:</hi> A third ſort refer theſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatory words, <hi>hear this,</hi> in the former part of the verſe, to what he had already ſpoken, and thoſe in the latter part of the verſe, <hi>hearken to the voice of my words,</hi> to what he had yet to ſpeak; but it is not much to the matter to which we refer them, it being clear, that what he had ſaid, and what he had to ſay, was matter of weight; and ſo <hi>hear this,</hi> is emphatical, <hi>this great, this deep, this uſeful and neceſſary point of Doctrine,</hi> which I already have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or am now about to declare unto thee.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>That which we hear, we ſhould labour to underſtand.</q>
                  <p>(Col. 3.16.) <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly, in all wiſdom;</hi> It is not enough to hear the word with our ears, or to have it in our mouths, it muſt dwell in our memories, and it muſt dwell there, not in a beggerly poor faſhion, but richly; which it never doth, till we have a ſound and clear underſtanding of it, and are both in heart and life conformed to it, yea transformed into it; that is it which the Apoſtle meaneth by the dwelling of the word in us richly in all wiſdome. And he further aſſureth them (<hi>chap.</hi> 2.1, 2.) that he had a <hi>great conflict for them;</hi> that is (as we put in the Margin) he had a great <hi>fear or care of them, that their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full aſſurance of underſtanding, to the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the myſterie of God, and of the Father, and of Christ, in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge.</hi> He had held forth thoſe great myſteries, the myſterie of God conſidered eſſentially, the myſterie of the Father conſidered perſonally, the myſterie of Chriſt conſidered mediatorily; and therefore he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to get a full aſſurance of underſtanding about all theſe myſteries. When Chriſt was diſcourſing with his diſciples after his reſurrection, (<hi>Luke</hi> 24.45.) it is ſaid, <hi>He opened their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they might underſtand the Scriptures;</hi> and then they did not take in what he ſpake only at the ear, but at the heart alſo. Thus (<hi>Acts</hi> 16:14.) <hi>The Lord opened the heart of Lydia, that ſhe attended unto the things which were ſpoken of Paul;</hi> that is, he gave her an inward ear, and cauſed her to underſtand the things which he ſpake.</p>
                  <pb n="606" facs="tcp:104248:314"/>
                  <p>Secondly Note.</p>
                  <q>Whatſoever we hear is lost, and but ſcattered in the ayre, if we do not underſtand it.</q>
                  <p>Though we have it in our books, yea though we have it in our memories, 'tis loſt, if we underſtand it not; we read of a <hi>book, ſealed within, and on the back-ſide, with ſeven ſeals,</hi> (Rev. 5.1.) we read alſo (<hi>v.</hi> 4.) that <hi>John wept much, becauſe no man was found worthy to open and to read the book:</hi> That ſealing of the book was nothing elſe but the ſhutting of it up from the underſtanding; and when Chriſt opened the book, he gave the underſtanding of it: the whole book of God is a ſealed book, unleſs we have an underſtanding, or a ſaving knowledge of the truths therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. What <hi>John</hi> ſaid (<hi>Rev.</hi> 13.18.) of counting that myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious number of the Beaſt, muſt be ſaid in its proportion of the whole myſterie of godlineſs, let him that hath underſtanding count and conſider them.</p>
                  <p>Note Thirdly.</p>
                  <q>Every underſtanding is not fit to receive the Truths of God.</q>
                  <p>An unregenerate man is not fit to receive any of the Truths of God; <hi>The natural man</hi> (that is, the man who hath nothing but nature in him) <hi>perceiveth not the things of God,</hi> he hath not a ſutable faculty for them; and as a natural mans underſtanding cannot at all receive the things of God, ſo every degree of a ſpiritual under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding cannot receive all the truths of God, or not all the things of God in all their truth. The Apoſtle diſtributes perſons into ſeveral degrees, and calls ſome <hi>babes,</hi> and others <hi>grown or perfect men;</hi> that is, ſuch as have an underſtanding fit to take in and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt the higheſt and deepeſt things of God; and hence it is, that Chriſt told his diſciples (<hi>John</hi> 16.12.) who had a renewed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, only 'twas in a low degree, <hi>I have many things to ſay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now;</hi> I ſuppoſe the reaſon why Chriſt ſaith they could not bear thoſe <hi>many things,</hi> was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being <hi>many,</hi> they were too great a burden for their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, (though poſſibly there might be ſomwhat in that) but their inability of bearing thoſe many things, was chiefly in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. There are ſome truths, which though a man can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, yet he cannot bear them; and the more he remembers them,
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:104248:314"/> the leſs he can bear them; the weight and myſteriouſneſs of them even cracks his brain, till he receives more light from God, and more ſtrength of underſtanding, he cannot bear them: <hi>If thou hast underſtanding, hear this;</hi>
                     <q>And hearken to the voice of my words.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This latter part of the verſe is but the repetition or further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of the ſame thing, we had the like expreſſions <hi>chap.</hi> 33.1.8. and therefore I ſhall not ſtay upon this, only Note fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the whole.</p>
                  <q>The beginning of true wiſdome is to have a readineſs to hear, and to ſhew our ſelves teachable.</q>
                  <p>Some overween themſelves ſo much, as to matter of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that they will not be taught; they judge themſelves ſo learned, and fully inſtructed, that they will hear no more inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor learn any other leſſon, they are paſt the School; yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies they who know much in their own conceit, are leaſt knowing in truth and reality: there is nothing doth ſo much hinder the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of knowledge, as an imagination or proud prepoſſeſſion of it. <hi>The ſluggard</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 26.16.) <hi>is wiſer in his own conceit, then ſeven men that can render a reaſon:</hi> They which have leaſt reaſon, are the greateſt neglecters of it; only an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man is willing to hear, that he may gain more underſtanding. Therefore <hi>Elihu</hi> admoniſheth <hi>Job, If now thou haſt underſtanding, hear this, and hearken to the voice of my words:</hi> What <hi>Elihu</hi> would have <hi>Job</hi> hear and hearken to, followeth in the next verſe, and in thoſe which follow, to the end of the 33<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe.</p>

                     </note>The word rendered to <hi>Govern,</hi> hath a threefold ſignification in Scripture. Firſt, and moſt properly, to <hi>binde up:</hi> Secondly, by a Metaphor, to <hi>heal;</hi> becauſe there is ſo great a uſe of binding in healing; the skilful ligature of a wound, or of a broken limb, is of ſo much conſequence in Chirurgery, or the art of healing, that binding alone is put for healing; that which is well bound, is in a fair way to healing. We finde both theſe acts put together in that great promiſe of the Churches glory under the Goſpel, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.26.) <hi>Moreover the light of the Moon ſhall be as the light of the Sun,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the ſtroke of their wound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many learned Tranſlators render the word here, by binding or healing, or by binding, as it refers to healing. The Vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine gives it paſſively,<note place="margin">Numquid qui non amat judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium ſanari po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. <hi>Vulg.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Can he who doth not love right be healed?</hi> The ſence of which reading is this; <hi>God doth not uſe to heal or binde up the wounds of thoſe who hate Right or Juſtice:</hi> Why ſhould the wounds of thoſe Magiſtrates be healed, who have no care, by doing right, to heal the wounds of others? I ſhall not ſtay upon this Tranſlation, becauſe the Original Text clearly carryeth an active ſignification. And ſome who retain this ſence of the word, tranſlate it actively;<note place="margin">An etiam odio habentis judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium obligaret (<hi>ſc.</hi> vulnus.) <hi>Jun.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Shall, or will God heal him that hateth right?</hi> Surely he will not: If a man hate Juſtice, and right, how can he expect that God ſhould be a healer to him? And thus it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in reference to <hi>Job,</hi> who complained that God did not heal him of his wounds, his wounds, though great, were not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: now ſaith <hi>Elihu, Will God heal him that hateth right;</hi> that is, who doth not approve of that which is right; or, as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,<note place="margin">An etiam is qui odio habet jus obligaret vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratum. <hi>Piſc.</hi>

                     <hi>who condemneth him that is moſt just,</hi> as <hi>Elihu</hi> charged <hi>Job</hi> to have done.</p>
                  <p>Again, another renders, <hi>Will he that hateth the right heal the
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:104248:315"/> wounded?</hi> The ſence of which reading is given thus; Surely God who is ready to binde up and heal the wounds of thoſe that are afflicted when they repent, is no hater of right, no perverter of Juſtice, as thou O <hi>Job</hi> haſt ſaid God doth; ſeeing God is ready to heal the wounds, and binde up the ſores of humbled ſinners, how unjuſtly haſt thou charged him with perverting of juſtice? The Tygurine verſion gives it thus, <hi>Will he that hates right,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An qui odit ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos imitaretur. <hi>Tygur.</hi>

                     <hi>act the part of a Chirurgion?</hi> Will he binde up and heal? Doubtleſs he will not, but will rather wound and afflict, vex and trouble more and more inſtead of being a healer.

                  <p>Thirdly, The word ſignifies tropically <hi>to rule or govern;</hi>

Merc.</hi> Leges a ligan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do dicuntur.</note> and the reaſon ariſeth clearly from the proper ſignification of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that is a Ruler or a Governour, is alſo a binder and a healer: Magiſtrates binde the people that are under them to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they binde them by their Laws. Laws are as bonds, they have a binding power, they binde either to obedience or to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; and therefore Magiſtrates are binders, they binde the unruly and diſobedient, they binde with the rule of the Law, and with the penalties of the Law. When any break the rule of the Law, then they fall under the penalties of the Law, ſo that every way a Magiſtrate is a binder; and as he is a binder, ſo a healer; The Laws of Government by which people are bound, are for their healing, for the healing of their manners and corruptions; as alſo, for the healing of thoſe whom they have oppreſſed or wounded by their evil manners and corruptions. Further, all Governours ſhould, and righteous Governours will improve their power and authority for the healing of thoſe differences that ariſe among their ſubjects, or thoſe over whom they are ſet: In all theſe reſpects, Magiſtrates are <hi>healers and binders.</hi> Thus the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.6, 7.) expreſſeth them, <hi>When a man ſhall take hold of his brother, of the houſe of his father, ſaying, thou hast clothing, be thou our Ruler, and let this ruine be under thine hand:</hi> Here is a breach, a ruine in the State or Commonwealth, let this be under thy hand, do thou undertake the cure of this; but <hi>in that day ſhall he ſwear</hi> (v. 7.) <hi>I will not be a healer:</hi> We put in the margin, <hi>a binder,</hi> that is, I will not be your Governour; your caſe is ſo deſperate, and you are ſo obſtinate in your way, that I dare not
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:104248:316"/> undertake your cure, <hi>I will not be a healer to you,</hi> or <hi>I will not be your binder;</hi> or as the reaſon of his refuſal is there given by the Prophet, from his own inability or incompetency for that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; <hi>In my houſe is neither bread nor clothing, make me not a Ruler of the people.</hi> Thus the word very ſignificantly holds out the office and uſe of Governours; they are or ought to be binders or healers: the wounds of the Body politick need a healer as much as thoſe of the body natural; <hi>Governours are State-Phyſicians:</hi> and therefore we read very well, <hi>Shall he that hateth right go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern?</hi> Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> ſaith, <hi>Can a foe to Judgement rule well?</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this ſence, <hi>Elihu</hi> doth two things in this verſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He ſheweth how unfit an unjuſt perſon is to rule; this he doth in the former part of the verſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He ſheweth how unfit it is to condemn or cenſure a juſt Ruler; this he doth in the latter part of the verſe. <hi>Shall even he that hateth right govern?</hi> He ought not. And ſhall he that governeth rightly be hated? Shall he fall under unrighteous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations, who condemneth others rightly? He ſhould not. As he that is unjuſt is unfit to govern, ſo 'tis not only uncomly, but abominable to condemn a juſt Governour. This is the ſum of the whole verſe.

                  <p>What is there ſo good, but an evil man hateth it? and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is, the more he hateth it: How precious a thing is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, yet 'tis hated; (<hi>Mic.</hi> 3.1, 2.) <hi>Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Is it not for you to know judgement, who hate the good and love the evil?</hi> How precious a thing is peace? and yet there are <hi>peace-haters; My ſoul</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 120.6.) <hi>hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.</hi> How ſweet a thing is light? the light of the Goſpel, yet there are many light-haters, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20.) <hi>He that doth evil;</hi> (loving to do it) <hi>hateth the light:</hi> How precious a thing is holineſs? and yet there are <hi>holineſs-haters;</hi> how preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a thing is truth? and yet there are <hi>truth-haters;</hi> how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely precious is God? and yet there are <hi>God-haters;</hi> (Rom. 1.30.) How lovely, how deſireable is Jeſus Chriſt, both as a Saviour and as a Sanctifier? yet even Jeſus Chriſt (who hath loved us, and
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:104248:316"/> waſhed us with his own blood) is hated: There are many <hi>Chriſt-haters,</hi> as himſelf told the Jews (<hi>John</hi> 15.24.) <hi>They have both ſeen and hated both me and my Father.</hi> And if there be that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of abomination in the heart of man to hate God and Chriſt, what good is there that the heart of man may not ſet his hatred upon? <hi>Elihu</hi> ſuppoſeth that there are haters of Right and Juſtice, which are the moſt amiable things in the world, and ſhould attract the love of all perſons to them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>Shall even he that hateth right govern?</hi> How diſdainfully doth he ſpeak of ſuch?</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>To hate right is a most hateful thing.</q>
                  <p>He is not worthy the name of a man that hateth right. When the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> told <hi>Hazael</hi> what ſtrange things he ſhould do, what havock he ſhould make in the world, he ſaid (2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.13.) <hi>But what, is thy ſervant a dog, that he ſhould do this great thing?</hi> as if he had ſaid, to do ſuch a thing, renders a man as vile and contemptible as a dog: 'Tis a piece of unrighteouſneſs to reckon or number them among men, who are haters of that righteouſneſs which ſhould be exerciſed among men, and is the preſervation of mankinde; not to honour righteouſneſs is a hateful thing, not to do right at all times, and in all things, is a hateful thing; what is it then to hate right? How juſtly hateful are Juſtice haters!</p>
                  <p>Some may ſay, are there any indeed ſo bad as to hate right?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, There are ſome who profuſedly, plainly, with a bold and bare face hate the right; there is in all natural men a ſeed of this hatred, <hi>The wiſdome of the fleſh is enmity againſt God;</hi> and ſurely, if it be enmity againſt God, it muſt needs be enmity againſt all that is good; now as there is a ſeed of that enmity in every man's nature, ſo there will be the workings and fruits of that enmity in many mens lives.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I anſwer, He may be ſaid to hate right that doth not approve right, that doth not love and delight in it; not to love, not to delight in that which is right, is to hate the right. As he that doth not love God, is a hater of God; the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpeaks thus, <hi>I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, viſiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and ſhewing mercy to thouſands of
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:104248:317"/> them that love me, and keep my Commandments.</hi> Hating of God, and loving of God, divide the whole world; they that do not love God, hate him; there is no middle of participation between theſe two, between the love and hatred of God: ſo there is a hatred of Juſtice or Right in him who loves it not; though a man do not make profeſſion againſt it, yet if he hath not an affection to it, he will at laſt be found amongſt that moſt hateful company, the haters of righteouſneſs: not to hate evil, is to love it, and not to love good, is to hate it in God's account. Many ſtand as neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the dayes of this world, but in that great day of the end of the world, there will be no neuters ſeen: all ſhall ſtand in two parts, either among the ſheep or goats; and among all the ſheep there will not be one found, who hath not been a lover of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs; nor one among all the goats, who hath not been (in the judgement and eſteem of God) a hater of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They may be ſaid (in a degree) to hate right, who though they have ſome love to it, yet love it in a leſs degree then they ſhould, or leſs then they ought; <hi>a lower or leſſer degree of love, is a kinde of hatred</hi> in Scripture language: The Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſaith (<hi>Deut.</hi> 21.15, 16, 17.) <hi>If a man have two wives, one belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and another hated, and they have born him children; both the beloved and the hated, and if the firſt born ſon be hers that was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; then it ſhall be when he maketh his ſon inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the ſon of the beloved firſt-born before the ſon of the hated,</hi> &amp;c. But what doth he mean by the wife that is hated? Surely the wife that is not ſo much loved; though he loved both truly, yet not loving both in the ſame degree, he is ſaid to hate one of them: ſo I conceive that Scripture is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood (<hi>Luke</hi> 14.26.) where Chriſt gives the rule concerning Diſciple-ſhip; <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and ſiſters, yea and his own life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple:</hi> When Chriſt layeth this charge upon his Diſciples, to hate wife, and children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would he have his Diſciples turn their hatred upon thoſe relations? the rule of the Word forbids that: So then, his meaning is only this, if in caſe of following me, a man finde any ſtop or hindrance by theſe, he muſt not let out his love ſo to wife, and children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as to hinder his coming to, or following of me. Every man muſt take
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:104248:317"/> off ſo much love from theſe deareſt worldly enjoyments, as hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders men in following Chriſt; and he who through grace is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to do ſo, is in a true and clear Goſpel ſence ſaid to hate them. That which we can leave for Chriſt, we hate in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that love which we bear to Chriſt. Thus in the Text and Point, they may be ſaid to <hi>hate the right,</hi> who bear not a due proportion of love unto it; not to love righteouſneſs with higheſt &amp; warmeſt affections, is a degree of hatred. Some love the right, but they love it lightly, they love it leſs then riches and gain; and and therefore for ſelf-gain they turn aſide from, and forſake the right. Some will ſpeak fair for Juſtice, till the offer of private advantage either put out their eyes, or ſtop their mouths; he that loves not to do right to others more then to enrich himſelf, will quickly wrong others to enrich himſelf: Now he that upon any terms or conſiderations whatſoever (though it were to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage only of ſome others who are poor and diſtreſſed, much more when its for his own advantage) is drawn to pervert the right, is a hater of it. Remember, any leſſer degree of love to that which is right, may at any time be interpreted the hatred of it; and when we love it leſs then our own concernments, we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt temptations which entice us to do that which will declare a direct hatred of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From the whole tenour of theſe words, <hi>Shall he that hateth right govern?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>They that hate right, or righteouſneſs, are altogether unfit to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, or to be Governours?</q>
                  <p>Nothing is more contrary to the ſtate of Government, or the qualification of a Governour, then to hate right; righteouſneſs is the ſphear wherein he ought to walk, and never to move out of it; 'tis the buſineſs he hath to do, the trade which he hath to drive; whatſoever he doth in that capacity, he muſt be doing righteous things. So far as any man hath the power of Government in his hand, if it be but over a family, much more over a Nation, he ought to do right; <hi>Davids</hi> prayer for himſelf as a King, and for his ſon who was to ſucceed him in the Kingdom, was only and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together this, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.1.) <hi>Give the King thy judgements, O Lord, and thy righteouſneſs unto the Kings ſon;</hi> that is, teach both
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:104248:318"/> me and him what is right, give us a heart conformable to it, and a readineſs of minde alwayes to do it: That's the ſcope of his prayer when he ſaid, <hi>Give the King thy judgements, O Lord, and thy righteouſneſs to the King's ſon:</hi> Nor doth he barely pray for the gift of judgement and righteouſneſs, but he puts the ſtamp of God upon them; <hi>Give them thy judgement, and thy righteouſneſs.</hi> It is poſſible for Kings to have a judgement of their own, and a righteouſneſs of their own, which are not the judgements nor the righteouſneſs of God. For as there is a righteouſneſs of God, which ſome being ignorant of, truſt to a righteouſneſs of their own for the juſtification of their perſon; ſo there is a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God for the government of man, which ſome neglecting, uſe only a righteouſneſs of their own, both in condemning and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying other mens both perſons and cauſes; Princes being in Gods place, ſhould exalt the righteouſneſſe of God in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men. And therefore the ſame <hi>David</hi> in his dying ſong ſpake thus (2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 23.3.) <hi>He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the feare of God;</hi> who ever he is he muſt be juſt, and he muſt be juſt in the feare of God, which he can never be, but in giving out the righteouſneſſe of God; that is, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing that for righteouſneſſe, which is right according to the will of God. And if he muſt doe right thus, how ſhall he doe it, if he hate it? no man will doe that willingly or conſtantly which he hateth; he that hates right is ſo farre from doing it himſelfe, that he cannot abide others ſhould doe it. Whereas a governour, is not only to doe right himſelfe, but to appoynt others to doe it, and to ſee that they doe it, or elſe to puniſh them for not doing it. The Rulers of the earth are ſayd to <hi>beare the ſword</hi> (Rom: 13.4.) And they are ſayd <hi>to be Shields</hi> (Pſal: 47.9.) They are ſhields to protect the good, and ſwords to take vengeance of thoſe that doe evill; both which are the workes of righteouſneſſe. And if ſo, <hi>ſhall ever he that hateth right governe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And wilt thou condemne him that is moſt juſt?</q>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Fieri nè poteſt ut qui omnibus imperat, juris amans non ſit, aut quicquam injuſte agat. <hi>Merc:</hi>
                     </note>The ſcope of <hi>Elihu</hi> in the former part of the verſe was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that God is no hater of right, or righteouſneſſe, for he is not only A Governour, but The Governour, all the world over, or over all the world, and it were a moſt abſurd thing, to thinke that he ſhould be the Governour of the world, and yet be a hater
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:104248:318"/> of right; can it be imagin'd that he who ruleth all men, ſhould wrong any man? Now ſeeing God who ruleth all is alwayes moſt righteous, <hi>wilt thou (O Job) condemne him</hi> (ſaith <hi>Elihu) that is moſt juſt?</hi> God our governour is ſo farre from hating, that he is ever promoting juſtice, he that is ſo, is moſt juſt, and wilt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him that is moſt juſt?</p>

                  <p>Further, I find others joyning the word <hi>ſtrong,</hi> with the word <hi>condemne.</hi> As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſayd, <hi>Wilt thou ſo confidently, and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciouſly, condemne the juſt God? To condemne God, though but a little, to paſſe the eaſieſt ſentence of condemnation upon him is bad enough; but wilt thou ſtrongly condemne him?</hi> We render cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſcope of the place, <hi>Wilt thou condemne him that is moſt juſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> God is moſt juſt, or altogether just.</q>
                  <p>He is ſtrongly juſt, mightily juſt; as he is ſtrongly mercifull,
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:104248:319"/> putting forth a power in pardoning ſin, and ſhewing mercy, ſo he is ſtrongly juſt, or altogether juſt. The rule given to Judges by <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeakes thus, (<hi>Deut:</hi> 16.20.) <hi>That which is altogether just, ſhalt thou follow.</hi> We put in the margin, <hi>justice, justice, ſhalt thou doe;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt doe pure Juſtice, nothing but Juſtice, or juſtice without the leaſt mixture, tincture, or (if it be poſſible) without the leaſt ſhadow of injuſtice. I may ſay, <hi>juſtice, juſtice is God,</hi> that is, he is <hi>altogether juſt,</hi> ſtrongly juſt, everlaſtingly and unchangeably juſt. God is juſt under a three-fold notion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Phavor:</note>Firſt, As to be juſt is taken <hi>largely,</hi> importing a perſon accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed with concurrence of all perfections, and vertuous quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. In that ſence, I ſuppoſe, the Apoſtle uſeth the word (1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 1.9.) <hi>The law is not given for</hi> (that is, to terrifie or condemne) <hi>a just man;</hi> that is, for a man who is holy and good. Thus God is <hi>altogether just;</hi> for he hath all the lines of perfection, of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and goodneſſe centring in him, he is not only juſt and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, but juſtice and vertue it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To be juſt, imports the keeping of promiſes, and the performance of our word. He is a juſt man, who when he hath ſpoken, you may know what to have of him, and where to have him. Some give words, and you can get nothing of them but words, that's injuſtice, becauſe our words binde us and ſhould be as lawes to us. A man may chuſe whether he will make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, but when he hath promiſed, it is not in his choice, whether he will performe or no; his word bindes him. In this ſence, <hi>God is altogether just.</hi> Whatſoever word you have had from God, (and he hath given us many comfortable words for every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) God is a juſt God, and will performe it to a tittle. That Glorious and everlaſting witneſſe is borne to him by dying <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> (Joſh: 23.14.) <hi>And behold this day I am going the way of all the earth, and ye know in all your hearts, and in all your ſoules, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the Lord your God ſpake concerning you: all are come to paſſe unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof.</hi> In this ſence, God is ſayd to be, not only mercifull, but juſt in forgiving our ſins (1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9.) <hi>If we confeſſe our ſins, he is faithfull and just to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> If we confeſſe our ſins ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and believingly, deeply, humbly, and affectionately; if we confeſſe thus, he is juſt to forgive; why? becauſe he hath given
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:104248:319"/> a promiſe to forgive thoſe who make ſuch confeſſions of ſin. And thus 'tis in any other promiſe; he keepes his word, he keepes touch with man, he will not fayle nor come ſhort in the leaſt, therefore he is altogether juſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He is juſt in the ſtricteſt acception of juſtice, giving every one his due. It is poſſible for a man to be juſt in neither of the two former notions, he may neither be vertuous in his actions, nor a keeper of his word as a man, &amp; yet he may be juſt as a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, juſt as in a cauſe committed to his determination. But God is juſt in all theſe three conſiderations of a juſt man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is eminently, or altogether juſt. And I conceive, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the three is chiefely intended here; <hi>God is moſt just,</hi> that is, he never did, nor ever will, give an undue or an undeſerved ſentence upon any man.</p>
                  <p>I might ſhew diſtinctly, that God is juſt, and how juſt he is; Firſt, in rewarding thoſe that doe well; Secondly, in puniſhing thoſe that doe ill. And that becauſe he doth it; Firſt, by a law; Secondly, by a law publiſhed; Thirdly, by a law poſſible (our inability of keeping the law is conſequentiall to the giving of it; man hath drawne it upon himſelfe) though now he cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it at all, yet God is juſt in puniſhing, becauſe he ſins againſt a law that he had a power (in his head or repreſentative) to have fullfilled. Fourthly, God is juſt, becauſe the penalties which he inflicteth ſlow from a right and juſt law (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom:</hi> 7.12.) <hi>The law is holy, and juſt, and good;</hi> and therefore all the awards that are grounded upon it muſt needs be juſt too. Fifthly, he puniſheth juſtly, becauſe he never puniſheth but upon proofe, and evidence; yea he will make every mans Conſcience a witneſs againſt himſelf, or condemne him out of his own mouth. Sixthly, he puniſheth juſtly, becauſe he puniſheth impartially, neither feare, nor hope, nor favour, can divert him (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 27.11. <hi>Jer:</hi> 22.24.) Seventhly, he doth not only puniſh in a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the law, but often in a proportion to the ſin, and that not only to the meaſure of the ſin, but to the manner of the ſin; as that cruel king <hi>Adonibezek</hi> confeſſed, when himſelfe was cruelly dealt with (his thumbs and great toes being cut off, <hi>Judg:</hi> 1.7.) <hi>As I have done ſo God hath requited me:</hi> As if he had ſayd, God is juſt not only becauſe he hath puniſhed me in meaſure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my ſin, but after the very ſame manner in which I ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:104248:320"/> he hath as it were hit my ſin in the eye of all beholders; what I have done may be ſeene by what I ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Note, Secondly.</p>
                  <q>To condemne God, who is most just, is the highest poynt of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice.</q>
                  <p>Wilt thou condemne him that is moſt juſt? wilt thou do ſuch a thing? what? condemne him that is moſt juſt! How great a wickedneſſe is this, if we conſider, Firſt, that what-ever God doth, we ought to be patient under it. Secondly, that whatſoever God doth, we ought to acquieſce or reſt quietly and contentedly in it; that's more then to be patient. Thirdly, that whatſoever he doth, we ought to approve and juſtifie God in it. Fourthly, that we ought to magnifie God whatſoever he doth, though his diſpenſations are bitter, &amp; burthenſome; and if we do ſo we ſhall finde the bittereſt diſpenſations ſweete to us. Now if we ought to be patient under, to acquieſce in, to approve of, yea to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and exalt the name of God in all his dealings with us and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations concerning us, then how ſinfull is it to condemne him? What? ſhall ſuch poore creatures as we, take upon us to cenſure and condemne the workes of God! Some ſay it at leaſt in their hearts, if they had the reines of government in their hands, they would carry things evener then God doth; they would put all things right, if they might have the rule; if they might a while doe as they thinke fit, they would doe all things fitly. Some will talke thus arrogantly of their fitneſs to governe the whole world, who have not wit enough to governe their owne familyes; nor any grace at all to governe themſelves; yea they will preſume they could governe all men, who are ſcarce fit to governe a heard of ſwine, or as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes (<hi>Chap:</hi> 30.1.) <hi>to be ſet over the dogs of a mans flocke;</hi> ſuch as theſe will take upon them to governe the world, &amp; ſay they could do it better then 'tis done. Things ſhould not goe thus, if they might have their will. Though indeed (like that raſh and inconſiderate young man in the fabulous Poet, who deſired for one day at leaſt to be Charioteere to the Sun) if they might have their will, they would ſet the whole world a-fire, or put all into a flame in one day. Thus, <hi>vaine man would be wiſe</hi> (as <hi>Zophar</hi> ſayd, <hi>Chap:</hi> 11.12.) <hi>Though man be borne like a wild aſſes colt,</hi> that is, being altogether unwilling to be governed by
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:104248:320"/> any right law, he would faine give the law to and governe all; what is this but to condemne the moſt juſt? and how great, how blaſphemouſly impudent a wickedneſſe is this!</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, Did <hi>Job</hi> ever thus condemne God?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; he did not condemne him in ſo many words, he did not formally ſit upon his tribunall, and condemne God, but he ſpake ſuch words as did ſhew a condemning of God, and <hi>Elihu</hi> juſtly condemned him for ſpeaking them.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, laſtly.</p>
                  <q>Not to ſubmit freely to, or to complaine of the dealings of God, is a condemning of God.</q>
                  <p>This is a hard ſaying, we may be almoſt aſtoniſhed to heare it, what? condemne God? yeas, ſo farre as any man murmurs againſt the dealings of God, ſo farre he condemnes God. The workes of God muſt be ſubmitted to, as wel as his word, his diſpenſations muſt be obeyed as wel as his lawes and conſtitutions. Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of what he doth are cenſures of his perſon. We queſtion not only the ſoveraignty and power of God, but his very wiſdome and truth and juſtice, when we reluct againſt any of his actings or awards concerning us, though they produce our greateſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. This <hi>Elihu</hi> further aggravates in the next words; <hi>Is it fit to ſay to a King, Thou art wicked? and to Princes, Ye are ungodly?</hi> If men will be mannerly to Princes, how much more mannerly ought they to be towards God?</p>

                  <p>Thoſe words, <hi>Is it fit;</hi> are not literally and expreſly in the hebrew; and therefore ſome connect theſe two verſes immediately with the former; <hi>Wilt thou condemn him that is most just? Who ſaith to a King, O thou wicked? and to Princes, O ye ungodly?</hi> That is,<note place="margin">Qui dicit Regi Apoſtata, qui vocat Duces impios <hi>&amp;c. Vulg.</hi> An dicentem Regi O ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam, O impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be ingenuis, condemnares? <hi>Jun.</hi> Quinquennium Neronis.</note> who is ſo juſt, that he ſpares not to tell the greateſt Kings and Princes of their wickedneſs and ungodlineſs? Or as the Vulgar Tranſlation hath it, <hi>Who ſaith to a King, O thou Apoſtate?</hi> I tell thee, Thou art fallen from that Juſtice and Righteouſneſs which thou didſt once exerciſe in thy Government. It is ſaid of <hi>Nero,</hi> he had his <hi>five years</hi> wherein he govern'd excellently, but afterward he proved Apoſtate, cruelly tyrannizing over (inſtead of ruling) his people; as there are Apoſtates in Spirituals, ſo in Civils; <hi>an apoſtate is an hypocrite revealed, an hypocrite is an apoſtate vail'd:</hi> God unvails hypocrites of all ſorts, and will not fail ſooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to reprove their Apoſtacy. <hi>It is better not to be good, then not to continue good:</hi> Backſliders are worſe then they who never ſet one ſtep in the wayes of God and goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>So then, according to this reading, the ſence may be given out thus: As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid, <hi>How canſt thou (O Job!) poſſibly imagine that God ſhould be unjust, when he doth not forbear to tell the greatest Kings of their injuſtice, and convince them of it; he who calleth degenerate Kings Apoſtates, and unjust Princes wicked; he that is thus impartial in reckoning with Kings, and the mighty men of
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:104248:321"/> the earth (as indeed God hath alwaies been, and will ever be) How ſhould he be unjust? Wilt thou condemn the moſt Just? Even him who is ſo juſt, that he rebukes injuſtice whereſoever he ſindes it, and who can finde it whereſoever it is?</hi> (Pſal. 105.14.) <hi>He reproved Kings for their ſakes,</hi> (that is, for the ſake of his peculiar people, when they did them wrong,) <hi>ſaying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my Prophets no harm:</hi> implying, that he truſts Kings with that great power to protect his anointed, and to ſave his Prophets from harm; and therefore would not take it well at their hands, if they abuſed their power to hurt and afflict them. This is a good read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but I ſhall not inſiſt upon it, though ſome inſiſt much upon it, becauſe I would rather favour our own Tranſlation, and carry the Interpretation that way, as containing an argument to prove, that it is a moſt wicked thing to condemn God as unjuſt, becauſe men are ſcarce any where found ſo preſumptuous, or bold, as to ſay to a King, <hi>Thou art wicked, or to Princes, ye are ungodly. It is much eaſier for any man, much more for great men to do evil, then for others to tell them ſo: And as the faults of Princes ſeldome finde reprovers, ſo it requires a great deal of wiſdome, not to commit a fault in reproving them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Is it fit to ſay to a King thou art wicked?</q>
                  <p>Is this a comly thing? Or will Kings endure it? And if ſo, doth it become thee, O <hi>Job,</hi> to ſpeak hardly of God? Or will he endure it? <hi>Elihu</hi> did not charge <hi>Job</hi> with ſpeaking evil of God directly; but would intimate to him, that while he was ſo unquiet under the afflicting hand of God, and preſſed him ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for a further hearing of his cauſe, he did very dangerouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon his Juſtice; and that ſeeing we ſtand in awe of Kings and Soveraigne Princes, and dare not misbehave our ſelves before them, nor let fall an unreverend word concerning them, how durſt he preſume to ſpeak any thing unſeemly of God? <hi>Is it fit to ſay to a King,</hi>
                     <q>Thou art wicked.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Kings are ſupream, they are cloathed with Soveraigne power over all perſons within their Dominion; Is it therefore fit to uſe ſuch courſe language, ſuch down-right unhewen ſpeeches in
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:104248:322"/> any addreſs to them? <hi>Is it fit to ſay to a King, Thou art wicked?</hi> The original word imports the worſt ſort, the moſt infamous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong wicked men; So M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Broughton</hi> renders, <hi>Is it meet that one ſay to a King, Belial?</hi> Some give it in the Vocative caſe, Is it meet for a ſubject to ſay to his Soveraigne, <hi>O thou Belial! O thou wicked one?</hi> Dare any ſpeak thus to a King?</p>
                  <p>This word <hi>Belial</hi> is often uſed in Scripture, to note, not only a wicked man in general, but an eminently wicked man, even a man in whom all wickedneſs is (as it were) centred and ſetled, the very lees and dregs of all men, who may be called wicked. When <hi>Jezabel</hi> procured and ſuborned two falſe witneſſes againſt <hi>Naboth,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>There came in two men, children of Belial,</hi> (1 Kings 21.13.) <hi>and ſate before him: and the men of Belial witneſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, even against Naboth in the preſence of the people, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe witneſſes were perjured perſons; to tell a lye is the worſt of ſins, what then is it to ſwear a lye? no word could reach the height of this wickedneſs more fully, then to call them <hi>children of Belial.</hi> When the Lord comforted the Church with the glad tydings of the Goſpel, (<hi>Nah.</hi> 1.15.) <hi>Behold the feet of thoſe upon the mountains that preach peace; O Jeruſalem keep thy ſolemn Feaſts, perform thy Vowes;</hi> He ſubjoyns this promiſe as a reaſon, <hi>The wicked ſhall no more paſs thorow thee, he is utterly cut off:</hi> We put in the margin, <hi>Belial ſhall no more paſs thorow thee;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt then be freed from thoſe Belialiſts who formerly interrupted thy peace, by vexing and perſecuting thee, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned thy holy Aſſemblies by mixing themſelves with thee: But I give thee aſſurance the time is coming, when Belial ſhall no more trouble thee. Yea Belial is a Title ſo full of wickedneſs, that it fits the Devil himſelf, whom the Scripture brands with that black mark, <hi>The wicked one,</hi> or <hi>the evil one.</hi> The Apoſtle puts that queſtion with much holy diſdain; (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 15.) <hi>What communion hath light with darkneſs? and what concord hath Chriſt with Belial?</hi> that is, Chriſt with the Devil? They differ from the Devil only in fleſh and blood, in nature they are as bad as he, who bear his name.</p>
                  <p>This may yet further appear, if we look into the Grammatical derivation of it, Belial, is commonly expounded a man without a yoke, or a man that will not be yoked; that is, a man who will not come under command, a lawleſs perſon; ſo we tranſlate the
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:104248:322"/> Apoſtle's word, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.<note place="margin">Aliqui a <gap reason="foreign">

Now a <hi>Beliallist,</hi> will not hear of, nor have to do with the yoke; he is like the wilde Aſs deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the 39<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi> who will not be taught to plow, nor be bound in the furrow; you cannot make the wilde Aſs work like the Oxe.

                     </note> imports a perſon of no uſe, or altogether <hi>unprofitable,</hi> a man that is good for nothing, a meer unthrift, or ſpendthrift, a man that neither doth good to himſelf, nor to any others; as if he were born only to ſpoil and devour all that is before him, as if he came into the world to eat other mens labours, and not to labour that he might have to eat. Chriſt calleth the idle or ſlothful ſervant, an <hi>unprofitable ſervant,</hi> (Matth. 25.30.) and to be an unprofitable ſervant, is to be a ſon of <hi>Belial;</hi> one that hath no good in his heart, nor doth any good in his place, neither in his private nor publick capacity; neither in his own family, nor in the neighbourhood, and Nation where he lives. No man is born for himſelf, nor ought any man to live to himſelf. It were better not to live, then not to be doing good while we live. He that liveth only to profit himſelf, liveth to little purpoſe; to what purpoſe then doth he live, whoſe life is altogether unprofitable to himſelf? And indeed, he that is not in ſome reſpect or other a common good, or good to others, cannot be good, nor do any true good to himſelf; yet ſuch is the wicked man repreſented under the notion of this Text. Seeing then there are ſuch bad and baſe ſignificancies in the bowels of this word; is it ſufferable by a King? <hi>Is it fit to ſay to a King, thou art Belial, or wicked?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What can be ſaid more unfitly? What greater reproach can be caſt upon a King (who ought to be a living Law, a breathing Law, as alſo the Keeper of the Law by way of conſervation and
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:104248:323"/> protection) then to call him Belial, or one that will not keep the Law at all by way of obſervation? There are two wayes of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law, Firſt, By Conſervation; ſo Kings preſerve the Laws that they may have their free courſe to others, and be obeyed by others; in which ſence Kings are commonly called <hi>Keepers of both Tables.</hi> Secondly, By obſervation; and as in the former ſenſe 'tis the prerogative of Kings to be Keepers of the Law, ſo it is their piety and their goodneſs to be Keepers of them in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 'Tis poſſible a King may be a Keeper of the Law by Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and yet not be a Keeper of it by Obſervation; but then he ſhines moſt bright in the ſphear of his Royal Soveraignty, when he is every way a keeper of the Law of God, and (ſo far as they reſpect himſelf) of his own.</p>
                  <p>Further, Is it fit to ſay to a King, <hi>Belial?</hi> As <hi>Belial</hi> deſigns an unprofitable perſon, a man good for nothing, a man of no uſe; what? Upon the Throne, and yet of no uſe to a Nation? How high an indignity is this to Regal dignity? Kings are ſet up for the greateſt uſe, for the moſt important ſervices, even for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and advantage of mankinde, eſpecially of all within their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Dominions; as all are to ſerve them in their ſtate, ſo they count it their chiefeſt honour to advance the peace and profit of all their peaceable and profitable ſubjects: Therefore nothing can be ſaid more diſhonourably to a King then this, Thou art good for nothing, an unprofitable perſon, <hi>Belial. Is it fit to ſay to a King, Thou art wicked?</hi>

The holy Spirit of God, or God the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is called a <hi>Princely Spirit,</hi> (Pſal. 51.12.) we read it <hi>Free Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> and this free Princely Spirit of God, makes all his people of a free Princely ſpirit, of a large heart, both as to duty God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and as to charity man-wards; (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3.) <hi>In the day of thy power the people ſhall be willing;</hi> they ſhall be as Princes; they ſhall ſerve thee as ſons, not as ſlaves; a Royal Spirit is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into them by the Spirit in the day of the Power of Jeſus
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:104248:323"/> Chriſt, or when he conquers them to the obedience of himſelf. By this appellation, worldly Princes, the Princes of this world are expreſſed in ſacred language, that ſo their very names might minde them of being ſuch, and of doing ſuch things as are the ornament both of their perſons and places. Theſe two high Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in the Text, Kings and Princes, are ſomtimes taken for the ſame; and in ſtricteſt ſence, Princes are the next degree, or but one remove from Kings.</p>
                  <p>Again, There are ſome called Princes, who have the ſupreame power within their own Territories. Others are called Princes, who have a delegated or derived power from Kings. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks of ſuch, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13.) charging the Church and people of God, <hi>to ſubmit to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, whether to the King as ſupream; or unto Governours as ſent by him, for the puniſhment of evil doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well. Elihu</hi> brings in both, for the fuller confirmation of his point, and the ſtronger conviction of <hi>Job, Is it fit to ſay to a King, thou art wicked? and to Princes</hi> (who ſtand about his Throne, and ſerve him in his Government) <hi>ye are ungodly?</hi> Ye regard neither right nor reaſon, neither what's fit to be done, nor what to be adviſed? That's the ſence of the words as they are an argument from the leſs to the greater; If it be an uncomely and undecent thing (ſaith <hi>Elihu) to ſay to a King thou art wicked? and to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ye are ungodly? How much more to him that accepteth not the perſons of Princes?</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Men are not all of a rank, or all are not of an equal ſtate in this world.</q>
                  <p>This Text ſpeaks of Kings and Princes; and the moſt of men are inferiour not only to Kings, but to Princes. God hath not made man upon earth as <hi>minims</hi> in writing, all of a height; but as in the alphabet of Letters, ſome are longer and deeper then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſo in the Alphabet of mankinde, ſome men are bigger and higher then others. Kings and Princes are but men, yet they are men in a great letter, or they are among men as the <hi>Aleph</hi> among the letters, which as it is firſt in order, ſo it ſignifies a Prince, a Chief, a Leader. And if the moſt wiſe God had not ordered ſuch an inequality among men, how ſhould order have been kept
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:104248:324"/> among men? Nothing (conſidering the corruptions and luſts of men) can be more unequal then that equality which ſome have vainly contended for among men.

<pb n="627" facs="tcp:104248:324"/> height of impudence againſt him, mentioned with indignation by <hi>Elihu</hi> in the Text, he openly and to his face called him <hi>Belial,</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.5.7.) <hi>Come out thou bloody man, and thou man of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial:</hi> But we know what the iſſue was, he paid dear for it at laſt; though <hi>David</hi> forgave him at preſent, and did not ſuffer <hi>Abiſhai</hi> to take a ſudden revenge, yet upon his death-bed he delivered him over to his ſon <hi>Solomon,</hi> to deal with him as he ſhould ſee good. And ſo great is the offenſiveneſs and unfitneſs of ſpeaking thus unto a King, that the Jewes joyned it with blaſphemy againſt God himſelf. We read (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.13.) how two falſe Witneſſes came againſt <hi>Naboth,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Naboth blaſpemed God and the King;</hi> as much as to ſay, we heard <hi>Naboth</hi> ſay of the King, <hi>Belial;</hi> And as ſoon as theſe two had brought in their evidence againſt him, that he had blaſphemed God and the King, they drew him out, and ſtoned him: Blaſphemy againſt God was death by the expreſs letter of the Law, (<hi>Lev.</hi> 24.15, 16.) It was alſo death by the ſame Law for any man to curſe his Father or his Mother (<hi>Exod.</hi> 21.17.) And becauſe the King is <hi>(Pater Patriae)</hi> the father of his Country, it ſeems the curſing or blaſpheming of him, was alſo puniſhable by death. The Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> uſeth an equivalent word in the Greek (<hi>Ep.</hi> of <hi>Jude, v.</hi> 8.) reproving a wicked Sect in thoſe times; They fear not <hi>to blaſpheme, or ſpeak evil of Dignities:</hi> There is blaſphemy againſt Princes, who are titular Gods, as well as againſt the only true God. Kings are to be feared, to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, they are to be prayed for, therefore not to be reviled. <hi>Is it fit to ſay unto a King, Belial?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet this doth not ſtop the mouths of all men from telling Kings and Princes their faults, nor doth it juſtifie a ſilent diſſembling of them; much leſs doth it open the mouthes of any to dawb Kings and Princes with the untempered morter of flatteries; Kings are no more to be flattered then they are to be reproached. Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties muſt not be ſpoken evil of, yet they may be prudently and humbly told of their evils, and informed of their failings plainly. When <hi>Eliah</hi> met <hi>Ahab,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Art thou he that troubleth Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el? Eliah</hi> anſwered, (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.18.) <hi>I have not troubled Iſrael, but thou and thy fathers houſe, in that ye have forſaken the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Lord, and thou hast followed Baal.</hi> And we read how boldly <hi>Eliſha</hi> carried it to the King of Iſrael, (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.13, 14.) <hi>What have I to do with thee? Get thee to the Prophets of thy
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:104248:325"/> father, and to the Prophets of thy mother: And Eliſha ſaid, as the Lord of Hoſts liveth before whom I ſtand; Surely, were it not that I regard the preſence of Jehoſhaphat the King of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor ſee thee.</hi> Thus the Prophets dealt with much gracious ſeverity towards mighty Princes. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> feared not to ſay (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.10.) <hi>Hear the word of the Lord ye Rulers of Sodome, Give ear unto the Law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah;</hi> implying, that the Rulers of Jeruſalem were then but ſuch as the Rulers of Sodome once were, and that the people were no better then the people of Gomorrah; and it is conceived, that for this plainneſs and liberty of ſpeech, which the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> uſed toward the Princes and Rulers of Judah, he was put to death, being cut or mangled aſunder with a wooden Sawe. One might think that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did much forget himſelf, when he gave thoſe opprobrious terms to <hi>Zedekiah</hi> King of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.25.) <hi>And thou prophane wicked Prince of Iſrael, whoſe day is come, when iniquity ſhall have an end;</hi> yet he ſinned not in this harſh reproof of his ſin, becauſe commanded of God to do it, and ſpecially directed by the holy Spirit. The Prophets might not diminiſh a word, but muſt give out what God gave in. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt <hi>reproved Herod for Herodias his brother Philips wife, and for all the evils which he had done,</hi> (Luke 3.19.) And Jeſus Chriſt himſelf called <hi>Herod, Fox;</hi> (Luke 13.32.) The Prophets were often Inſtructed and Commiſſioned to propheſie againſt the <hi>mountains;</hi> that is, againſt the Princes and Powers of the world; and therefore take the ſtate of the point, and of our duty about it, in theſe few concluſions, that we may not run upon the rocks either way; neither upon the rock of blaſphemy againſt Kings and Princes on the one ſide, nor upon the rock of flattery on the other.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Power or State of Princes muſt never be reviled nor evill ſpoken of; kingly Power and Authority is alwayes to be reverenced and honoured; though the Prince be wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet his Power is to be reverenced, and that's the pureſt reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.<note place="margin">Regia per ſe dignitas, nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam non eſt colenda, etiam cum princeps iniquus eſt.</note> For to reverence the power of Princes, only, becauſe, or when they are good, and do us good, and rule every way accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our mind, this is but a piece of ſelfiſhneſs; but when Princes are evill and bring evills upon us, yet to bear reſpect to the Power and Authority which they Exerciſe; this is to honour God, and
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:104248:325"/> to give true ſubmiſſion to his ordinance. Whatſoever the perſon is, the power muſt be reverentially ſubmitted to.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is high wickedneſſe to ſpeak evill of the perſons of juſt and righteous Princes; that every man will acknowledge.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Kings and Princes muſt not be reproved for perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or private faults publickly. To doe ſo is againſt the rule in any mans caſe; much more in the caſe of Kings and Princes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Kings are not to be reproved for any of their faults, but by thoſe who have a Call to it; that was the reaſon of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which the old Prophets uſed towards Kings, they were ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially commanded and Commiſſioned by God for it, and the peril was upon their own heads if they did it not; it is not for every one to reprove Princes, but for thoſe that are called to it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Even thoſe that are called to it muſt doe it with much ſubmiſſion; though they muſt not doe it to halves and deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet they are to doe it reſpectfully. It is not fit to ſay to a King, <hi>Belial;</hi> ſuch rough and unhewne language is not for Princes: their faults muſt only be inſinuated, if that may ſerve, as <hi>Nathan</hi> dealt with <hi>David,</hi> who though he knew what his ſin was, yet he did not ſay to him, <hi>Thou murtherer, thou Adulterer,</hi> but intimated the matter by a parable, and made him covertly, or in a third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon charge himſelfe, before he charged him, or applyed the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſonally to him, with, <hi>Thou art the man.</hi> When <hi>Miriam</hi> the Siſter and <hi>Aaron</hi> the Brother of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake againſt him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> woman whom he had married (<hi>Numb:</hi> 12.1.) though they were thus neerely related, yet ſpeaking irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently of <hi>Moſes</hi> the Chiefe Magiſtrate, the Lord ſayd to them (<hi>v.</hi> 8.) <hi>Wherefore were ye not afraid to ſpeak againſt my ſervant Moſes?</hi> Yet how common is this ſin? the tongues of men walke exceeding looſly in their diſcourſes about the perſons and powers of Princes; And we every where find moſt pleaſed to heare well of themſelves, and ill of others, or to ſpeake well of themſelves, and ill of others, and the higher they are who are ſpoken of, or of whom they ſpeake evill, the more they are pleaſed both in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſpeaking evill of them. How unruly are their tongues, who cannot forbeare their rulers! Thus much of <hi>Elihu's</hi> queſtion, as it is reſolved into a Negative propoſition, <hi>It is not fit to ſay to a King, thou art ungodly.</hi> We may further conſider it as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the greater to the leſſe, to prove, That it is a moſt
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:104248:326"/> wicked thing to ſpeake a word unduely of God. <hi>Is it fit to ſay to a King, Thou are wicked? and to Princes, ye are ungodly?</hi>

                  <p>Who is that? The words are a cleare Periphraſis of God, he accepts not the perſons of Princes. As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid; the Kings and Princes of the earth, expect ſuch great reſpect from their ſubjects, that no man ſhould dare to cenſure them or ſpeake evill of them, though they doe evill, or deale unjuſtly; how much more unfit is it to ſpeake evill of God, or to charge his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with injuſtice, who never doth any evill, all whoſe wayes are not only juſt, but juſtice. He that accepteth not the perſons of Princes, who are the greateſt of men, can have neither will nor motive to deale unjuſtly with any man. I ſhall not ſtay to ſhew what it is to accept perſons? becauſe that hath been ſhewed at the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, as alſo Chapter 32.21. only I'le give it in one word; To accept perſons is to have more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the man then to the matter; and that's a very common fault among men, and as commonly condemned by God. 'Tis a received axiom, <hi>He that would or doth put on the perſon of a Judge, muſt put off the perſon of a friend;</hi> that is, he muſt not be ſway'd by any reſpect whatſoever of friendſhip, or allyance, but muſt judge purely as the cauſe deſerveth.</p>
                  <p>Nor ſhall I ſtay to urge the greatneſs of the ſin of ſpeaking any thing uncomely of God, that alſo hath been ſpoken to in many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer paſſages of this Chapter. Only from theſe words, <hi>How much leſſe to him that accepth not the perſon of Princes?</hi>

                  <p>The reaſon is, becauſe, firſt, God is infinitely more to be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced then any man.

Yet how many are there who dare not offend a man, not a great man eſpecially, either by word or deed, who are not afraid
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:104248:326"/> by both to offend and provoke the great God? O remember, the force of this text; If it be not fit to ſpeake unduely of Princes, How much leſſe of him that <hi>accepteth not the perſons of Princes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Secondly.</p>
                  <q>God is no accepter of perſons.</q>
                  <p>He hath no reſpect to Princes in prejudice to truth and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, <hi>but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe</hi> (be he never ſo poore) <hi>is accepted with him,</hi> (Acts 10.35.) and in every nation he that feareth him not, but worketh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe (be he never ſo great) is unacceptable yea abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to him. The Scripture often attributes this glory to God, (<hi>Deut:</hi> 10.17. 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 19.7. <hi>Gal:</hi> 2.6. <hi>Col:</hi> 3.25.) And as it is the glory of God, that he is no accepter of perſons, ſo it is the duty of man (<hi>Deut:</hi> 1.17.) Judgement muſt proceed and conclude with reſpect to the rule, and command of God, not with reſpect to the perſons of men, or our relations to them. <hi>Levi</hi> was highly commended for this (<hi>Deut:</hi> 33.9.) <hi>who ſayd unto his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and to his mother, I have not ſeene him; neither did he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his brethren, nor knew his owne children,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>The Scripture ſpeakes of two ſorts both of rich and poor men; There are men rich in ſpiritualls, ſuch Chriſt intimates, who are (<hi>Luke</hi> 12.20.) <hi>rich towards God,</hi> or as he ſpeakes of the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> (Rev: 2.9.) rich in grace, <hi>I know thy poverty, but thou art rich;</hi> That is, I know thou art poor in earthly pelfe, but rich in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualls. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> puts the queſtion (<hi>Chap:</hi> 2.5.) <hi>Hath not
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:104248:327"/> God choſen the poore of this world rich in faith, and heires of the kingdome.</hi> Now, it is moſt certaine, that God regardeth the rich in ſpiritualls, more then the poore in ſpiritualls, he highly regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thoſe that <hi>are poore in ſpirit,</hi> and pronounceth them <hi>bleſſed (Math:</hi> 5.3.) <hi>for theirs is the kingdome of heaven;</hi> But he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth not thoſe who are poore in ſpiritualls; not them eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who boaſt of their ſpirituall riches when they have none (they that have them are thankfull for them, they do not boaſt of them) as the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> did, of whom Chriſt ſayd (<hi>Rev:</hi> 3.16, 17.) <hi>I will ſpew thee out of my mouth, becauſe thou ſayeſt I am rich &amp; encreaſed in goods, and knoweſt not that thou art poore.</hi> Thus you ſee, there are a ſort of rich men, whom Chriſt regardeth more then the poore of that ſort. But as poore and rich are diſtinguiſhed meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by aboundance and want, by the ſmallneſs and greatneſs of their portion in the things of this world, as <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the parable were, ſo he regardeth not the rich more then the poore. When a poor man is gracious as wel as poore, God regardeth him more then any rich man who hath no grace; And when either both have grace alike, or both are alike without grace, he regardeth them both alike. When rich and poore have grace, they are both greatly regarded, and when neither of them have grace, neither of them are at all regarded by the God of all grace. Thus 'tis plaine, <hi>God regardeth the rich no more then the poore, nor the poore any whit leſſe then the rich.</hi>

                  <q>For they are all the work of his hands.</q>
                  <p>As if he had ſayd, God cannot but deal impartially with all, becauſe all are the work of his hands: what reaſon hath he to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect one more then another, ſeeing the one is no more to him then t'other, they are all the work of his hands. Man as man is <hi>the off-ſpring of God</hi> (Acts 17.28.) He is alſo <hi>the work of his hands;</hi> that is, man is made by his power; As man deſcendeth from man, ſo he is called the fruit of the womb; but as man is the off-ſpring of God, ſo he is called the worke of his hands, and his hands have wrought the poor man as well as the rich; <hi>They are all the work of his hands</hi> in a two-fold reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In their naturall conſtitution; God hath moulded them in the ſame faſhion, he hath given each of them a body and a ſoul; A body framed of the ſame parts, a ſoule conſiſting of the ſame powers.

(<hi>Prov:</hi> 22.2.) <hi>The rich and the poor meet together, the Lord is the maker of them all.</hi> He hath made them men, and he hath made them rich or poore men. There is as much of the power and wiſdome of God ſeene in making ſome men poore and others rich, as there is in making them men; yea God thinks himſelfe as much honoured in our acknowledgements that the poore with their poverty, as that the rich with all their riches, <hi>are the work of his hands.</hi>

                     <hi>Agur</hi> prayed (<hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8.) <hi>Give me neither poverty nor riches. Agur</hi> knew poverty was a gift of God as well as riches. It hath been ſaid (though prophanely) <hi>Every man is the faſhioner of his own fortune, or the contriver of his own condition.</hi> Some who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God hath made them men, think they have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves rich, or great men; and we commonly look on thoſe who fail in their worldly Eſtates, that they have made themſelves poor and low in the world. I grant, there is a ſenſe wherein men make themſelves rich, and make themſelves poor; that is, when they do either by their ſins. God is not ſo engaged in the making of a man rich, when he enricheth himſelf by his ſin, by deceiving or oppreſſing his brethren, as when he groweth rich in a way of righteouſneſs: He that is enriched by oppreſſion, or deceit, or ſets his neſt on high by flattery, or by fraud, cannot thank God for his riches, or honours; and if he doth, he blaſphemouſly makes God a partner in thoſe ſins by which he hath got his riches and honours. For though it be a truth that there is a hand of God in his gettings, (for all the craft, and policy, and oppreſſion which men uſe, will never be able to make them either rich or great, if God did not permit and order it ſo) yet the heart of God is not with him in it, and God will not own his own hand in giving them wealth or power, further then as they are a teſtimony againſt them, of his goodneſs, and their ingratitude. We may alſo ſay of ſome poor men, they have made themſelves poor, not God; He made <hi>Job</hi> poor, <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away,</hi> was his humble acknowledgement (<hi>chap.</hi> 1.21.) but there are ſome, of whom we cannot ſo much ſay God hath made them poor by his ſad providences to them, as that they have made themſelves poor by their idleneſs and improvidence, or by their prodigality and vain profuſeneſs; yet even of ſuch poor men we may truly ſay,
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:104248:328"/> there be a righteous hand of God upon them in leaving or giving them up to the luſts of their own heart, their lazineſs, or laviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which produce their utter undoing, and bring them to a morſel of bread. So that let men be in what condition they will, the Lord is the former of it. The diligent hand maketh rich, but it is with the bleſſing of God; and when an indiligent man becomes poor, it is the curſe of God upon him for his ſin, as well as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of his ſin. Yea, when an honeſt diligent man becomes poor, (that's the caſe of ſome) it is the Lords with-holding of his bleſſing, which makes all his labours fruitleſs and ſucceſsleſs; ſuch a man is indeed one of God's poor, or a poor man of God's making; and God will ſurely make the poverty of ſuch a man (if he continue in a believing dependence upon him, and in an humble ſubmiſſion to him, if he know how to want as well as to abound, how to be hungry as well as to be full, and in every eſtate hath learned therewith to be content, as the holy Apoſtle had, then (I ſay) God will ſurely make the poverty of ſuch a man bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him then riches, or the largeſt portion of this worlds enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The poor of God's ſpecial making, are under his ſpecial keeping and bleſſing: As they have but little, ſo they want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; God himſelf will always be not only enough, but all to them.</p>
                  <p>Take two further inferences from the whole verſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,
<q>Princes, great and rich men must not expect to fare better with God becauſe of their greatneſs or riches. <hi>For,</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He doth not regard the rich more then the poor.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<q>The meanest man needs not fear that he ſhall fare the worſe before God for his meanneſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The moſt high God will not overlook thoſe in a low eſtate, he regardeth the poor as well as the rich; and that's matter of great comfort to the poor, when diſregarded by the rich. Though the Lord doth not make all men of an equal reſpect in the world, 'tis his will that ſome men ſhould be more regarded by men then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are, yet himſelf (in the ſence opened) beareth an equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to them all; <hi>He regardeth not the rich more then the poor, for they are all the work of his hands.</hi>

               <p>IN theſe three verſes <hi>Elihu</hi> doth two things principally; Firſt, He ſets forth the judgements of God; Secondly, He gives an account of the equity of them. He ſets forth the judgements of God,</p>
               <p>Firſt, More generally, Upon People and Nations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Upon Princes and Governours; All this in the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe. And in this judgement of God upon Nations, we may take notice,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Of the nature of it, and how it is deſcribed: and that is laid down three wayes. Firſt, <hi>They ſhall die.</hi> Secondly, <hi>They ſhall be troubled.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>They ſhall paſs away.</hi> Under theſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the judgement of God upon People and Nations is expreſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We may here conſider the ſuddenneſs of all this, <hi>In a moment they ſhall die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, We may conſider the ſeaſon, (or rather as to man, the unſeaſonableneſs) of it, it ſhall be (though in a dreaming time) when they little dream of it; <hi>The people ſhall be troubled at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.</hi> Thus we have the judgement or ſad diſpenſation of God deſcribed in this 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, both as to the acts of it, and likewiſe as to the manner of it upon the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elihu</hi> having ſhewed the judgement of God upon the people in the former part of this 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, declares alſo his judgement upon the Princes in the latter end of it; <hi>The mighty ſhall be taken away without hand.</hi> Where we ſee, Firſt, How Princes are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or called, <hi>They are the mighty.</hi> Secondly, What kinde of judgement befalleth them, <hi>They are taken away.</hi> Thirdly, The manner how this is brought about, <hi>They are taken away without hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="637" facs="tcp:104248:329"/>
               <p>From the matter of the judgement of God both upon people and Princes, <hi>Elihu</hi> proceeds to give the reaſon why the Lord deals thus with both; This he doth in the two verſes following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe of their ſin; <hi>They are workers of iniquity;</hi> in the cloſe of the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe, as they are workers of iniquity, ſo God is fully acquainted with all their iniquity, <hi>&amp;c. He ſeeth all their works,</hi> and the iniquity of their works, nothing can cover it or them from his fight; and therefore, as <hi>Elihu</hi> aſſerts the omniſcience of God poſitively in the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, ſo negatively in the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>There is no darkneſs, nor ſhadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themſelves.</hi> Now ſeeing the works of thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Princes were naught, and the naughtineſs of them was evident to God, how could he but puniſh them? And how juſt and righteous is he in puniſhing of them? By all this <hi>Elihu</hi> clears his general Aſſertion, or the point he drives at all this chapter over, namely, to prove that God is righteous; againſt which po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, he tells us before, <hi>Job</hi> having ſpoken dangerouſly, he was engaged to maintain it vigorouſly; which he doth here, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that eminent branch of it, mentioned at the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>That he accepteth not the perſons of Princes, nor regardeth the rich more then the poor.</hi> For, Princes as well as common people fall under his hand. So much for the parts and reſolution of theſe three verſes, as alſo for the general ſcope of them.</p>
               <p>Yet before I go on to the particular explication of them, I would only minde the Reader of another Tranſlation of the whole 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, which varieth ſomwhat from ours, rendring it as a deſcription of the judgement of God upon Princes, by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the people; whereas according to our Tranſlation, it is a deſcription of the judgement of God both upon people and Princes. The Tranſlation I mean, is that of the Vulgar Latine, which runs in this form.</p>

                  <p>This Reading, and the expoſitions given upon it, prove, That God is ſo far from accepting the perſons of Princes, that he does not only tell them their own, and reprove them to their face for
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:104248:330"/> their wickedneſs and Apoſtacy (as was ſhewed from the former reading of the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe) but deprives them alſo of their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and pulls them from their power; And he doth it in ſuch a manner, that every man may underſtand and ſee the hand of God in it, becauſe they ſee no hands in it. The leſs of man appears in any work of providence, whether it be in a way of mercy or of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the more of God is to be acknowledged in it: and where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of man appeareth, all, or the whole muſt be attributed unto God. The judgement which <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks of here, ſeems (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Interpretation) to have much of man in it; yet becauſe the men ſuppoſed to be in it, are looked upon as ſuch as can do lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in it, or ought to do nothing in it, therefore 'tis ſaid to be done <hi>without hands.</hi> Hiſtories have given many examples, and dreadful inſtances of ſuch calamities falling upon Princes by the riſing of the people; and then they are ſaid to be <hi>taken away</hi>
                     <q>Without hand,</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, Without any foreſeen appearance of ſuch a miſchief; a hand which was not thought of being lifted up againſt them. It is ſaid of wicked <hi>Zimri,</hi> who ſlew his maſter, that when he ſaw the people conſpire againſt him, and the City taken, <hi>he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Palace of the King's houſe, and</hi> (in the heat of his rage) <hi>ſet it on fire, and burnt the Kings houſe over him, and died,</hi> (1 Kin. 16.18.) <hi>Juſtine</hi> reports the like concluſion (upon a like occaſion) of <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> that effeminate and voluptuous Monarch of the Aſſyrian Empire. They who proſecute this Tranſlation, conceive <hi>Elihu</hi> reflecting upon <hi>Job</hi> in all this, who was very uncivilly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own people, from whom he had deſerved higheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, as he complained at the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter, they raiſed up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him the wayes of their deſtruction; they uſed him very rudely, even deſpightfully; and he was in a pining conſuming condition, as a man taken away without hand. But I ſhall not inſiſt upon this reading, but take the words according to the ſcope before given, as a deſcription of a mixt judgement from God; a judgement partly upon the people, and partly upon Princes, a judgement upon the many, and a judgement upon the mighty; <hi>In a moment ſhall they die.</hi>

                  <p>The Text is, <hi>a moment they die;</hi> Not, that they ſhall die but a
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:104248:330"/> moment, or be only for a moment dead, but they ſhall die before a moment is over; there is an Elipſis of the prepoſition <hi>[Beth,]</hi> in the Hebrew, which we ſupply in our Tranſlation, <hi>In a moment they ſhall die:</hi> A moment is the leaſt particle or parcel of time; we cannot imagine any thing ſhorter then a moment, 'tis the very point of time, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.5.) <hi>His anger endureth for a moment,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> when he would ſhew how very ſhort (comparatively) the anger of God towards his people is) <hi>but in his favour is life:</hi> Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> (Prov. 2.19.) <hi>He that ſpeaketh truth, his tongue ſhall be eſtabliſhed; but a lying tongue is for a moment:</hi> A lye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not laſt long; he that ſpeaks truth, what he ſpeaks to day, is good to morrow, and to morrow, and will be good for ever; but a lying tongue is for a moment; that is, his lies will be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and uſually they are quickly diſcovered; though he live long to tell lies, or doth nothing but tell lies as long as he liveth, yet his lyes are not long lived. <hi>Job</hi> deſcribing the joy of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite (<hi>chap.</hi> 20.5.) ſaith, <hi>It is but for a moment;</hi> like a fire of thorns, a blaze and gone: when the Apoſtle would ſtrengthen and encourage the hearts of believers againſt all the troubles and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of this preſent life, he calls them, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.) Firſt, <hi>light,</hi> Secondly, <hi>ſhort; Our light afflictions that are but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> And that we might know how quick the devil was at his work with Chriſt, the Scripture ſaith (<hi>Luke</hi> 4.5.) <hi>He ſhewed him all the Kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</hi> As to ſhew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneouſneſs of our change from death to life in the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is ſaid, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52.) <hi>In a moment, in the twinckling of an eye, at the last Trump, we ſhall be changed:</hi> So to ſhew the extream ſuddenneſs of theſe mens change from life to death, it is ſaid here, <hi>In a moment</hi>
                     <q>They ſhall die.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They? Who? Both great and ſmall, one and another of them ſhall die, or be ſwept away by death in a moment. There is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold death;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Natural; When either ſickneſs or old age diſſolves the earthly houſe of this tabernacle. The natural death of ſome is very lingring and ſlow, others are ſuddenly ſnatcht away, they die in a moment.</p>
                  <pb n="640" facs="tcp:104248:331"/>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a violent death; thus many are taken away by the ſword Martial, or Civil, others caſually: The Text is true both of natural and violent death, either of them may overtake us in a moment, yet I conceive the latter is here chiefly intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>In a moment ſhall they die;</hi> that is, ſome ſudden deſtruction ſhall come upon them, they ſhall be ſurprized by an unlooked for diſaſter, and removed out of the world, while they had not a thought of their removal.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Death of any ſort, may befal all ſorts of men.</q>
                  <p>None can plead exemption or priviledge from the grave. It is appointed to men once to die; moſt die a natural death, and any man may die a violent death; who knows how he ſhall go out of this world? Chriſt told <hi>Peter,</hi> (John 21.18.) <hi>When thou ſhalt be old, thou ſhalt ſtretch forth thy hands, and another ſhall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldst not. This ſpake he, ſignifying by what death he ſhould glorifie God.</hi> And what kinde of death was that? The Church Hiſtory aſſureth us, 'twas a violent death. He (as his maſter Jeſus Chriſt) was nailed to a Croſs, and dyed. <hi>We come but one way into the world, but there are a thouſand wayes of going out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note Secondly.</p>
                  <q>Death comes ſuddenly upon many men, and may upon all men.</q>
                  <p>The whole life of the longeſt liver in this world, is but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, compared to eternity; and there is not any moment of our life, but (with reſpect to ſecond cauſes) we are ſubject to death in it: We alwayes in ſome ſenſe (though at ſome times more) carry our lives in our hand, and how ſoon, or by what hand they may be ſnatcht out of ours, we know not.</p>
                  <p>Now if our whole life be but a moment, and we ſubject to death every moment, how ſhould we ſtand prepared for death every moment? And how ſad is it to think, that they who may die the next moment, ſhould for dayes, and weeks, and moneths, and years, never prepare for death? Moſt are loth to think of the end of their lives, till they are nearer the end of them; yet no man knoweth how near he is to the end of his life. Many put off the thoughts of death till it cometh, yet none can put off the coming
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:104248:331"/> of death; they would remove the meditation of death to the fall of their leaf, to the winter, and worſt of their old age, yet they are not able to remove death one moment from the Spring and beſt of their youth.</p>
                  <p>Note, Thirdly.</p>
                  <q>Violent death, by the ſore and ſevere judgement of God, often ſweeps multitudes away in a moment.</q>
                  <p>God can thruſt whole throngs of men, yea whole Nations into their graves together; it is ſaid (<hi>Numb.</hi> 16.21.) of <hi>Corah</hi> and his companions, <hi>The earth did cover, or ſwallow them up in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> And the Lord commanded <hi>Moſes, to ſay unto the children of Iſrael</hi> (Exod. 33.5.) <hi>ye are a ſtiff-necked people; I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and conſume thee:</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>I will take no long time for it, I can quickly diſpatch you; how many ſoever there are of you, I will do it in a moment.</hi> We have a like deſcription of the ſudden and quick diſpatch of men at the Lord's word of Command, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.19.) <hi>How are they brought into deſolation, as in a moment, they are utterly conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with terrors?</hi> The final ruine of Babylon was thus propheſied (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.9.) <hi>Theſe two things ſhall come to thee in a moment, in one day, the loſs of children and widdowhood, they ſhall come upon thee in their perfection;</hi> Thou ſhalt utterly be deſtroyed, and periſh at once for ever. The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> (Lam. 4.6.) bewayled the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, whoſe calamity was greater then that of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> which God deſtroyed in a moment: <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> were great Cities, yet how ſoon conſumed! In ſome ſenſe, there is a greater evil in a lingring deſtruction, then in a ſpeedy one; ſo the Prophet aggravates death by famine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond death by fire; becauſe to die by famine is a lingring death. <hi>Caeſar</hi> being warned that ſome lay in wait to deſtroy him ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſlighted it, and ſaid, unexpected death is moſt deſireable. And that's the lot of many great men; to which ſome conceive the Pſalmiſt had reſpect, when he ſaid, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.7.) <hi>Ye ſhall die li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e men, and fall like one of the Princes;</hi> that is, ſuddenly. But though in ſome ſence a ſpeedy death is more eligible then a lingring one, yet in many reſpects, to die ſuddenly, or in a moment, may be concluded a far greater judgement, then to ſee death coming by degrees, and deſtruction walking towards us ſtep by ſtep. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
                     <pb n="642" facs="tcp:104248:332"/> (Prov. 1.27.) ſpeaks of <hi>ſwift deſtruction, of deſtruction coming like a whirlwind;</hi> ſwift deſtruction overtakes them who are ſlow pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to receive and obey inſtruction. Thus the Lord can deal both with perſons and with Nations; he needs not make any delays, nor take time to do it, their deſtruction ſhall come (if he will ſend it) in a day, in an hour, yea, <hi>in a moment ſhall they die,</hi>
                     <q>And the people ſhall be troubled at midnight.</q>

And as there is a laxation of the members of the body, a disjoynting of the bones, ſo there is a disjoynting of the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the minde; In times of great trouble, not only is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Politick, which conſiſts of many men, but the minde of every body, or of every ſingle man is much out of joynt. The word is applyed to thoſe great concuſſions of the world (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.17.) <hi>The earth ſhook and trembled, the foundations alſo of the hills were moved, and were ſhaken at the preſence of the Lord, becauſe he was wroth;</hi> which we may interpret of the Princes and Powers of the earth, who are as hills and mountains; if the Lord do but touch them in anger, they move, yea tremble. The word is applyed alſo to the waves of the Sea, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 5.22.) which <hi>roar, and toſs themſelves:</hi> we commonly ſay, as in the Text, <hi>the Sea is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi> or <hi>'tis a troubled Sea,</hi> a toſſing Sea. That expreſſion is alſo common among us, when we ſee a man much diſquieted, <hi>he is</hi> (we ſay) <hi>in a great toſs;</hi> even as a ſhip at Sea upon the proud waves. Thus ſaith <hi>Elihu,</hi> the people ſhall be in a toſs, they ſhall feel a ſtorm in their mindes, ſudden guſts of fear and ſorrow ſhall carry them they know not whither; or they ſhall be lifted up to heaven in vain confidences, and then fall down to hell in deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts, as the tempeſt at Sea is deſcribed in the 107<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Pſalm. There is yet another rendring of the Text, in alluſion to Drunkards, who are overcome with wine, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 25.16.) <hi>And they ſhall drink, and be moved, and be mad;</hi> the word which we tranſlate <hi>move,</hi> is that in the Text; now we know drunkenneſs moves men, and puts
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:104248:332"/> all into diſorder and diſquietment: Thus the people (through the fierce anger of God, and the wine of aſtoniſhment which he gives them to drink) ſhall be moved, they ſhall reel to and fro, and ſtagger like a drunken man. Great troubles and afflictions are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Scripture the wine of aſtoniſhment, becauſe they make many ſay and do they ſcarce know what; great troubles bereave men not only of their comforts, but of their reaſon; they do not only ſtraiten them, but aſtoniſh them. They who have drowned their wits in cups of worldly pleaſure, may ſoon have them drowned in full and overflowing cups of worldly ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this Expoſition of the peoples being troubled with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, fear, and doubt, with anxiety, and uncertainty of ſpirit what to do, I ſay, beſides this, there is another way of being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, upon which ſome Expoſitors ſpecially inſiſt. <hi>The people ſhall be troubled;</hi> that is, ſhall be in a tumult; they ſhall riſe up ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiouſly, and (as, we ſay) <hi>make a commotion,</hi> they ſhall gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as many waters, with a roaring noiſe. Many people, are compared to many Waters; and there is ſomtimes a confluence, a great confluence or flood of them tumbling together: The Poet tells us elegantly what rude work a people make when they riſe up like a flood of troubled waters.<note place="margin">Ac veluti mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no in populo cum ſaepe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orta eſt Seditio, ſaevit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que animis ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobile vulgus, Jamque faces &amp; ſaxa volant furor arma mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrat. <hi>Virg. Aeneid. 1.</hi>

                     <hi>Their rage</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>findes out weapons, one throws ſtones, another throws firebrands, till all's in a ſad combuſtion:</hi> Theſe waters, if let alone, may quickly put all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a flame. The Pſalmiſt aſcribes the quieting of the Sea, and the quieting of the people to God in one verſe; yea, I conceive the one is but the explication of the other, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.7.) <hi>Which ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the noiſe of the Seas, the noiſe of their waves, and the tumult of their people.</hi> Thus ſaith <hi>Elihu,</hi> the people ſhall be in a tumult, (this ſuits with that expoſition firſt given) ready to deſtroy whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they meet next, or thoſe eſpecially who never did nor meant them any other hurt but to keep the peace, or bridle their headſtrong fury.</p>
                  <p>Yet, I rather adhere to the former Interpretation, <hi>The people ſhall be troubled,</hi> that is, they ſhall be in a great conſternation of ſpirit, neither being able (which they ſeldome are) to adviſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what to do, nor fit to receive (which they ſeldome will) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from others. And (as <hi>Elihu</hi> adds) they ſhall be thus troubled
<q>At midnight.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or, <hi>In the half of the night,</hi> as the words may be rendred;
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:104248:333"/> that's a great aggravation of the judgement. The night is a time of reſt, and midnight is the time of deepeſt reſt; ſo that for the people to be in a tumult, or troubled <hi>at midnight,</hi> is to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with matter of fear, when fear ſeemed furtheſt off, or when they ſuſpected nothing to make them afraid. <hi>David</hi> ſaith of ſome, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.5.) <hi>There were they in great fear, where no fear was.</hi> To fear at midnight, is to fear when uſually no fear is, that is, when people are at reſt in their beds: And ſo to ſay, <hi>the people ſhall be troubled at midnight,</hi> ſignifieth either, Firſt, the coming of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon a ſecure people,<note place="margin">Cum maximè ſecuri.</note> upon a people who thought themſelves, and while they thought themſelves not only out of the noiſe, but reach of danger: Or ſecondly, It may ſignifie the coming of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon a people altogether unfit to help themſelves; when a man is aſleep, he cannot give counſel how to prevent danger, and while he is in his bed, he is in no poſture to oppoſe it. All this may well be included in what <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>The people ſhall be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at midnight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note. Firſt,
<q>There are National troubles as well as perſonal.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God can ſcare not only a family, or this and that particular man, but a whole people at once; he cannot only make a childe, or a woman, but a multitude, yea an Army of mighty men tremble like a childe, and faint as the weakeſt woman. A people are many, yet every man ſhall be as if he were alone, or but one in the midſt of innumerable dangers, and of a thouſand deaths. <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Song foreſaw the dread of Nations upon the report of the Lord's miraculous conduct of Iſrael through the red Sea, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 15.14, 15, 16.) <hi>The people ſhall hear, and be afraid; ſorrow ſhall take hold on the inhabitants of Paleſtina, all the inhabitants of Canaan ſhal melt away.</hi> And when Chriſt ſpeaks of thoſe dreadful Prognoſticks of his coming, he not only ſaith, <hi>There ſhall be ſignes in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the Stars, but upon the Earth diſtreſs of Nations, with perplexity,</hi> (Luke 21.25.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Both perſonal and publick troubles are at the command of God, as both publick and perſonal peace are.</q>
                  <p>A people as well as a perſon, may and ſhall be troubled, even
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:104248:333"/> at the midnight of their greateſt ſecurity, if God give the word. <hi>I make peace</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 45.7.) <hi>and create evill;</hi> that is, the evill of trouble. There will be occaſion afterward to ſpeak further of this poynt from thoſe words (<hi>v.</hi> 29.) <hi>When he giveth quietneſs, who can give trouble, and when he hideth his face, who can behold him? Whether it be done againſt a nation, or againſt a man only; trouble of all ſorts is at the command of God;</hi> if he ſaith to ſuch or ſuch a miſchiefe, <hi>goe</hi> to a nation, it will goe; if he bid the ſword trouble them, if he bid peſtilence trouble them, if he bid famine trouble them, if he bid their owne diviſions trouble them, <hi>the people ſhall be troubled;</hi> yea, <hi>they ſhall be troubled at midnight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence note, Thirdly.</p>
                  <q>Trouble takes or ſeazeth upon many when they leaſt expect it.</q>
                  <p>God can ſend trouble when no man thinkes of it. At midnight every one is in bed, all are for reſt and quiet. The Lord uſually executes his judgements upon the unwary world, upon a ſecure people (<hi>Exod:</hi> 12.29.) <hi>At midnight the Lord ſmote all the ſirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne in the land of Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And Pharoah roſe up in the night, he and all his ſervants, and all the Egyptians, and there was a great cry in Egypt.</hi> We read alſo (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.35.) <hi>In that night the Angel of the Lord went out and ſmote in the campe of the Aſſyrians, an hundred four-ſcore and ſive thouſand.</hi> It was not a day-battel, but a night-battel; When they were all gone into their tents, and were at reſt, when the Army was ſecure; In that night did the Lord fight them by an Angel, and made a mighty ſlaughter among them. <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> king of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> was ſlaine in the night (<hi>Dan:</hi> 5.30.) even in that night <hi>wherein he made a feaſt to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of his Lords, and dranke wine before the thouſand</hi> (v. 1.) In that night not only of his ſecurity, but of his jollity and ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when he had even drowned himſelfe and his great Lords with wine and belly-cheare, in that very night the City was broken up, and <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> ſlaine; Hiſtory tells us what dreadfull work was made upon the <hi>Babylonians</hi> that night. The great Judgement day is ſo deſcribed; Jeſus Chriſt will, at laſt, trouble the world at midnight; <hi>The Day of the Lord ſo cometh</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ:</hi> 5.2.) <hi>as a thiefe in the night; when they ſhall ſay peace and ſafety, then ſudden deſtruction cometh upon them,</hi> &amp;c, Chriſt
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:104248:334"/> himſelfe ſhadowing his coming under the parable of the ten Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, who all ſlumbred and ſlept, tells us (<hi>Math:</hi> 25.6) <hi>At mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night there was a cry made, Behold the Bridegroome conteth, goe ye out to meete him.</hi> Though ſome were in a better condition then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſome wiſe, ſome fooliſh, yet all ſlept, and it was a kind of midnight to them all. Chriſt will come, and the people ſhall be troubled at midnight, and then there will be a dreadfull Cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſecure drowſie world. Therefore the Counſell of Chriſt is moſt proper (<hi>Math:</hi> 13.35.) <hi>Watch, becauſe ye know not at what houre your Maſter may come, whether at even, or at midnight, or at Cock-trowing, or in the morning.</hi> It is hard to be put to it at midnight, 'tis ſad to be in a ſleepy or ſlumbring condition when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill comes. The Goſpel ſheweth us, how much that man was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, when his neighbour came to borrow bread of him at midnight (<hi>Luke</hi> 11.5.7.) <hi>Trouble me not, my children are with me in bed, I cannot riſe and give thee.</hi> If it be matter of trouble to be called out of our bed to doe a courteſie for a friend at midnight, O what will it be to be called up to Judgement, or to be ſurprized with any Judgement at midnight! Therefore prepare and be ready for all changes. <hi>At midnight the people ſhall be troubled,</hi>
                     <q>And paſſe away.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words are a third part of the deſcription of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon a people; <hi>they ſhall die, they ſhall be troubled, they ſhall paſſe away;</hi> that is, ſome of them ſhall die, all ſhall be troubled, others <hi>ſhall paſſe away.</hi> There is a three-fold notion of <hi>paſſing away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some expound it thus, They ſhall be carried captive out of their own Country; This with the former two make up a perfect Judgement upon any people; Some ſhall die, or be ſlaine, all ſhall be troubled and vext, they ſhall be at their wits end, and the reſt ſhall be carried away captive.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>They ſhall paſs away;</hi> that is, they ſhall paſs into their graves; the forme of ſpeech here uſed may well beare that ſenſe, for death is a paſſing away, a paſſing out of this world (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 37.36.<note place="margin">Tranſire intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, non pro mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grare aliò, ſed pro abire in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchrum. <hi>Merc:</hi>
                     </note>) <hi>Loe he paſſed away and was gone,</hi> that is, he died; And that which is as death to the heavens and the earth (their great change when ever it ſhall be) is called <hi>a paſſing away</hi> (Math: 5.18.) <hi>Till heaven and earth paſſe away, one jot or one tittle ſhall in
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:104248:334"/> no wiſe paſſe away from the Law till all be fullfilled;</hi> that is, the Law ſhall ſtand in force as long as the world ſtands. Thus to paſſe away is to die. But I conceive, we are to expound this third branch of the Judgement diſtinctly from the former two, and therefore for as much as we have death in the firſt words, it will not be proper to take in death here againe, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound <hi>paſſing away</hi> by dying. The third notion, of, <hi>they ſhall paſſe away,</hi> is, they ſhall run or flee for it, they know not whether, they ſhall flee for their lives from the danger impending over them. As ſome ſhall die, and all be troubled, ſo not a few ſhall endeavour to ſave their lives by flight. Chriſt in the Goſpel foretold the great troubles and afflictions which ſhould come upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in them there was a ſad concurrence or meeting of theſe three Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the text. For when after forty yeares the <hi>Romans</hi> inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ruin'd their City, many dyed &amp; were deſtroyed by ſword and famine, all the people were troubled; Oh in what a hurry were they to ſee the <hi>Romane Eagle</hi> diſplayed before their Gates! and then they <hi>paſſed away;</hi> that is, as many as could, withdrew and got out of the danger. It is reported in hiſtory, that before the Seidge of that City, a voyce was heard in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaying, <hi>(Migremus hinc) let us paſſe from hence,</hi> they who believed that warning, departed ſoone after; And as ſome paſſed away before the Judgement came, ſo when it was come, many were ſtriving to be gone, or to paſſe away. Therefore Chriſt admoniſhed them (<hi>Math:</hi> 24.20.) <hi>Pray that your flight be not in the winter, nor on the Sabath day.</hi> I conceive, we are to underſtand this text di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly of ſuch a paſſing away. <hi>In a moment ſhall they die, and the people ſhall be troubled at midnight, and paſſe away;</hi> they ſhall doe what they can to ſecure themſelves by out-running the danger.</p>
                  <p>Note from it, Firſt.</p>
                  <q>God hath variety of meanes to humble a ſinfull people.</q>
                  <p>Into how many wayes doe the Judgements of God divide themſelves; ſeverall perſons beare ſeverall parts; here is death to many, trouble to all, flight to ſome. That, in the Prophet, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers it fully (<hi>Jer:</hi> 15.1.) where the Lord proteſting that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (no not the interceſſion of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi>) ſhould take him off from his reſolve againſt that people, ſaith, <hi>Such as are for death to death, and ſuch as are for the ſword to the ſword, and ſuch as are for the famine to the famine, and ſuch as are for the captivity
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:104248:335"/> to the captivity.</hi> There's peſtilence, and ſword, and famine and captivity ready at the call of God to take away a provoking people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>To paſſe away, or to be put to our flight, is a grievous Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
                  <p>To flee from the face of the purſuer, to run for our lives, who knows the trouble and terror of it, but they that have been in it? what a mercy is it that our dwellings are continued to us? that we abide in our places, that we neither die in a moment, are not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd by midnight-feares, but reſt quietly in our beds, though feares at midnight have been ready to ſurprize us. What a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is it, that we are not paſſing away, running, fleeing into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, as the poore Churches of God have done in ſeverall ages?</p>
                  <p>So much of Judgement upon the people in that three-fold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. We have here alſo Judgement upon Princes.</p>
                  <q>And the mighty ſhall be taken away without hand.</q>
                  <p>Not only <hi>the many,</hi> but <hi>the mighty</hi> ſhall feele the Judgements of God; For as 'tis ſayd in the former verſe, <hi>He accepteth not the perſons of Princes, nor regardeth the rich more then the poore;</hi> The mighty and the meaneſt of men are alike to God, when they are alike in ſinning againſt God: If they doe evill alike, they ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer evill alike; God accepteth no mans perſon.</p>
                  <q>The mighty ſhall be taken away.</q>

The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs did <hi>eat Angells food</hi> (Pſal: 78.5.) the food of the <hi>Abirims,</hi> of the <hi>mighty or ſtrong ones:</hi> And as it is applyed to Angells who exceed the ſtrongeſt men in ſtrength, ſo it is applyed to any ſort of ſtrong beaſts, to the horſe (<hi>Jer:</hi> 47.3.) to Bulls, (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 34.7. <hi>Jer:</hi> 50.11. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 22.13. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 68.31.) Thus the word riſeth above man to Angells, and falls below man to the beaſts of the earth;
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:104248:335"/> here 'tis applyable only to ſtrong and mighty men, of whom yet there are three ſorts.</p>

                  <p>The firſt of theſe is a natural mighty man, he hath a mighty arme, a ſtrong body, or he excells in bodily ſtrength.

                  <p>Secondly, To doe a thing <hi>without hand,</hi> is to doe it with the ſmalleſt appearance of ſecond cauſes or inſtruments. We are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſay, there muſt be a great deale of tugging to get the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty downe, who like Oakes are ſtrongly rooted and highly growne, who looke like mountaines, which cannot be removed, yet (ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi>) the Lord can take them away <hi>without hand;</hi> that is, <hi>eaſily,</hi> without any trouble at all, little meanes or very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable meanes being uſed to effect it. So then to doe a thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hand, is to doe it as if we put no hand no ſtreſſe to it when we doe it. As they who move ſwiftly or lightly are ſayd to goe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſetting a foot on the ground (<hi>Dan:</hi> 8.5.) the <hi>He-Goate</hi> came and touched not the ground, he did rather fly then goe. So to doe a thing, as if we did not put a hand to it, is to doe it with the greateſt eaſe imaginable.</p>

                     </note>Thirdly, To doe a thing without hand, is to doe it without any viſible meanes at all, even by the immediate ſtroake or power of God. There is a hand of God in all things that are done in the world, but ſome things are done without any other hand, and are therefore moſt properly ſayd to be done without hand. Thus the Lord is able to doe the greateſt things, even to take mighty men from the earth, no hand of man appearing or joyning with him in the action.<note place="margin">Nutu tantum dei. <hi>Merc:</hi>
                     </note> Now, becauſe God uſually ſets inſtruments a worke to effect his will in the world, and to bring about his counſels, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in what work ſoever he either quite leaves or ſeemes to leave inſtruments out, that work is ſayd to be done without hand. The
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:104248:336"/> 
                     <hi>ſtone</hi> which ſhall grow up to be a great mountaine, that is, the kingdome of Chriſt, is called <hi>a ſtone cut out without hands</hi> (Dan: 2.34.) that is, without humane power. The kingdome of Chriſt ſhall be ſet up ſo much by the power of God without any earthly contribution, that it ſhall confeſſedly be ſayd to be ſet up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands. Though we ought not to neglect the coming and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the kingdome of Chriſt in the world, yet we ſhould not be anxiouſly carefull about it, when we ſee little or no meanes for it, yea though we ſee great very great meanes ſet againſt it, becauſe <hi>a ſtone cut out without hands</hi> ſhall doe it.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle uſeth this forme of ſpeaking, both as to eternalls and ſpiritualls. Concerning the former he is expreſſe (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1.) <hi>We know that when the earthly houſe of this tabernacle is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, we have a building of God, a houſe not made with hands, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in the heavens;</hi> that is, a houſe of Gods own immediate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, a houſe to the making whereof man hath added nothing. The fabrick of this viſible world is a houſe made without hands, much more is heaven, and the glorious unſeene ſtate which Saints ſhall have hereafter. The houſe above, or ſtate of Glory is wholly of Gods making. And as our eternall eſtate is expreſſed by a houſe made without hands, ſo our ſpirituall eſtate is called by the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>A work done without hands</hi> (Col: 2.11.) where having aſſerted our compleatneſs in Chriſt (<hi>v.</hi> 10.) he adds, <hi>In whom alſo ye are circumciſed with the circumciſion made without hands.</hi> The external literal circumciſion was made with hands; there was an operation of man in it, the cutting off the foreskin of the fleſh, but in the ſpiritual circumciſion, man hath no hand, it is the work of God alone; as alſo that effectual faith is which alwayes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth it, and is therefore called (<hi>v.</hi> 12.) <hi>the faith of the operation of God.</hi> There is a temporary faith which we may call a faith of the operation of man, but true ſaving faith is the operation of God, and may be ſayd as the ſpirituall circumciſion (which was ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſhadowed by the corporall) to be <hi>made without hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as the Scripture ſpeakes both of ſpiritualls and eternalls which are made without hands,<note place="margin">Indicatur divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſupplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, cujus nulla humana cauſa aſſignari, aut quod nulla hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana vi decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari poteſt.</note> ſo this text ſpeakes of externalls and providentialls in the ſame language, <hi>The mighty ſhall be taken away without hand,</hi> that is, without any creature-helpe or viſible humane hand; what ever is done without a viſible hand, is done by the hand of God. <hi>Elihu</hi> intimates a puniſhment upon the
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:104248:337"/> mighty, which (as to the effecting of it) cannot be aſſigned to any thing in man, much leſſe can the effecting of it, be hindred by man. The hand of God is moſt viſible, in doing that which no viſible hand hath done, or can undoe. <hi>They ſhall be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>The mightieſt have no might againſt God.</q>
                  <p>That cannot be avoyded by any humane power, which is done without humane power. God ſlew the firſt-borne of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and deſtroyed the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> hoaſt without hand, he did it by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, no hand appearing againſt them. The Lord ſmote <hi>Herod,</hi> and he died without hand (<hi>Acts</hi> 12.23.) <hi>Immediately</hi> (that is, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, as the Greeke word imports, 'tis true alſo, immediately, that is, without humane meanes, as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> word alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports) <hi>the Angel of the Lord ſmote him, and he was eaten of wormes, and gave up the Ghoſt.</hi> What a poore worme was that mighty man in the hand of God, when God ſlew him without hand, and commanded the wormes to eate him? Jeſus Chriſt, who is alſo the <hi>mighty God</hi> (Iſa: 9.6.) called himſelfe <hi>a worme and no man,</hi> in his humiliations for the redemption of loſt man (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 22.6.) What are the mightieſt men but wormes to God, who is ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that if he ſay the word, wormes become their Maſters. The mighty Giants are before God but pigmy's, punyes, or children. The Prophet gives a good warning (<hi>Jer:</hi> 9.23.) <hi>Let not the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty man glory in his might.</hi> Let him not glory in the might of his arme, Let him not glory in the might of his armes or Armies, though man have an Army of mighty men about him, yet let him not glory in them, no nor in the might of his power or authority. If any man uſeth his might againſt God, what is his might unto God? (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 58.1.) <hi>Why boaſteſt thou O mighty man, that thou canſt doe miſchiefe?</hi> If a man be mighty, and have a mind to doe miſchiefe with his might, eſpecially if he boaſteth in his might, becauſe he can doe miſchiefe with it, he is not only ſinfull, but weake and fooliſh. There is no greater morall weakneſs then to boaſt either of naturall, martiall, or civill ſtrength. Could any of the mighty men of this world ſtand before the might of God, they had ſomewhat to boaſt of. Read the word of the Lord againſt the mighty (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 2.10.) Behold the Kings and Captaines of the
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:104248:337"/> earth trembling before the preſence of the Lambe (<hi>Rev:</hi> 6.15.) and then judge how weake the ſtrongeſt are before the Lord? All ages are full of teaching examples, that there is no might to his who is Almighty.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>What ever God will doe he can eaſily doe it.</q>
                  <p>He can effect it with a looke, with a caſt of his eye, he can doe it with a breath of his mouth, he can doe it with a word. It is ſaid (<hi>Exod:</hi> 14.24.) <hi>God looked unto the hoſt of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and through the cloud, and troubled the hoſt of the Egyptians, and tooke off their Chariot wheeles, that they drave them heavily.</hi> To looke upon them was an eaſie thing, God did not give them a ſtroake with his hand, but only a looke with his eye, and that overthrew them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>God can do the greatest things alone.</q>
                  <p>He can ſubdue the mighty, though none come forth to his help againſt the mighty; they are curſed who do not help the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the mighty, when they ſet their might againſt the Lord; (<hi>Judg.</hi> 5.23.) <hi>Curſe ye Mero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> (ſaith the angel of the Lord,) <hi>curſe ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof, becauſe they came not forth to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty.</hi> But though it be the ſin of man not to help the Lord againſt the mighty, yet the withdrawing of their help doth not hinder the Lord in his purpoſe againſt the mighty: For, <hi>He taketh away the mighty without hands.</hi> Though men ſtir not, though angels ſhould not ſtir to his help, yet his own arm can bring either ſalvation or deſtruction. It is ſaid of the Lord (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.24.) <hi>He ſtretched out the heavens alone;</hi> there was none to help him to unfold that vaſt canopy of heaven, he ſtretcht out the heavens alone. As in the Creation <hi>he made all alone,</hi> ſo in Providence he can act and effect all alone. <hi>It is a great glory to God, that he hath many inſtruments to help him, many tongues to ſpeak for him, many hands to work for him; but it is a greater glory to God that he needs none to help him, none to ſpeak or work for him.</hi> In this the glory of the Lord infinitely outſhines the glory of all the mighty Kings and Princes of the earth. They have done, and can do mighty things, but not
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:104248:338"/> without hands, and therefore they have the hands of thouſands at command for them; 'tis not their place to put their hand to the work, 'tis enough that they give commands and orders, 'tis the duty of others to execute all their righteous commands, and fulfil their orders. But the Lord hath not only a commanding power, but an executing power too in himſelf; though no hand move, yet his affairs ſtand not ſtill. God, and all creatures put together, are no more then God alone without any creature: Many are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but none are neceſſary unto God. Take two inferences from it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This is matter of terror to wicked men; though they ſee no hand in the world againſt them, much leſs any able to match them, leaſt of all to check them, yea though they ſee all hands for them, yet this is no ſecurity to them, this is no aſſurance of one hours ſafety, ſeeing the Lord taketh away the mighty without hand, and he uſually doth it when they ſee not which way any hand can reach them. It is the concluſion of one of the Ancients upon this place in reference to a mighty oppreſſour; <hi>He is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly pull'd down,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Inviſibilitèr rapitur, qui vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibiliter rapie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, <hi>Gregor.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>who did viſibly pull down; He ruined others with hands, but himſelf ſhall be ruin'd without hand; he ſaw him whom he took away, but he ſhall not ſee him who takes him away.</hi> Let them who live without fear of any hand, remember the Apoſtles admonition, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.31.) <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hand of the living God, who takes away the mighty without hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, This is matter of wonderful comfort, to all that fear God, and truſt upon him, whether Princes or people, whether mighty men or mean men. What though ye ſee no hand for you; yet 'tis enough if he be for you who ſaves you without hand. The protecting and ſaving power of God, is as great and as effectual as his deſtroying power is; yea, he oftner ſaves without hand, then he deſtroyes without hand. As the Kings of the earth, ſo the great King of heaven and earth, loves to deal his favours, and beſtow his rewards immediately with his own hand, but uſually afflicts and puniſheth by the hands of others. That's a moſt preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Scripture to this purpoſe, (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.7.) where the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth <hi>to ſave Judah;</hi> But Judah might ſay, I am in a very low condition, and no help appears: Therefore he addeth, <hi>I will ſave them by the Lord their God; and will not ſave them by Bowe, nor by Sword, nor by Battel, nor by Horſes, nor Horſemen.</hi> Judah ſhall
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:104248:338"/> be ſaved, though there be no hand to ſave them. <hi>I will ſave them</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>by the Lord their God.</hi> I will do it immediately. And the Lord doth not only ſay (in the affirmative) he will ſave them without hand; but he ſaith alſo (in the Negative) that he will not ſave them with hands, <hi>But I will not ſave them by Bowe, nor Sword, nor Battel, nor Horſes, nor Horſemen;</hi> there ſhall be no appearance of theſe helps, I have heretofore deſtroyed you by Sword, and Bowe, by Horſes, and Horſemen, but I will have all the honour and thanks of your ſalvation to my ſelf. Though the Lords people have neither horſes nor horſemen, though they are as helples as is imaginable, yet the Lord is able to ſave them, &amp; he wil do it in the fitteſt ſeaſon. As this is true in reference to Princes and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their publique capacity, ſo private Chriſtians may take up the comfort of it. What though great diſtreſs and affliction be nigh, and no hand to ſave you, yet the Lord can ſave without hand; if you are low, he can raiſe you, though none lend a hand to raiſe you; if poor, he can enrich you; if weak, he can ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en you, though you have no means for either: It is an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpring of comfort, that the Lord can do all things without hand, that he needs not be beholding to the creature, nor ſtands in need of their help to effect either threatned judgments againſt Babylon, or his promiſed mercies unto Sion.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have ſeen <hi>Elihu</hi> deſcribing the righteous, though ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere dealings of God, both with people and Princes, who deſpiſe his counſels, and provoke his wrath: The reaſon why they fall under his wrath, is further diſcovered in the next words.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>God is a Spirit, the ſimplicity of his Eſſence is his firſt and higheſt perfection, he is purely incorporeal; yet as the paſſions of man's minde, ſo the members of his body are often in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture attributed unto God; we read of the <hi>face of God,</hi> of the <hi>hand of God,</hi> of the <hi>ear of God,</hi> and as in many other places, ſo in this, of the <hi>eyes of God:</hi> Now as the ear of God notes only his power of hearing, and the hand of God his power of working, ſo the eye or eyes of God note only his power of ſeeing, knowing and diſcerning the wayes of men. And when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>his eyes are upon the wayes of man,</hi> his meaning is only this, he clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerns and underſtands the wayes of man.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words, <hi>his eyes are upon the wayes of man,</hi> intimate,
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:104248:339"/> Firſt, A preſent act, he doth not ſay, they were, or they will be upon the wayes of man, but <hi>they are.</hi> Secondly, They imply as a preſent, ſo a continued act; his eyes are ſo upon the wayes of man, that they are never off them. The eyes of God dwell, as it were, upon the wayes of man: His eyes are ſaid indeed <hi>to run to and fro through the whole earth,</hi> (2 Chron. 16.8.) yet they do not wander from one object to another, but are fixed and ſetled upon every one. Thirdly, they imply an intentive act, or the ſeri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the heart of God upon the wayes of man. We may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a thing, and yet take no great notice of it; but when our eyes are ſaid to be upon any thing, this imports they are buſied much upon it. Fourthly, This manner of ſpeaking ſignifieth not only a clear ſight, but that which is operative, carrying with it a moſt exact ſcrutiny or diſquiſition of the wayes of men, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that expreſſion of the Pſalmiſt, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.4.) <hi>His eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, his eye-lids try the children of men.</hi> God doth not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, but his eye-lids try the wayes of men; that is, he ſo looks upon them, that he looks through them, and diſcerneth what they are to the utmoſt. God doth not only behold the body and bulk of our actions, but the ſoul and ſpirit of them, and while he ſeeth them, he ſeeth into them. All this, and much more then we can apprehend, is comprehended in thoſe words, <hi>His eyes are upon</hi>
                     <q>The wayes of man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word is plural, not <hi>way,</hi> but <hi>wayes;</hi> which ſhews the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſiveneſs of the ſight or knowledge of God: The word being put indefinitely, is to be taken univerſally: His eyes are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to this or that object, to this or that place, to this or that perſon, but his eyes look over all, <hi>His eyes are upon the wayes of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet further, <hi>the wayes of man</hi> may be diſtinguiſhed; Firſt, As they are either internal or external. The internal wayes of man, are the wayes of his heart, as the Prophet hath it, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17.) <hi>He went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</hi> And theſe wayes of the heart, our inward wayes are, firſt, our thoughts, what we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine and conceive; ſecondly, our affections, what we love, and what we hate, what we rejoyce in, and what we mourn for, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the way of our hearts. Thirdly, The wayes of the heart are a man's purpoſes, reſolutions, and intentions what to do. Fourthly,
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:104248:340"/> The wayes of the heart are man's deſignes, or his aims, what he drives at, or propoſeth as his end in all that he doth. In this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude we are to underſtand the preſent Text; when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>the eyes of God are upon the wayes of man,</hi> remember they are upon his thoughts, upon his affections, upon his purpoſes, upon his deſignes and aimes, all theſe are before the Lord; as it is ſaid of Chriſt, (<hi>Joh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> 2.25.) <hi>He needed not that any ſhould teſtifie of man; for he knew what was in man;</hi> that is, both the ſtate of his heart, and all the movings of it. And if the Lord's eyes be upon the internal wayes of man, then certainly they are upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal wayes of man; if he knoweth what work the heart is at or about, certainly he knoweth what the hand is at or about. He that knoweth which way the minde goeth, cannot but know which way the foot goeth. His eyes are upon the external wayes of man, but 'tis his chief glory that his eyes are upon the internal wayes of man, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5.) <hi>The Lord ſaw that the wickedneſs of man was great upon the earth:</hi> He ſaw man's actions or outward wayes were very wicked, but beſides that, ſaith the Text, He ſaw, <hi>that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</hi> He ſaw the wayes within, what was formed up, or (as the word there notes) what creatures were made and faſhioned in the minde of man. Thus, if we take the wayes in that diſtinction of internal and external, the eyes of God are upon them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take the wayes of man as differenced in their kinds, as they are either good or evil; the eyes of the Lord are upon both. <hi>They are</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 15.3.) <hi>in every place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the evil and the good:</hi> that is, the evil wayes and the good wayes of men. But ſaith not the Prophet (<hi>Habbak.</hi> 1.14.) <hi>Thou art of purer eyes then to behold evil?</hi> Which may ſeem, at firſt reading, to imply, that God doth not behold the evil wayes or act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of men. I anſwer, if we diſtinguiſh the word <hi>behold,</hi> we ſhall ſoon reconcile theſe Scriptures. To <hi>behold,</hi> is either to diſcerne what is before us, or to <hi>behold,</hi> is to approve what is before us. There is a ſeeing of knowledge, and there is a ſeeing of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; now when the Prophet ſaith, <hi>the Lord is of purer eyes then to behold evil,</hi> his meaning is, he doth not, he cannot behold evil with contentment or approbation, otherwiſe the Lord beholds e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, even all the evil in the world; <hi>both good and evil are before him, who is himſelf only and altogether good.

                  <p>Now, when <hi>Elihu</hi> aſſerts, <hi>The Lord ſeeth all his goings;</hi> we may ſum up the matter under theſe five conſiderations; He ſeeth Firſt, Where he goeth, what his path is. Secondly, He ſeeth whether he is going, what he makes the end of his journey or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. Thirdly, when he goeth, or ſets out, what time he takes for every undertaking. Fourthly, how far he goeth, the Lord takes notice of everyſtep, what progreſs he makes in any buſineſs
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:104248:341"/> good or bad. Fifthly, he ſeeth in what manner he goeth, with what heart, with what mind, or frame of ſoule he goeth. Thus diſtinct and exact is the Lord in <hi>beholding the wayes, and in ſeeing all the goings of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt.</p>
                  <q>Surely the Lord is a God of knowledge.</q>
                  <p>If we could conceive a man to have his eyes in all places, and upon all perſons, an eye upon all hearts, and an eye in all hearts, as wel as an eye upon all hands, you would ſay this man muſt needs be a knowing man, eſpecially if he have ſuch an eye, as the eye of God is, a diſcerning eye, a diſtinguiſhing eye, a trying eye, an eye which ſeeth to the bottome of whatſoever it ſeeth. <hi>Hannah</hi> ſayd this in her ſong (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>Speak not ſo proudly, let not arrogancy come out of your lips; for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</hi> 'Tis not a ſlight ſuperficial knowledge which God hath of things or perſons, <hi>by him actions are weighed,</hi> and ſo are the Actors. God puts all into an even ballance, and he will weigh both perſons and actions to a graine, yea every word and thought ſhall goe into the ballance. It was ſaid to that great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch <hi>Belteſhazer,</hi> by a hand-writing upon the wall, <hi>Thou art weighed in the ballances.</hi> The Lord weighed that great King, he weighed all his power, and the exerciſe of it; and he that weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Kings, will not leave the meaneſt ſubject unweighed; <hi>by him actions are weighed.</hi> We many times paſſe over our actions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſideration, and never take the weight of them, at leaſt, we never weigh them in the Sanctuary ballance. If they will beare weight in the ballance of the world, we preſume they will in Gods ballance alſo. But as the Lord is a God of knowledge otherwiſe then man is, ſo by him actions are weighed otherwiſe then by man. It is ſaid of Idolls (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 115.15.) <hi>They have eyes and ſee not;</hi> but we may ſay of the Lord Jehovah the true God, the living God, he hath properly, no eyes, yet he ſeeth; and his faculty of ſeeing is infinitely above that which himſelfe hath planted in man. The Atheiſt while he is about the worſt work in the world, the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in pieces of the people of God, and afflicting his heritage, while he is ſlaying the widow, and the ſtranger, and murdering the fatherleſſe, while he is (I ſay) at ſuch kind of worke as this, he ſaith (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 94.7.) <hi>The Lord ſhall not ſee; neither ſhall the God
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:104248:341"/> of Jacob regard it.</hi> But what ſaith the Pſalmiſt to him and ſuch as he (<hi>v.</hi> 8, 9.) <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand ye brutiſh among the people, he that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the eye, ſhall not he ſee?</hi> Thoſe words of the Prophet to King <hi>Aſa</hi> (2 Chron: 16.9.) <hi>The eyes of the Lord run too and fro through the whole earth,</hi> are an alluſion to a man who having a deſire to know much, or to ſee all in the world, runs up and down, travels from place to place, from Country to Country for infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The Lord would have us know that he knoweth every thing as exactly, as they who run from place to place to ſee what's done in every place. It is prophecyed of the latter times (<hi>Dan:</hi> 12.4.) <hi>Many ſhall run too and fro, and knowledge ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed;</hi> that is, many ſhall be ſo graciouſly greedy of knowledge, that they will refuſe no labour nor travel to attaine it. <hi>They will run too and fro,</hi> to inquire and ſearch for it, they will not thinke any time or labour loſt, if they may but gaine that precious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity by it, called true knowledge, or the knowledge of the truth. And that expreſſion of <hi>running too and fro,</hi> may wel be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, they ſhall by diſcourſe and arguing beare out the truth; In diſcourſing the mind runs too and fro faſter then the feete can in travelling; In diſcourſe we run from poynt to poynt, from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reaſon, from objection to objection, from queſtion to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, till we come to ſolid anſwers and concluſions, and ſo know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is increaſed. The Lord is ſurely a God of knowledge, whoſe <hi>eyes run too and fro</hi> without motion, and ſee the bottome of all things, without diſcourſe or argumentation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>The Lords knowledge of man never abateth, he is alwayes obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and alike obſerving what men doe and what men are.</q>
                  <p>The beſt the moſt waking men, have their ſlumbrings and ſleepings; but the Lord neither ſlumbreth nor ſleepeth, <hi>his eyes are upon the wayes of man.</hi> And when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The Lord doth neither ſlumber nor ſleepe,</hi> we may underſtand it in a twofold reference. Firſt, as to the protection of his people (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 121.4.) <hi>Behold he that keepeth Iſrael, ſhall neither ſlumber nor ſleep;</hi> that is, he watcheth over them ſo unceſſantly, ſo unweariedly, that no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger can approach them without his knowledge. Secondly, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſlumbereth nor ſleepeth as to the obſervation and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all people, he never takes his eye off from the wayes of man.</p>
                  <pb n="662" facs="tcp:104248:342"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note
<q>The Lords knowledge or ſight of mans wayes, is univerſall and everlaſting.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The All-ſeeing God ſeeth all our wayes, and he ſeeth them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes. And he ſeeth them all alwayes by one act. The Lords view or proſpect of things is not ſucceſſive one after another, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive, all at once. The Lord hath a large eye, and an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eye, yea is all eye. He knows all things; Firſt, paſt or that have been; Secondly, preſent or that are; Thirdly, future, poſſible or that ſhall be. Thus ſaith the Lord in the Prophet (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 46.10.) <hi>I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done.</hi> And upon this read the Lords challenge of all the Idolls in the world (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 41.21, 22, 23.) <hi>Let them ſhew the former things what they be, that we may conſider them and know the latter end of them, or declare us things to come; Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods.</hi> As if the Lord had ſayd, if ye can tell us all that's paſt, or any thing that is to come, as I can, then ye may take the honour of God, otherwiſe ye are but lyes and vanities. Againe the Lord knows all things; Firſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtraction; and ſecondly, he knows all things with cleareſt diſtinction; it is no more trouble to the Lord to ſee all things then to ſee one, and he ſeeth all things as if he had but one thing to ſee.</p>
                  <p>From the conſideration of this knowledge of God, let me give foure or five inferences for inſtruction.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt, (which is moſt naturall to the text) if,</hi> the Lords eyes be upon the wayes of man, if he ſeeth all his goings, then all the Lords Judgements are right.</q>
                  <p>The Judges of this world, may have a principle of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in them, and we may call them juſt and righteous Judges, yet all their Judgements are not alwayes right. For, as ſome men are ſo ignorant, that they know nothing at all, ſo there are none ſo knowing as to know all things; the cleareſt ſighted Judges doe not ſee all that may concerne them in giving Judgement; even among them ſome may be blinde, and many blinded, ſome are blinde and cannot ſee much, others are blinded and will not ſee
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:104248:342"/> all that they ſee, they are blinded poſſibly with bribes and gifts, with hopes or feares, with paſſions and prejudices. And how cleare-ſighted and honeſt-hearted ſoever any are, yet they cannot ſee all, ſomewhat may lye out of their ſight. Hence it cometh to paſſe, that a juſt Judge may doe that which is unjuſt, he cannot ſee quite through every matter, though he ſet himſelfe to ſearch the matter before he giveth Judgement. But as the Lord is all righteouſneſſe in his principle, and beares an everlaſting love to righteouſneſſe; ſo he hath a cleare ſight of all things and perſons, and therefore he muſt needs give a righteous Judgement concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things, actions, and perſons; Though he overthrow nations he is righteous, though he overthrow Princes he is righteous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſeeth into all things, and proceedeth upon certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of every mans caſe and condition. He cannot erre in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who hath no error in his Judgement, nor any deviation in his will.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Secondly, If</hi> the Lords eyes are upon all the wayes of men, <hi>then,</hi> certainly ſinners, whoſe wayes are evill, ſhall never goe unpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</q>
                  <p>For if he have a principle of righteouſneſſe in him, and an eye to ſee all their unrighteous wayes, they cannot eſcape his juſtice; Say to the wicked, <hi>woe to him, for he ſhall eate the fruit of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> (Iſa: 3.11.) The righteous God knoweth the unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man, and therefore woe to the unrighteous man.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Take this concluſion, Then</hi> no godly man, no good man ſhall goe unrewarded, or looſe the reward of that good which he hath done.</q>
                  <p>The Lord is righteous, and he ſeeth every one that doth right, or the righteouſneſſe of every mans way; and it is his promiſe to reward the righteous, therefore they ſhall be rewarded. This is matter of ſtrong conſolation, and great encouragement to all that are righteous; If the Lord ſeeth all they doe, nothing which they have well done ſhall be loſt in the dark, or lie in the duſt. <hi>God will bring forth their righteouſneſſe as the light, and their juſt dealing as the noone day:</hi> And as the knowledge which God hath of their wayes, aſſureth the righteous that they ſhall be rewarded for, ſo that they ſhall be aſſiſted and protected in their doing
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:104248:343"/> righteouſneſſe. The Prophet makes that inference in the place before-cited (2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 16.9.) <hi>The eyes of the Lord run too and fro through the earth</hi> (what followeth?) <hi>to ſhew himſelfe ſtrong in the behalfe of them,</hi> or (as we put in the Margin) <hi>ſtrongly to hold with them whoſe heart is perfect towards him.</hi> The Lord is alwayes ſtrong, and alike in ſtrength, his hand is not ſhortned at any time, that he cannot ſave, yet he doth not alwayes ſhew his ſtrength; but as he is ſtrong, ſo he will ſhew himſelfe ſtrong for the perfect or upright in heart; that is, he will act his ſtrength to the utmoſt for the ſafety and aſſiſtance of thoſe whoſe hearts are perfect with him. So then, as they that are good, and doe good, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for the good they have done, ſo they ſhall be protected in the dangers and evills they incurre while they are doing good. Another Prophet ſpeakes both theſe inferences from this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the knowledge or ſight of God (<hi>Jer:</hi> 32.19.) <hi>He is great in councell, and he is mighty in working, for his eyes are upon all the wayes of the ſons of men, to give to every one according to his wayes, and according to the fruit of his doings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Fourthly, If the eyes of the Lord are upon all the wayes of the Children of men, <hi>then the Lord will call all men to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for their wayes.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Why doth he take notice of their wayes, but to bring them to a reckoning? That's the Apoſtles concluſion (<hi>Rom:</hi> 14.12.) <hi>So then every one of us ſhall give an account of himſelfe to God;</hi> God would not take an account of our wayes while we live, if he did not intend to bring us to an account when we dye. As the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of God fits him to call every man to an account, ſo it is an evidence that he will. Why ſhould our wayes and workes be ſtrictly obſerved and recorded, if they were not to be judged?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, This truth that the eyes of God are upon all the wayes of man, ſhould awaken every man to take heed (as <hi>David</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved he would, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 39.1.) to his wayes. Did we walke as <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring we are under his All-ſeeing eye,</hi> O how circumſpectly ſhould we walke! doth the Lord inſpect our wayes, O how ſhould we inſpect our owne wayes! It argueth a great deale of Atheiſme in the heart, if not the groſſeſt Atheiſme, yet Atheiſme <hi>(quo-ad hoc)</hi> as to this or that thing: while that which ſome are afraid to doe, if a man, yea if a child ſee them, they are not afraid to doe
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:104248:343"/> though they heare that God ſeeth them. To feare to doe a thing when the eye of a creature is upon us, and yet to doe it notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God ſeeth us, what is this but either an unbeliefe that the eye of God ſeeth us, or a contempt of his All ſeeing eye? This Divine Attribute, the All-ſeeing eye of God, wel wrought upon the heart by faith, is enough to over-aw the ſinfullneſſe of our hearts. And though the people of God have a higher princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, upon which they forbeare the doing of evill, then this, becauſe God will ſee it, and puniſh it, yet to keep the heart in a holy feare of doing evill upon that principle, is both needfull and our duty. The Apoſtle would not have ſervants doe their Maſters commands <hi>with eye-ſervice as men-pleaſers.</hi> It is indeed a baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a ſervant to doe his duty meerely becauſe his Maſters eye is upon him, or to forbeare to doe what is againſt or beſide his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe his Maſter ſeeth him; but how great is the impudence and wickedneſs of that ſervant who will not keep to his duty, when his Maſters eye is upon him! So, in this caſe, meerely to forbeare doing evill, becauſe we heare God ſees us, is eye-ſervice, but how great is their wickedneſs, who will not forbeare to doe evill, though they heare and know that God ſeeth it? Which <hi>Elihu</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes yet further in the next words.</p>

<pb n="666" facs="tcp:104248:344"/> (<hi>Jer:</hi> 16.17.) where he firſt aſſerts that God ſeeth all, <hi>mine eyes are upon all their wayes,</hi> and then denyeth, that any thing is a ſecret unto him, <hi>They are not hid from my face, neither is their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity hid from mine eyes.</hi> Theſe latter words of the Prophet are of the ſame ſignification with theſe of <hi>Elihu,</hi>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may take darkneſs two wayes; Firſt, for naturall dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that darkneſs which ſpreads it ſelfe over the face of the earth upon the going downe of the Sun, 'tis the privation of Light. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, there is artificiall darkneſs, that darkneſs which men make to hide themſelves, and their actions in, from the eye of God or man; many are very skillfull, yea and ſucceſſefull in making ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes to hide their actions from men: They cover the evill which they have done with ſuch cunning excuſes or flat denyalls, and they cover what they purpoſe to doe (how foule ſoever) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch faire trappings of words, and ſpecious pretenſes, they gloſſe their worſt actions and intentions with ſuch appearances of good, that the wiſeſt and beſt ſighted men cannot finde them out. When <hi>Abſalon</hi> had a moſt unnaturall as well as a moſt diſloyall purpoſe to rayſe a tebellion againſt his <hi>king-father,</hi> he coloured it with a devout profeſſion of performing a vow; This was artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all darkneſs. 'Tis reported by the naturall Hiſtorian, of a little fiſh, which ſeeing its enemy neare, caſts out a kinde of blackneſs from it ſelfe, which darkens the water, and ſo eſcapes the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Thus men indeed hide themſelves from man, and they would hide themſelves from God too; but <hi>there is no darkneſs,</hi> neither naturall nor artificiall, that can cover their wayes from his eye; No,
<q>Nor ſhaddow of death.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The importance of this expreſſion hath been opened more then once in this book, (<hi>chap.</hi> 3.5. <hi>chap:</hi> 10.21. <hi>chap.</hi> 12.22. <hi>chap.</hi> 28.3.) therefore I ſhall not ſtay upon it here; only conſider, when he ſaith, <hi>There is no darkneſs nor ſhaddow of death,</hi> by <hi>ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death,</hi> he means extreameſt darkneſs. If there be any dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks <hi>chap.</hi> 10.22.) like darkneſs it ſelf, and whoſe light is as darkneſs, that is it. The metaphor is taken from the grave, where the dead being buried, have not the leaſt glympſe, ray, or
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:104248:344"/> ſhine of light coming in to them, death wraps us up in extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt darkneſs. And we finde in Scripture, <hi>the ſhaddow of death</hi> put firſt, to expreſs the extreameſt of ſpiritual darkneſs, or the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſpiritual ſtate, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.2.) <hi>The people that walked in darkneſs, have ſeen a great light, they that dwell in the land of the ſhaddow of death, upon them hath the light ſhined:</hi> that is, they that were wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up in the ignorance &amp; utter unbelief of God in Chriſt, to theſe is Chriſt, the true light of God, the Sun of righteouſneſs preached and openly revealed, and they preſſed to the receiving of him, that their ſouls may live further as the ſhaddow of death is put for the worſt of ſpiritual evils, or to note man's natural ſtate before converſion, ſo likewiſe, it is uſed in Scripture to note the worſt of his ſpiritual evils, who (being converted) is in a ſpiritual ſtate; He that is in a ſpiritual ſtate, may be under great ſpiritual evils, great ſoul afflictions and troubles may fall upon him; which I conceive <hi>David</hi> intended while he ſhewed ſuch high confidence, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4.) <hi>Though I walk through the valley of the ſhaddow of death, I will fear none evil:</hi> as if he had ſaid, Though I were in the worſt of ſoul-afflictions, having no light of the favour of God ſhining upon me, nor any comfort in my ſpirit, though (as <hi>Heman</hi> bemoans his deſerted condition (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.3.) <hi>My ſoul is full of troubles, and my life draweth nigh unto the grave, though I am laid in the lowest pit, in darkneſs, in the deep, yet I will fear no evil, for thou art with me, thy rod and thy ſtaffe they comfort me.</hi> Again, the ſhaddow of death is often put in Scripture for the worſt of outward worldly evils, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 13.16.) <hi>Give glory to the Lord your God before he cauſe darkneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and while ye look for light, he turn it into the ſhaddow of death;</hi> that is, while ye expect good times and things, ye fall into the worſt, or the worſt befal you. Now as theſe words, <hi>the ſhaddow of death,</hi> ſignifie the worſt of, both in ſpirituals and temporals; ſo here they ſignifie the cloſeſt concealment of moral evils; ſome ſinners think themſelves, as much out of ſight as a buried carcaſs, and they vail their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with ſuch darkneſs as is like the very ſhaddow of death. Sin is it ſelf a ſhaddow of death, yea death it ſelf, and they who are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, will do their beſt that their ſins may be no more ſeen then the dead are. But <hi>there is no darkneſs nor ſhaddow of death</hi>

                        <pb n="668" facs="tcp:104248:345"/>Where the workers of iniquity may hide themſelves.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What it is to be <hi>a worker of iniquity,</hi> was opened at the 8th verſe of this chapter, and thither I refer the reader. Only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral know, <hi>Workers of iniquity</hi> are more then ordinary ſinners, they are cunning at the committing, and cunning at the hiding of ſin. Some are but bunglers at ſin, they cannot ſin with ſuch an helliſh skill as others do, and when they have ſinned, they have not the art of hiding it; but others are (as we ſay) their crafts-maſters both wayes, and they are properly called <hi>workers of iniquity.</hi> Yet (ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi>) the very <hi>workers of iniquity,</hi> they that make it their profeſſion, their ſtudy, and their buſineſs to do evil, and to hide the evil they have done, to work miſchief in the dark, and to keep their works in the dark, even they cannot be hid in any darkneſs. And when the Text ſaith, there is no darkneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein the workers of iniquity may hide themſelves; the meaning of it is, they ſtand naked, and in the open light before the eyes of God.</p>
                  <p>For though <hi>Elihu</hi> doth not ſay from what they cannot <hi>hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> yet we may take it two wayes; they cannot hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, firſt, from the ſight of God; he will diſcern them. The Prophet ſaith of God (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.15.) <hi>Thou art a God that hidest thy ſelf,</hi> (it is the word of the Text in another conſtruction) that is, as I conceive, it may be expounded, <hi>Thou art an inviſible God.</hi> God hides himſelf naturally, or in his own nature, for that is inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: likewiſe God ſomtimes hideth himſelf voluntarily, as ſomtimes he manifeſteth or ſheweth himſelf voluntarily; but he is a God alwayes hid as to his nature, becauſe he is inviſible; and ſo he is called <hi>a God that hideth himſelf,</hi> in oppoſition to Idols or falſe gods, who are obvious to the eyes of men; Idols have eyes and ſee not, but themſelves are ſeen by every eye. Jehovah the true God ſeeth, but hath no eye, neither can any eye ſee him; Thus he is a God hiding himſelf in the ſpirituality of his own being, which groſs Idols cannot: the following words in that Text in the Prophet ſeem to make out this ſence, (<hi>verſ.</hi> 16.) <hi>They ſhall be aſhamed and confounded all of them,</hi> (that is, all Idol-makers, and Idol-worſhippers, ſhall be aſhamed and confounded) <hi>they ſhall go to confuſion together, that are makers of Idols.</hi> Now, as God hideth himſelf both theſe wayes, ſomtimes voluntarily, or in his will, he reſolves to hide himſelf from his people, as <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd,
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:104248:345"/> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 13.1.) <hi>How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?</hi>) alwayes in the ſpirituality of his own nature; ſo ſinful men would be hidden too: though they cannot be hidden as to their nature, that being corporeal, yet they would hide themſelves in their will, their wits are bent upon it, to make covers and ſhaddows for themſelves, that they may keep out of the ſight of God, or that they may not be ſeen of him, who cannot be ſeen, but is, in that ſence, <hi>a God that hideth himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as men cannot hide themſelves from the ſight of God, ſo not, ſecondly, from the revenging power of God: This followeth the former; for he that would keep out of the ſight of another, doth it uſually that he may be hid from that danger and evil which he fears that other might bring upon him. Thus it is with the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he hath his hiding places, he would withdraw himſelf from the revenging power of God, like a malefactor, who is unwilling to appear and come to the Bar before his Judge, but all in vain.</p>
                  <p>Meer natural or unregenerate men are much hidden from themſelves; that is, they ſee little what themſelves are, they know not their own condition, nor upon what terms they ſtand; even a godly man is much hidden from himſelf, <hi>his life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> (Col. 3.3.) his life is not only hidden from the world, but in a great meaſure from himſelf: the excellency of his ſpiritual ſtate ſurpaſſeth his preſent ſight: but a wicked man is much more hid from himſelf, he doth not ſee the wickedneſs of his own heart, nor the danger, the deſperate danger he is in, he ſeeth not that he is within a ſtep of the pit, or that there is, as it were, but a wainſcot between him and hell fire; he ſeeth none of theſe things. Thus a wicked man is hidden from himſelf, and 'tis his work to prepare darkneſs and ſhaddows of death to cover his dead works from God. But there is <hi>no darkneſs</hi> will ſerve his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, nor <hi>ſhaddow of death wherein he may hide himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It is uſual for, and natural to ſinners, to ſeek hiding places.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is no darkneſs,</hi> &amp;c. he plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, that it is the deſigne and buſineſs of ſinners, to make dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to hide themſelves; it is as much their buſineſs to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when they have done evil, as it is their buſineſs to do evil.
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:104248:346"/> while the workers of iniquity confeſs in general the eyes of God behold their ways (they deny not in word that God is All-ſeeing) yet, as they often blear the eye of man, ſo they are not out of hope to put darkneſs and raiſe a miſt between themſelves and the eye of God; Or if they riſe not to this vain thought, that they can hide themſelves from God, yet they come to this, that God hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himſelf (as not regarding what they do) from them. Hence <hi>David</hi> affirms of the wicked man, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.11.) <hi>He hath ſaid in his heart, God hath forgotten, he hideth his face, he will never ſee it.</hi> Many ſay in their hearts, God ſeeth them not, while with their tongues they confeſs he is an all-ſeeing God. The heart hath a tongue in it as well as the head, and theſe two tongues ſeldome ſpeak the ſame language: While the head-tongue ſaith, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hide our ſelves from the ſight of God, the heart-tongue of wicked men will ſay, God will hide himſelf from us, he will not ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if their heart ſpeak not thus, then as the Prophet ſaith, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.15.) <hi>They dig deep to hide their counſels from God;</hi> ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they have a hope to hide their counſels, elſe they would not dig deep to hide them. Their digging is not proper, but tropical; as men dig deep to hide what they would not have ſeen in the earth; ſo they by heir wits, plots, and devices, do their beſt to hide their counſels from God, and <hi>they ſay who ſeeth, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth?</hi> We, ſurely, are not ſeen either by God or man.</p>
                  <p>Now 'tis very natural for ſinners to endeavour the hiding of themſelves from God upon a two-fold account; Firſt, To avoid ſhame; All ſinners are not altogether deboiſt, all have not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether baffled their own conſciences, they have a kinde of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, they would not be ſeen ſinning; it troubles them not to do evil, but a fear to be detected in doing it is their trouble. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Sinners hide themſelves for fear; ſo <hi>Adam</hi> did, he wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Prophet tells us of ſuch (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.21.) <hi>They ſhall go into the clefts of the rock, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his Majeſty, when he ſhall ariſe to ſhake terribly the earth.</hi> We finde all ſorts call to <hi>the hills to hide them, for fear of him that ſate on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,</hi> (Rev. 6.15, 16.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>How much ſoever ſinners attempt, yet they cannot hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from God.</q>
                  <pb n="671" facs="tcp:104248:346"/>
                  <p>Let them ſtudy never ſo long, and dig never ſo deep, they cannot be hid: Where can a ſinner be hid from him who is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where? Or, what thing can be our covering from him, in whoſe ſight all things are open? Then let none think they have made a good market in ſinning, when they have hid their ſins from the eyes of men; what will it avail to hide your ſelves from men, when you lie open and manifeſt to the eye of God? read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.12. <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. The Apoſtle ſaith (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.24, 25.) <hi>ſome mens ſins are open before hand, going before to judgment;</hi> (that is, other men quickly ſee what they are, &amp; can judge what they have done) <hi>and ſome men, they follow after;</hi> though they were hidden at the firſt, yet they are afterward diſcovered unto men often, as alwayes unto God: As they are not hid from God now, ſo he will bring them forth at laſt, in the ſight of men: that the Apoſtle adds in the next verſe, <hi>Likewiſe alſo the good works of ſome are manifeſt before hand, and they that are otherwiſe cannot be hid.</hi> The word <hi>otherwiſe</hi> may have a two-fold reference; Firſt to the word manifeſt: As if he had ſaid, though the good works of a man be not preſently manifeſt, yet they cannot be long hid, they ſhall be opened and revealed. Secondly, The word <hi>otherwiſe</hi> may refer to good works, and ſo it reaches the point fully; that is, thoſe works which are not good, or otherwiſe then good, cannot be hid, though men labour much to hide them. Sinners, leave off your hiding, leave off your hiding, for you ſhall not be hid. There is no way for ſinners to hide themſelves from God; they may hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in God, in the love, in the favour and mercy of God. Thus ſinners may hide themſelves in God, but from God they cannot be hid. Chriſt is a hiding place unto his people, and he is ſo in a double reſpect; Firſt, from trouble, or in time of trouble; thus <hi>David</hi> ſpake (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.7.) <hi>Thou art my hiding place: The name of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 18.10.) <hi>the righteous runneth into it</hi> (for ſhelter in time of trouble) <hi>and is ſafe.</hi> The Prophet is expreſs in this, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.2.) <hi>A man</hi> (that is Chriſt) <hi>ſhall be for a hiding place from the winde, &amp; a covert from the Tempest:</hi> Chriſt is truly ſo, as to the outward troubles and ſtorms which men raiſe againſt his people in the things of this life; he is ſo, eſpecially as to thoſe internal troubles and ſtorms which Satan, or our owne unbelieving hearts raiſe againſt us about the things and concernments of the next life. <hi>That man who is
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:104248:347"/> alſo God, who is God-man, is the hiding place of humbled ſinners,</hi> againſt the aſſault of all evils, whether temporal or ſpiritual. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, As Chriſt is a hiding place from thoſe troubles which men bring us unto for righteouſneſs ſake, or which Satan and our own hearts bring us into by raiſing queſtions about our intereſt in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; So he is a hiding place for us againſt our own unrighteouſneſs. Sinners or unrighteous perſons cannot hide themſelves from Chriſt. And as Chriſt is the beſt hiding place from bodily dangers, ſo he is the only hiding place from ſoul-danger: Any ſinner may hide himſelf in Chriſt, as to the guilt of ſin, whoſe eyes are opened to ſee and acknowledge his ſin. Or more diſtinctly, ſinners under a fourfold conſideration may hide themſelves in Chriſt; Firſt, if humbled ſinners. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if confeſſing ſinners. Thirdly, if reforming ſinners. Fourthly, believing ſinners Chriſt is a hiding place to all ſuch ſinners.<note place="margin">Cum videri nos non credimus, in ſole clauſos oculos tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. Illum à nos abſcondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, non nos illi. <hi>Greg. l 25. c. 6.</hi>
                     </note> And ſeeing no ſinner can hide himſelf from the wrath of God by any means of his own deviſing or contriving: Let all ſinners give over ſuch vain contrivements, and learn that Goſpel wiſdome, to hide themſelves in Chriſt from that wrath which is to come. When we labour to hide our ſelves any other way, we loſe our labour, and do not hide our ſelves from God, but God from our ſelves; that is, we hide the favour and mercy of God from our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Men are not eaſily perſwaded that they cannot hide themſelves from the ſight of God.</q>
                  <p>That hath much hold of us, which we are often warned to avoid. This is not the only place of the whole Scripture, no nor of this particular book where this truth is held forth. There are many and many Scriptures wherein this common truth is preſſed upon us. And doth not this (if not ſtrongly infer, yet) intimate at leaſt that man doth not eaſily believe it? Yea, Is it not an argument that man is apt to nouriſh himſelf in thoſe vain hopes, that he can hide himſelf from God, or that he ſhall be hid from God? I may caſt the fooliſh preſumptions of men about this thing into four ſorts. Firſt, Some hope to be hid in the croud, or that they ſhall not be taken notice of among ſo many. Secondly, The eyes of others are ſo darkned, that their ſins are hid from themſelves, yea
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:104248:347"/> they take their vices for vertues, their evil acts for good; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee no evil in what they do, they are perſwaded, or preſume God doth not. Thirdly, Many are never ſo well pleaſed as when they are flattered, or when others not only hide the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of their wayes from them, but commend and extol them as vertuous and praiſe worthy. And becauſe their evil ways appear good to ſome men, they cannot be convinced that there is any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in them appearing to God. Laſtly, As all impenitent ſinners put their ſins out of their own ſight, ſo nothing pleaſeth them more then this imagination, that they ſhall never come into the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p>Surely the Lord would never urge this matter ſo often upon the children of men if it were not ſo. But let ſinners conſider what they will do, and what will become of them, ſeeing, as it is impoſſible that they ſhould be hid, ſo it will be moſt intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them them to appear and ſtand before God in the day of judgement, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.5.) All muſt come to judgment, and appear at the Bar, but it will be an inexpreſſible grief to appear, and not be approved, or to appear and then be condemned. Therefore be wiſe, and hide your ſelves where you may be hid; do not attempt to hide your ſelves (which is the attempt of moſt ſinners) where you cannot be hid: They who will needs hide themſelves in that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſhaddow of death, here ſpoken of, ſhall be caſt into utter darkneſs, and abide for ever in that infernal valley of the ſhaddow of death, in which there is no eaſe to be had, and from which there is no releaſe to be got. Darkneſs and death will be the portion of thoſe ſinners in the next world, who have ſtudied to ſhaddow their ſins with any kinde of darkneſs in this.</p>

                  <p>The words have a two-fold ſence.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some interpreters render them as a direct deniall of any power ſeated in or liberty given unto man, to plead, capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, or to come in judgement with God; <hi>Elihu</hi> charging it upon <hi>Job,</hi> that he had not done well in taking or uſing ſuch a liberty to complaine about his condition; addeth here (according to this interpretation) God neither hath nor will indulge man a liberty (as he hath not given him a juſt cauſe) to complain as if he had don him wrong.<note place="margin">Quia non ultra unquam ponet deus ſuper vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. <hi>i. e.</hi> pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatem homini nunquam faciet, ut de ſe ille que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri poſſir. <hi>Merc:</hi> Ne<expan>

                  <p>Secondly, The words (as we render them) carry both an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, that God is juſt, and a demonſtration of it; <hi>For he will not lay upon man more then is right, that he ſhould enter into judgement with God;</hi> that is, man hath no cauſe to enter into judgement with God, if God ſhould give him leave, and let him be at his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in that poynt; <hi>for God will not lay upon man more then is right.</hi>

                  <p>But I ſhall rather proſecute the text according to the ſupply given in our tranſlation, which makes the reaſon why all ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints ſhould be forborne and ſilenced, to be this, becauſe the ſufferings of man are never proportion'd beyond his deſert.</p>
                  <q>He will not lay upon man more then right.</q>
                  <p>That is, more then he hath deſerved, or is equitable in his caſe; whatſoever is layd, or impoſed upon man beyond right, he hath cauſe to complaine of, and may traverſe the Judgement, or deſire another hearing, yea he may appeale to ſome higher Judge if there be any; But if what is awarded againſt him be right ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:104248:349"/> to Law, and ſutable to Juſtice, let the ſentence be what it will (let him be able to beare it or no, much more if he be able alſo to beare it, as in this caſe it is) he hath no cauſe at all to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a review of it. Thus it is (ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi>) in all the dealings of God with man, <hi>He will not lay upon man more then is right,</hi>
                     <q>that he ſhould enter into judgement with God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To enter (or goe) into judgement</hi> (as the word is) is either to begin or renew a ſute, and to deſire the hearing of the cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. God makes no faulty Judgements, why then ſhould any cauſe determin'd by him come to a ſecond hearing? there may be reaſon enough among men to heare a cauſe againe, but what God reſolves, needs not be reviewed much leſſe reverſed. Here then <hi>Elihu</hi> meets with thoſe frequent complaints of <hi>Job</hi> under his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and likewiſe with thoſe his ſeverall motions, and earneſt petitions, to have his cauſe heard afreſh, as if God had preſt him too ſore, or, at leaſt, had not done him right in ſuffering him to be ſo ſorely preſt by men. Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> ſeemes to ſay; <hi>God never gave any man any juſt cauſe, to plead his cauſe over againe with him, nor hath he given thee (O Job) any cauſe to deſire it of him.</hi> 'Tis true, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men, yea and ſometimes godly men, when (as <hi>Job</hi> here) they are greatly afflicted, are ready to thinke and ſay they are over-ſeverely dealt with; But the reaſon of <hi>Elihu</hi> ſtands good and firme againſt all theſe thoughts and ſayings. <hi>For he will not lay upon man more then is right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>God never wronged, nor will wrong any man.</q>
                  <p>There are two ſpeciall caſes, in which God never did, nor ever will wrong man; Firſt, he will not wrong man by denying him that reward, which he hath freely promiſed, no man ſhall ſerve God for naught; he ſhall not ſay, God hath promiſed, but he hath not performed. The experience of his people ſeale to the truth of his promiſes, as wel as their faith imbraceth it. That hope of man which is anchored in a promiſe of God, never miſcarried not made any man aſhamed. Secondly, God will not wrong man, by laying upon him a greater puniſhment then he hath threatned. The Magiſtrate cannot be charged with laying more puniſhment upon an offender, then is right, if he puniſheth him not more then
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:104248:349"/> the Law alloweth. There may be a great deale of ſeverity (I grant) in puniſhing up to the rigor of the Law, but there is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs in it. The Moſaical law allowed of forty ſtripes; now if they had layd forty-one upon any offender, they had layd upon him more then was right, becauſe they exceeded the Law; and to have layd full forty ſtripes, which was the utmoſt they could by Law, had been ſevere, therefore they uſually abated one ſtripe at leaſt; Hence the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 11.24.) <hi>Of the Jewes five times received I forty ſtripes ſave one;</hi> if they had given <hi>Paul</hi> forty ſtripes they had done no wrong as to the Law, though one had been too many for and a wrong to him who had not broken their law. Seeing the Lord lays no more upon the worſt of ſinners, then the law alloweth, he doth not lay upon man more then right, Yea not only the chaſtiſements which the Lord layeth upon his owne ſervants, but the greateſt puniſhments which he layeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the worſt of the wicked, in this world, are much leſſe then might with Juſtice be inflicted. This was <hi>Ezra's</hi> humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement before the Lord (<hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13.) <hi>And after all that is come upon us, for our evill deeds, and for our great treſpaſſe, ſeeing that thou our God haſt puniſhed us leſſe then our iniquities deſerve.</hi> The puniſhment that was upon the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great, in ſo much that <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith in his prayer (<hi>Chap:</hi> 9.11, 12.) <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the whole heavens, hath not been done, as hath been done upon Jeruſalem,</hi> yet <hi>Ezra</hi> ſpeaking of that very diſpenſation, ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt puniſhed us leſſe, then our iniquities deſerve. In this life the greateſt of our puniſhments, are leſſe then the leaſt of our ſins.</hi> Every ſin, or tranſgreſſion of the Law, deſerves eternall death; therefore in this life the greateſt puniſhments that fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſinners, are leſſe then their ſins. As the leaſt mercies which God beſtoweth upon them, are greater then the greateſt of their deſervings. (That was <hi>Jacobs</hi> free confeſſion (<hi>Gen:</hi> 32.10.) <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of</hi> (or I am leſſe then) <hi>all the mercies, and of all the truth which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant)</hi> So the greateſt puniſhments that fall upon them in this life, are leſſe then the leaſt of their ſins: And in the next life, where ſinners ſhall have full meaſure, heaped up, preſſed downe, running over, and that for ever, yet then they ſhall not have one graine more, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of weight or meaſure, then they have deſerved. <hi>The Lord layeth upon no man in this life ſo much, nor in that to come more then is right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="678" facs="tcp:104248:350"/>
                  <p>Hence it followeth, Secondly.
<q>Man hath no cauſe to complaine of God, or God hath not given any man any cauſe to complaine whatſoever his ſufferings are.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why ſhould he complaine who hath but his right? As God hath not given any man a liberty to complaine, ſo he hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven any man juſt occaſion, or a true reaſon to complaine. If the burden of puniſhment be heavy upon any man, let him thanke his own ſin, or ſelfe for it, he hath but his due from God. We are often cruel to and wrong our ſelves, God is uſually mercifull, and never but juſt to us; yea how great ſoever any affliction is, 'tis a mercy that 'tis no greater; and God can quickly make it greater, how great ſoever it is, and ſtill be juſt. <hi>As he never doth more then he may, ſo he never doth ſo much as he can in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us.</hi> The Lord hath more in the treaſures of his wrath, then yet he hath powred upon the worſt of ſinners. Nor indeed can the moſt capacious veſſels of wrath, hold all his wrath; 'tis, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is, infinite. <hi>Cain</hi> ſayd, <hi>My puniſhment is greater then I can beare</hi> (Gen: 4.13.) yet God could have made his puniſhment greater then it was. Therefore <hi>Jeremy</hi> confeſſed (<hi>Lam:</hi> 3.22.) <hi>It is of the Lords mercies that we are not conſumed, becauſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions faile not.</hi> Whatſoever is leſſe then utter conſumption, hath ſome mixture of compaſſion in it, every puniſhment hath ſomewhat of compaſſion in it, except that of everlaſting damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. O then let all fleſh feare and tremble to enter into Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with God, to complaine or take offence at any of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with them.</p>
                  <p>There are foure things conſiderable in God, which ſhould ſtop all mens mouths, from daring to doe ſo.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He is moſt powerfull; there is no eſcaping out of his hands.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He is moſt wiſe and ſeeth quite through all that man hath done with his hand, yea all that hath been contrived in his heart.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He is moſt juſt, and will not be taken off from doing leſs, neither can he be provoked to do more then is right to any man.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, How ſhould man fear to enter into judgement with God; ſeeing his judgments are paſt finding out; they are, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:104248:350"/> ſaith, <hi>a great deep,</hi> we are not able to fathome them; therefore wo unto thoſe that complain of, or murmure againſt them: we ſhould alwayes pray with <hi>David, (Pſal.</hi> 143.2.) <hi>Lord, enter not into judgement with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living be juſtified:</hi> and we ſhould alwayes be afraid to enter into judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with God, for he will not only juſtifie, but magnifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his works in the ſight of all men living. We ſhould be ſo far from entring into judgement with God (which many do when they think they do it not) that we ſhould continually beg him, not to enter into judgement with us; for we are not only unable to ſtand before him, but muſt certainly be broken before him; as it followeth,</p>

                  <p>There is another reading of the words, Our Tranſlators put it in the margin of our Bibles, <hi>He ſhall break in pieces mighty men without ſearching out,</hi> which may have a two-fold interpretation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He ſhall break them in pieces, and no man ought to ſearch or enquire into his doings, or <hi>ſay unto him</hi> (as that mighty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch confeſſed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.35.) <hi>What doest thou?</hi> And thus it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers what was ſaid in the former verſe, <hi>They ſhall not enter into judgement with God.</hi> Some have a priviledge at Sea to paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſearching, no man muſt enquire what they carry, or what their lading is; ſurely when the Lord breaketh mighty men, no man may ſearch into his doings, or enquire into his actions, further then for his own inſtruction and admonition, that he may anſwer the purpoſe of God in them, and give him glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He will break them in pieces <hi>without ſearching;</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Deus cui omnia nota ſunt, non opus habet, in facta hominum inquirere, <hi>Druſ.</hi>
                     </note> without any formal examination or uſual wayes of Proceſs, at leaſt without any known to us. The Lord needs not to ſtand ſearching as men do, to finde out matters againſt the mighty, to frame articles, or to bring in his Bill of Attainder againſt them; God needeth not ſearch to know, becauſe he knoweth all things without ſearching, and therefore may juſtly break men in pieces without this kinde of ſearching; or, <hi>He will break them in pieces without inquiſition;</hi> that is, without ſhewing cauſe why. God doth not alwayes publiſh the reaſons of his proceedings, his judgements are often ſecret, though never unjuſt. We render well, <hi>He will break in pieces mighty men.</hi>

                  <p>That is, how many ſoever they are, or though they are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, yet he will break them in pieces as one man: Thus the word is uſed (<hi>chap.</hi> 5.9. <hi>chap.</hi> 9.11. In both which places the Reader may finde the extent and emphaſis of this expreſſion, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number,</hi> further explained) only conſider, that theſe mighty men without number, may be taken two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Collectively, as combined by leagues, or as marſhall'd by orders into an Hoſt: as if he had ſaid, though an Army of them be gathered together, even a numberles Army, yet the Lord can break them in pieces, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.9.) <hi>Aſſociate your ſelves, and ye ſhall be broken in pieces; gird your ſelves, and ye ſhall be broken in pieces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may take theſe mighty men ſingly or perſonally; Thus the Lord breaketh in pieces <hi>mighty men without number,</hi> one after another, one at this time, and another at that time; how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them ſoever ariſe up one after another to oppoſe him, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his people, or to do wickedly, they ſhall ſurely be broken. Mr <hi>Broughton</hi> renders to this ſence, <hi>He bruiſeth, mighty men without end,</hi> he doth not break them without end, as having no end in breaking them, but as without end, notes his breaking them endleſly, or for ever. If men will ſin without end, he can break them without end; he can renew deſtruction, as faſt as they renew tranſgreſſion.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve, Firſt,
<q>God can eaſily ruine the mightiest men of the world.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He can break them in pieces, as an earthen veſſel, with an iron rod, and how ſoon is that done? Both the holy Scriptures, and humane Hiſtories abound with ſuch examples. What a number of mighty men inhabited the old world? <hi>There were Giants in the earth in thoſe days,</hi> (Gen. 6.4.) yet God overthrew them all by a flood, they ſank like lead in thoſe mighty waters. What mighty men inhabited <hi>Canaan,</hi> before the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came to poſſeſs it? The ſearchers of the land brought in a report, that they were but as Graſhoppers to them, &amp; they had Cities walled up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet the Lord broke in pieces all thoſe mighty men, <hi>Sihon the King of the Amorites, and Og the King of Baſhan;</hi> and when <hi>David</hi> came to the Crown, he (in Gods ſtrength) deſtroyed the reſt of
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:104248:352"/> them. What mighty men were they that ſate upon the Throne of the four Monarchies? They had in their dayes the rule of the whole world, yet the Lord brake them in pieces. Firſt, the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian, then the Perſian; the Grecian, and the Roman Monarchs were alſo broken in pieces: This was revealed to the golden head in a dream, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 2.35.) <hi>Then was the Iron, the Clay, the Braſſe, the Silver, and the Gold broken in pieces, and became like the chaffe of the Summer threſhing floor.</hi> The mighty men of Iſrael, (when they ſinned mightily) the mighty men of the ten Tribes, yea the mighty men of the two Tribes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> God brake in pieces; his own mighty people could not ſtand before him, when they corrupted themſelves, and would not be made clean. God breaketh mighty men, as eaſily as they break his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And uſually when mighty men come to that height of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to ſin, or break his Commandments with eaſe, he commands them (for his own eaſe, as he is pleaſed to ſpeak <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.24.) to be broken in pieces. To ſin with eaſe, is a ſure ſigne of a hard heart, yea of a prophane heart. He was a mighty man of this temper, whoſe breaking in pieces the Lord threatned in ſuch wrathful Rhetorick by his holy Prophet, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.25, 26, 27.) <hi>And thou prophane wicked Prince of Iſrael, whoſe day is come, when ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſhall have an end; thus ſaith the Lord God, Remove the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, and take off the Crown: this ſhall not be the ſame, Exalt him that is low, and abaſe him that is high. I will overturn, overturn, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn, and it ſhall be no more, until he come whoſe right it is, and</hi> I <hi>will give it him.</hi> What breaking words are here! Even a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble overturn denounc'd againſt the mighty. Thus ſaid the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin while her ſoul was magnifying the Lord, and her Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit rejoycing in God her Saviour, (<hi>Luke</hi> 1.52.) <hi>He hath put down the mighty from their ſeats, and exalted them of low degree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>In that, he breaketh in pieces the mighty without nmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>'Tis no matter to God either how mighty or how many the wicked are.</q>
                  <p>I have heretofore ſpoken of the multiplyed acts of Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and of the unwearied out-goings of his powerful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to abate the pride of man, and therefore I ſhall not ſtay
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:104248:352"/> upon it, but only caution the mighty ones of the earth, in the words of the Pſalmiſt upon this point, expreſt in the very words of this Text; for, God having ſaid to his Son, to whom he had given the Nations for an inheritance, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.9.) Thou ſhalt break them with a rod of iron, and (in caſe of their non-ſubmiſſion to his Scepter) daſh them in pieces like a Potters veſſel, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently adds, (<hi>ver.</hi> 10.) <hi>Be wiſe now therefore, O ye Kings, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed ye Judges of the earth; ſerve the Lord with fear, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with trembling; Kiſs the Son, lest he be angry, and ye periſh from the way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet though God be often at breaking work, he is not alwayes at it; for when he hath broken in pieces mighty men without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he (as it followeth in the Text) will
<q>Set others in their ſtead.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may ſuppoſe theſe words given in upon a two-fold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To ſhew the abſoluteneſs of the power of God, as well in ſetting up, as in caſting down:</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To ſhew that we need not be diſmayed nor diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, when we ſee God breaking in pieces ſome or many migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men, for he can finde out others to ſupply their room,<note place="margin">Ne ex hoc cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur deperire humani generis ſtatus, addit &amp; ſtare facit alios, <hi>Aquin.</hi>
                     </note> and fill up the breaches which he hath made. <hi>He ſets others in their ſtead.</hi> The force of the Hebrew is, <hi>He ſhall make others to ſtand;</hi> and that's more then barely to ſet another in the ſtead or place of thoſe that are removed and broken. God is able not only when many fall to raiſe up others, but he can alſo eſtabliſh and ſettle thoſe whom he raiſeth up. That's the meaning of <hi>Elihu,</hi> when he ſaith
<q>And ſet others in their ſtead.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> doth not determine who or what theſe others are; God may make his choice where and of whom he pleaſeth, in what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily or tribe he pleaſeth, to ſet up in the place of thoſe mighty men, whom he, at any time, is provoked to break in pieces. The words are plain; Note only two things from them.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> God hath as abſolute a power to ſet up, as to pull down when and whom he pleaſeth.</q>
                  <pb n="684" facs="tcp:104248:353"/>
                  <p>(Pſal. 75.6, 7.) <hi>Promotion cometh neither from the East, nor from the West, Nor from the South, but God is the Judge, he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth down one, and ſetteth up another.</hi> The ſame Soveraignty of God is aſſerted (<hi>Dan.</hi> 4.17.) <hi>To the intent that the living may know, that the most high ruleth in the Kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will, and ſetteth up over it the baſest of men.</hi> God ſomtimes ſetteth up thoſe that are baſe in their conditions or manners for a ſcourge or puniſhment; ſomtimes he ſetteth up thoſe that are baſe in their ſtate or condition, being either men of meaneſt birth, or men laid loweſt by affliction, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.7, 8.) <hi>He raiſeth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghil; that he may ſet him with Princes, even with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his people.</hi> No man is ſo poor, but the Lord can enrich him; no man ſo low, but he can raiſe him up. He can bring a man from a dunghil to a Palace, and from the duſt to a Throne. <hi>Saul</hi> was caſt down, God broke him in pieces, though a mighty man, and ſet up <hi>David</hi> in his ſtead; <hi>He choſe David his ſervant, and took him from the ſheepfolds, from following the Ewes great with young, he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Iſrael his Inheritance:</hi> (Pſal. 78.70.71.) When God pull'd down <hi>Haman</hi> (the great favourite of <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi>) who had plotted to advance <hi>Mordecai</hi> to the gallows, and ruine the whole ſeed of the Jewes, God did not only break him and his plot, but really advanced <hi>Mordecai</hi> into greater favour and confidence with his Prince then ever <hi>Haman</hi> had before.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note from the force of the word, <hi>to make to ſtand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>The Lord can eſtabliſh thoſe whom he ſetteth up.</q>
                  <p>The Lord doth not only ſet up, but keep up whom he pleaſeth. Though they are weak whom he ſetteth up, yet he can keep them up; though they whom he ſetteth up, are oppoſed by the ſtrong, yet he can keep them up. He can make a ſhrub ſtand faſt, though oppoſed by a Cedar; and a reed to ſtand firm like a rock, though oppoſed by an Oak.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>The Lord taketh care of the Government of the world.</q>
                  <p>He is not for breaking work only, he is for ſetting and ſetling too. God will not let the body of a people periſh for want of a head; but when in judgement he hath broken one in pieces, he
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:104248:353"/> in mercy ſets up another. Mighty men are like pillars, which bear the weight of a whole Commonwealth or Kingdom. God rarely deals with Nations, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did with the houſe wherein the Philiſtims were aſſembled, who at once pull'd away the pillar, and pull'd down the houſe; but if he pulleth away one pillar, he puts in another, that the houſe may ſtand. God will not leave the world without rule or rulers: when he takes with one hand; he gives with another; when <hi>Judas</hi> the Traytor was broken, Chriſt found out (a better man) <hi>Matthias</hi> to ſet in his ſtead. And when the whole Nation or Church of the Jewes was broken and rejected, God called in the Gentiles, and ſet them up for a Church and people to himſelf in their ſtead; and (which is the greateſt inſtance of all) when Jeſus Chriſt was taken from the earth, when he left the world, who was the mighty one (he was firſt broken in pieces for our ſins, and afterwards taken away) yet he gave a ſupply, and left us another in his ſtead; <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſs,</hi> (ſaith he <hi>John</hi> 14.18.) <hi>I will come unto you,</hi> though not till the great day in perſon, yet every day in the gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of my Spirit. <hi>I will pray the Father and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;</hi> (John 14.16.) Again, (<hi>John</hi> 16.13.) <hi>When he the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all truth.</hi> God ſent the Spirit in Chriſt's ſtead; he doth that for us which Chriſt did for us while he abode on the earth: and therefore the holy Spirit is not unfitly call'd the Vicar of Chriſt here on earth, he feeds the flock of Chriſt, he looks to his people, he teacheth, he comforteth them in Chriſt's ſtead. And thus in Nations, when God breaketh one Governour, he ſets up an other in his ſtead; he will not leave Nations without guides and leaders, nor ſuffer the ſtaff of Government to be utterly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, which is the greateſt plague that can come upon any people. From the whole verſe take theſe tree deductions.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is a vanity and an uncertainty, at least the vanity of uncertainty in all worldly greatneſs and powers.</q>
                  <p>God blaſts and breaks them as he pleaſeth: The moſt ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial things on earth are but as a ſhaddow; or like the Land-ſea's continually flowing and ebbing. One is caſt down, and another is exalted; one is broken, and another is ſet up; yea, the ſame man who was lately exalted and ſet up, may quickly be caſt down and
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:104248:354"/> broken. There is no aſſurance to be had of the beſt things here below, but only this, that we cannot be ſure of them: and 'tis good for us, that we cannot be ſure of the beſt things here below, both becauſe we are ſo apt to ſay, <hi>It is good for us to be here,</hi> where yet our beſt things are not to be had, as alſo becauſe by this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration we may be provoked to look after, and make ſure of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things then any are here enjoyed, even thoſe beſt things which are under hope.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Great examples of God's judgements, are to be eyed and marked.</q>
                  <p>Why doth <hi>Elihu</hi> call <hi>Job</hi> to this conſideration, but that he might be humbled, and give God glory; it is not for nought that God breaks in pieces the mighty ones of the earth, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11.) <hi>All theſe things have hapned unto them for enſamples; and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</hi> As all thoſe things among the Jewes were Types; ſo all that God doth to this day upon the Princes, and Powers of the world,<note place="margin">Nunquam cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam ſuam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probi niſi in poena agnoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt. <hi>Greg. lib. 25. Moral. cap. 9.</hi>
                     </note> are but as types and enſamples; they are for admonition, that we ſhould conſider thoſe ſins which have brought ſuch judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon men, ſuch breaking judgements, and avoid them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome will never ſee ſin in it ſelf, but in the judgments of God all may ſee what ſin is; when mighty men are broken in pieces, what will God do with the reſt, if they ſin againſt him, and provoke the eyes of his glory? <hi>Zenacharib</hi> that proud Prince, who invaded the land of Iſrael in the time of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> being broken in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by his own bowels (his ſons ſlew him) it was ordered to be writ upon his Tomb,<note place="margin">In me intuens pius eſto. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod. lib. 2.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Let every one that ſeeth me, learn to fear God, and not to defie him, as I have done.</hi> The breaking of the powers of the earth, ſhould exceedingly exalt the fear of God in our hearts.<note place="margin">Quicunque celſa domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur aula me vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deat &amp; tu Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ja, nunquam do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenta dedit ſors majora, quam frogili loco ſtarent ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbi. <hi>Senec. in Troad. de Hecuba, Act: 1. Sc. 1.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>It is better to learn wiſdome by the puniſhment of others, then by our own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If God will break the mighty, though many, yea though innumerable; This is comfort to the people of God when they are oppreſt, and broken by oppreſſors, let them remember God is able to break their oppreſſors, though they riſe up like Hydra's heads one after another; read the whole fifty and ſecond Pſalm, as alſo the 39<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 40<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſes of the 107<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Pſalm, as a clear proof of this. <hi>Elihu</hi> having ſhewed what ſad breaches God makes upon mighty men, makes a fourth inference in the words following.</p>

                  <p>For as much as God breaketh them, it is an argument that he knoweth what they are, and what they have been doing; There is a threefold reading of theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some read them as implying God's making others to know their works, God maketh the ſecret ſins of men viſible,<note place="margin">Propterea facit ut nota ſint fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta ipſorum. <hi>Bez.</hi>

                     </note> by his viſible judgements. Wrath ſeen, may give us a ſight of ſin. Some inſiſt much upon this expoſition; and 'tis a truth, the Lord by his judgments brings to light, and doth as it were ſpread open, as in the face of the Sun, the wickedneſs and wicked deeds of mighty men: that all may know his judgements are deſerved by their works, he makes their works known.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others render, <hi>He maketh them know or acknowledge their works;</hi> The Lord at laſt by ſore, and ſevere judgements, will extort confeſſions from the worſt of them, he will make the mighty acknowledge that their works have been nought, and their wayes perverſe. In Scripture the ſame word ſignifies to know, or to confeſs and acknowledg. Thus here, he makes them to know or to acknowledge what their works have been.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Rather take it, as we render,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </note> of Gods act in taking notice of all they had done; <hi>Therefore he knoweth their works:</hi> As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid, theſe mighty men of the earth, thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under covert, or that the Lord took no notice of them, nor of their works, their works were done in the dark, and they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Lord could not pierce into them; but he will make it appear, that he knew their works, when he maketh his juſtice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in puniſhing them for their works.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>We have an aſſurance that God knoweth the works of all mon, becauſe he puniſheth all wicked works, or the works of the wicked ſo punctually and exactly.</q>
                  <p>He puniſheth many of them here, and will puniſh them all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: when we ſee him breaking the mighty men of the world, 'tis a proof that God was in their Cabinet counſels, and ſaw what was done there, we may conclude he knew their works, though men knew them not; he could never lay his judgements ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:104248:355"/> upon them as he doth, if he did not know their works: That God knows the works of all men, is a point I have met with before, and therefore paſs from it here.</p>
                  <q>And he overturneth them in the night.</q>
                  <p>There are ſeveral readings of this clauſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some thus, <hi>Therefore the Lord knoweth their works, and turneth into night;</hi> that is, he turneth their proſperity into adverſity, he bringeth trouble and affliction upon them; they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before in a day of proſperity, in a day of power and worldly greatneſs, but he turneth them into night.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Or, as others thus, <hi>He turneth the night,</hi> that is, he changeth the night into day,<note place="margin">Simul atque mutavit noctum &amp;c. <hi>Jun.</hi> i. e. Lucem protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit, qua reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantur omnia in judicio ejus. <hi>Id.</hi>
                     </note> he takes away the dark and cloſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their ſins, and makes them as manifeſt as the light; Now, as the Apoſtle ſaith (<hi>Eph.</hi> 5.13.) <hi>That which maketh manifest, is light;</hi> If God were not light, he could not <hi>bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, nor manifest the counſels of the heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly thus, <hi>Therefore he knoweth their works, and when the night is turned, he deſtroyeth them;</hi> that is, they are deſtroyed and periſh as ſoon and as eaſily as the day takes place of the night; or as ſoon as the night is turned into day, ſo ſoon doth the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, he can quickly make an end of them, he can deſtroy them with the morning light.</p>
                  <p>We render, and I judge that beſt, <hi>He overturneth them</hi> (their perſons) <hi>in the night;</hi> and ſo <hi>Elihu</hi> points at the ſeaſon, or time, of Gods breaking and overthrowing them, he doth it <hi>in the night.</hi> We may take it ſtrictly, as in the caſe of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 12.29.) as alſo in that of <hi>Belſhazzer, (Dan.</hi> 5.30.) or, <hi>in the night,</hi> that is, ſuddenly, unexpectedly; Though a man be deſtroyed in the day, yet if it be done ſuddenly, he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for no ſuch matter, we may ſay it was done in the night; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then men are moſt ſecure: This way of expreſſing an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookt for evil, the coming of in the night, was opened at the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth verſe, therefore I ſhall not ſtay upon it, <hi>He overturneth them in the night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>So that they are deſtroyed.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaid before <hi>He ſhall break in pieces mighty men;</hi> Here he ſaith, <hi>they are deſtroyed;</hi> that is, they ſhall be broken to purpoſe,
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:104248:355"/> or throughly; God doth not break them in pieces for correction, but for deſtruction; there are great breakings upon the perſons and eſtates of ſome men, and yet it is but for correction; others the Lord breaketh for utter ruine, (as here) <hi>ſo that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</hi> The Original word ſignifieth to deſtroy as it were by pounding in a Morter;<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, atirivit, contudit.</note> and the ſame word is uſed to ſignifie <hi>a contrite heart, a heart broken by godly ſorrow under the ſenſe of ſin. They are deſtroyed,</hi> or, as it were ground to powder; you may break a thing into many pieces, yet not grinde it to powder or duſt, as corn in a Mill; or ſpice in a Morter; but theſe (ſaith <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihu</hi>) are not only broken to pieces, but beaten to duſt, that's the ſtrength of the word which we render, <hi>they are deſtroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>What God hath a mind to do, he can do it certainly, and will do it throughly.</q>
                  <p>He breaks men in pieces, <hi>ſo that they are deſtroyed and brought to dust;</hi> When the Prophet declares the breaking of the four Monarchies, it is ſaid (<hi>Dan.</hi> 2.35.) <hi>They ſhall be as the chaffe of the Summer threſhing upon the Mountains;</hi> if the Lord will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the mightieſt, they ſhall certainly be deſtroyed; as <hi>Balak</hi> ſaid to <hi>Balaam; I wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that whom thou curſest are curſed;</hi> as if he had ſaid, thou canſt curſe effectually, if thou wilt ſet thy ſelf to it; 'tis not in the power of all the <hi>Balaams</hi> in the world to effect a curſe, though they pronounce a curſe, 'tis only in the power of the Lord to curſe effectually; he can bleſs whom he pleaſeth, and they are bleſſed; he can curſe whom he pleaſeth, and they are curſed. Thus as <hi>Ephraim</hi> lamenting his ſin and ſorrow confeſſed, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18.) <hi>Lord, thou hast chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed;</hi> God paid him home (as we ſpeak) if we chaſtiſe a childe, he is chaſtiſed, but) when <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſaith, <hi>thou hast chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed;</hi> his meaning is, I was greatly and effectually cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed; that is, firſt, In a literal ſence, I found thy hand heavie upon me, it was a ſore affliction that I was under. Secondly, In a ſpiritual ſence; <hi>Thou hast chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed;</hi> that is, my heart was humbled and broken under thy chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; in either notion we ſee the effectualneſs of the Lords work; <hi>Thou hast chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ephraim</hi> invited the Lord to another work; <hi>Turn me, O Lord,
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:104248:356"/> and I ſhall be turned;</hi> if thou wilt but turn thy Spirit upon this hard heart of mine, it will be effectually turned, it will be not only broken for ſin, but from ſin: As if he had ſaid, I have received reproofs and counſels from men, and they have not turned me, but Lord, if thou wilt reprove and counſel me, I ſhall be turned; thus the Lord carrieth his work home to converſion, in his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual dealings with ſome, and to confuſion in his temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon others. Thus he threatned his owne people for their confidence in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and contempt of his holy word (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 30.13.) <hi>This iniquity ſhall be unto you as a breach ready to fall, ſwelling out in a high wall, whoſe breaking cometh ſuddenly at an inſtant. And he ſhall breake it as the breaking of a potters veſſel, that is broken in pieces, he ſhall not ſpare; ſo that there ſhall not be found in the burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, a ſherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withall out of the pit;</hi> that is, ye ſhall be made utterly uſeleſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable. That piece of a veſſel is of no uſe, which will not ſerve for either of thoſe little uſes, the taking of a little fire from the hearth, or a little water out of the pit. And if God ſometime breake his owne profeſſing people thus ſmall for their ſins, how ſmall will he breake his profeſſed enemies! read for this the laſt breaking and down-fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> (Rev: 18.21, 22, 23.) Therefore take heed how you fall into the Lords hand; for he can not only break you in pieces, but break you to powder, he can break you to deſtruction: <hi>The Lords purpoſes, and the effects of them, his works, are never without effect, for good or evil, for the better or for the worſe.</hi>

                     </note>Theſe words are a further deſcription of the manner how God ſtrikes the wicked, he doth it openly, or (as we put in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin) <hi>In the place of beholders,</hi> that is, in ſuch a place, and in ſuch a manner that all may behold it: we ſay, <hi>He ſtrikes them in the open ſight of others;</hi> that is, he puniſheth them in an exemplary way, or that they may be an example of warning unto others. For, <hi>The place of ſeers,</hi> or <hi>of beholders,</hi> is ſome open and eminent place op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ'd to a Corner; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayd pleading his cauſe before king <hi>Agrippa</hi> (Acts 26.26.) <hi>This thing was not done in a Corner;</hi> no, it was done, as upon the houſe-top, even in the place of beholders. The Lord will not have to doe with wicked men only in a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. He will have witneſſes of his doings with them. There ſhall be enow to take notice how he handles them, therefore he often takes open vengeance on them, in the frequent aſſembly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of many beholders, both approving and reverencing, yea adoring the impartiall equity of the ſupreame Judge, and his care of humane affaires. So then, the words are an alluſion to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Common malefactors, who dye by the Judgement of the Magiſtrate, ſuch being condemned and ſentenced by the Judge, are not put to death in the priſon, or in a hole, but are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out and carried to ſome noted place of execution, or a Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold is purpoſely erected, where a multitude of ſpectators are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to come and behold the Tragedy. When our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who (to deliver us from our tranſgreſſions) <hi>was numbred with tranſgreſſors,</hi> when he (I ſay) was crucified, The Evangeliſt ſaith (<hi>Luke</hi> 23.35.) <hi>The people ſtood beholding, and the Rulers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with them derided him.</hi> Chriſt himſelfe was ſtrucken as a wicked man in the place of Beholders. And ſo have many thouſands of his faithfull witneſſes. The wicked deale with them often, as the Lord dealeth ſometimes with wicked men, they are brought forth from priſon to death, and executed in the open ſight of others. <hi>All things</hi> (in this world) <hi>come alike to all, no man knoweth love or hatred by all that is before them</hi> (Eccl: 9.1, 2.) The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of himſelfe and his fellow-Apoſtles (to ſhew the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick diſgrace which they were put to) ſaith, <hi>We are made a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:104248:358"/> to the world, to Angels, and to men</hi> (1 Cor: 4 9.) The Greeke is, we are a <hi>Theater to the world,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſayd, all ſee how we are uſed; And as bloody perſecuters make the faithfull ſervants of Chriſt a ſpectacle, ſo Chriſt will at laſt make wicked men a ſpectacle to the world, to Angels, and to men. Thus it is prophecied (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 66.24.) that <hi>all fleſh who come to worſhip before the Lord, ſhall goe forth and looke upon the carcaſſes of the men that have tranſgreſſed againſt him,</hi> &amp;c. They ſhall be <hi>ſtricken in the place of Beholders or Seers.</hi>

                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>God oftentimes doth Juſtice upon ſinners openly.</q>
                  <p>The Judgements of God are of two ſorts: Some are ſecret, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are manifeſt; he can doe execution upon men when none ſee it; nay he doth the ſevereſt executions upon ſome men when they themſelves doe not ſee it (that's the ſting and ſeverity of the Judgement, that) they have not ſo much as any ſence of the wrath of God, when the full vialls of his wrath are powring out upon them. But many of the Judgements of God are open; As he ſtriketh ſome ſo ſecretly, that none can ſee it, ſo others ſo viſibly that all may ſee it. Thus the Lord commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> (Numb: 25.4.) when <hi>Iſrael</hi> had joyned themſelves unto <hi>Baal-peor, Take all the heads of the people and hang them up before the Lord againſt the Sun.</hi> By <hi>the heads of the people,</hi> we may underſtand either the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall offenders, thoſe who were moſt active and ready in that wickedneſſe; or their principall Rulers, who in ſtead of ſtopping them from or puniſhing them for thoſe offences, gave way to them or at leaſt wincked at them: Theſe muſt be hanged againſt the Sun, that is, as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeakes here, <hi>in the open ſight of others,</hi> or, <hi>in the place of ſeers.</hi> Thus they were made an example of caution that all might ſee and feare and doe no more preſumptuouſly. Read the like executions of divine Judgement threatned (2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 12.11, 12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.11.) <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> (Chap: 15.4.) prophecyeth of the Saints triumphing at the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:104248:359"/> ſinging the ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the ſong of the Lambe, ſaying, <hi>Great and marvellous are thy workes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for thy Judgements are made manifeſt:</hi> God hath now ſtricken <hi>Babylon</hi> his great enemy in the open ſight of others; his Judgements were right before, (they are alwayes right) but till then not manifeſt. <hi>David</hi> ſaith (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 9.16.) <hi>The Lord is knowne by the Judgement which he executeth:</hi> now if the Lord be knowne by the Judgement which he execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth; then the Judgement which he executeth muſt be knowne; it muſt be an open Judgement; and ſuch are very many of the Judgements of God, they are acted as upon a ſtage. And I may give you an account in three particulars why the Lord will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doe Juſtice, <hi>in the place of beholders, or in the open ſight of others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, That there may be witneſſes enow of what he doth, and ſo a record of it kept, at leaſt in the minds and memories of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men for the generations to come.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord doth it not onely that he may have wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his Juſtice, but alſo that his Juſtice and the proceedings of it, may have an effect and a fruit upon thoſe who did not feele it, nor fall under it. This was the reaſon why the Lord threatned to puniſh <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the ſight of the nations (<hi>Ezek:</hi> 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 14, 15.<note place="margin">Jeruſalem dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur medium ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae, ut pote quae ſu in quarto cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ideo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem urbem in medio mundi conſtitutam et quiſi in loco videntium ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git deus, ut ſicut beneficia ita et ſupplicia eorum omnibus eſſent conſpicua. <hi>Pined:</hi>

<pb n="697" facs="tcp:104248:359"/> the nations round about ſeeing the ſufferings of that people for their ſin, might feare and tremble to ſin as they had done; for if <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the ſeate of inſtituted worſhip and Gods peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were not ſpared when they provoked God, their neighbours might well conclude, ſurely we ſhall not be ſpared: As the Lord himſelfe argued it againſt thoſe uncircumciſed nations (<hi>Jer:</hi> 25.20.) <hi>Behold I will bring evill upon the City that is called by my name, and ſhould ye goe utterly unpuniſhed?</hi> Certainly no! If God puniſh his own people in the ſight of the heatheniſh nations when they doe wickedly, what then are heathen nations to expect, who doe nothing but wickedneſſe?</p>
                  <p>And this (by the way) may give the Alarme, and be a very awakening conſideration to all the Churches and people of God at this day throughout the world. If God did ſtrike <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of old, that is, his people there, <hi>as wicked men</hi> even in the open ſight of others; if the Lord was ſo <hi>wroth with his people, that he polluted his inheritance, and gave them into the hand of the Chaldeans</hi> (Iſa. 47.6.) <hi>If he forſooke his houſe and left his heritage, and gave the dearely beloved of his ſoule into the hands of her enemies</hi> (Jer: 12.7.) and ſayd (<hi>v.</hi> 9.) <hi>Mine heritage is to me as a ſpeckled bird, the birds round about her are againſt her;</hi> yea if he (in the cloſe of that verſe) invited the worſt of men under the name of beaſts to ſpoyle them, <hi>Come ye, aſſemble all the beaſts of the field come to devoure;</hi> Now (I ſay) If God ſtruck his ancient people, the Jewiſh Church, as wicked men, by wicked men, in the open ſight of others, O let the Gentile Churches take heed, leſt they alſo be ſtricken after the ſame manner. Many Churches in <hi>Germany</hi> and elſe-where have been ſtricken ſo already in this laſt age, let the remnant both there and elſe-where remember themſelves and give glory to God, before he cauſe ſuch darkneſſe to come upon them, and ſtrike them alſo <hi>as wicked men in the open ſight of others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God lets ſome ſinners ſuffer or puniſheth them openly, both becauſe he would have all others take notice that he diſlikes what they have done, as alſo becauſe he would not have others doe the like, leſt they be made like them, both in the matter and manner of their ſufferings. <hi>'Tis a favour (as well as our duty) to be taught by other mens harmes, and to be inſtructed by their ſtroakes, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as the Lord ſtrikes ſome wicked men openly, that others
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:104248:360"/> may feare and not doe the like, ſo, that they who have done the like may be humbled for, and repent of what they have done. God doth not alwayes powre out the ſame Judgements upon all thoſe that have done the ſame wickedneſs, (the whole world would be in blood if he did ſo) but he takes here and there one that the reſt bethinking themſelves, and (with repenting <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi>) ſmiting upon their thigh, may prevent the Lord from ſmiting them at all, eſpecially from ſtriking them as wicked men in the open ſight of others. It is ſayd (<hi>Rev:</hi> 11.13.) <hi>that, after by a great earth-quake the tenth part of the City fell, and in the earth-quake were ſlaine of men ſeven thouſand, the remnant were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted and gave glory to the God of heaven.</hi> And ſurely the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why after one man hath been chaſtiſed or ſtricken, others take their turnes too, is becauſe they did not take warning by his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements and ſufferings. Did we but mind the ſcope of God in puniſhing any openly, the ſtriking of one might ſave hundreds, or thouſands from being ſtricken; but becauſe men are ſo ſecure and ſo ſlow to take warning by what God doth to others, therefore they are called forth one after another, to ſuffer and feel his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy hand in their own perſons.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God ſtrikes ſome wicked men in open view, or in the place of beholders for the comfort of his own people, and for their encouragement (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 58.10, 11.) <hi>The righteous ſhall be glad when he ſeeth the vengeance;</hi> not that he ſhall be glad of the vengeance, purely as it is a hurt, or a ſuffering to the creature, but the righteous ſhall be glad when he ſeeth the vengeance of God, as it is a fulfilling of the threatning of God againſt the ſin of man, and an evidence of his own holineſs. (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 64.9, 10.) <hi>God ſhall ſhoot ſuddenly at the wicked, all that ſee them ſhall flee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi> that is, they that ſee how God deales with them, ſhall get away, leaſt ruine overtake them, or they ſhall flee away (which is their beſt courſe) from ſuch courſes and practices as procured them that ruine. Thus the righteous rejoyce when they ſee the vengeance, yea <hi>they waſh their feere in the blood of the ungodly;</hi> that is, they get comfort and encouragement by ſeeing the Lord avenge their cauſe againſt their adverſaries. It is ſayd (<hi>Exod:</hi> 14.30, 31.) that God having overwhelmed the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the red Sea, <hi>the Iſraelites ſaw the Egyptians dead upon the ſhoar;</hi> God did not ſuffer the carcaſſes of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to ſink to the bottom of
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:104248:360"/> the Sea, but cauſed them to lie upon the ſhoar, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might ſee them: And when <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaw that dreadfull ſtroak of the Lord upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> It is ſayd, <hi>The people feared the Lord, and believed the Lord and his ſervant Moſes:</hi> Thus they were confirmed in their faith by Gods open Judgements upon the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> They were ſmitten <hi>in the place of beholders, or in the open ſight of others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are yet two other interpretations of theſe words, which I ſhall touch.</p>
                  <p>He ſtriketh them in the <hi>place of beholders,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In loco viden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium. <hi>i. e.</hi> exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flentes in ſtatu in quo videre poterant tum per naturalem rationem tum per ſacram do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinam quid eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet faciendum et quid eſſet vitandum. <hi>Aquin:</hi>
                     </note> that is (ſaith my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) in ſuch an eſtate or condition wherein themſelves might ſee, both by that natural light which every man hath, &amp; eſpecially by the light of doctrine and inſtruction, what they ought to doe, and what to ſhun or avoyd. In this ſenſe to be ſmitten in the place of Seers, is, to ſee and behold, to have light and underſtanding what to doe, or forbeare doing, and yet to act againſt that light, and ſo provoke the Lord to ſtrike us; which is a great aggravation both of the ſin, and puniſhment of man.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond gives it thus, <hi>He ſtriketh them in the place of ſeers,</hi> or where they ſaw; that is, he ſtriketh them in the eye of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or in their Judgement, he ſtriketh them with ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all blindneſs, as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> were with corporall, ſo that they are not able to ſee their way, or what becomes them to doe. This is a moſt ſevere ſtroake. There are many who when they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed the light, and would not doe what they ſaw they ought, God hath ſtruck them with ſuch blindneſs, that they ſhould not ſee what they ought to doe. Both theſe are rather tropologicall Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions then literall, yet they may have their uſe and improvement by way of alluſion. In this place <hi>Elihu</hi> having thus held out the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penneſs and exemplarineſs of the judgements of God upon wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, proceeds in the following words, to ſhew the equity and righteouſneſſe of them.</p>

But there are many who morally turn back and depart from the living God. Sinners would turn their perſons back from God, and hide their heads, they would get quite out of his ſight and reach, though they cannot; but all of them turn back from God in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>In two reſpects ſinners in generall, may be ſayd to turne back from God; Firſt, when he commands and they will not obey him, or withdraw their obedience from his commandements; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he entreates and invites them, and they will not come to him, nor accept his tendered reſpects and favours. Thus the Lord complained of his owne people (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 81.11.) <hi>Iſrael would none of me;</hi> God wooed them, but they had other lovers, and after them they would goe; even <hi>Iſrael</hi> lightly regarded the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yea they made a defection from him. More diſtinctly.</p>
                  <p>There is a three-fold turning back from God, or they who turne back from God are of three ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is a turning back from God, by thoſe who have openly followed him, or made profeſſion of his name; Thus hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and formaliſts turne back from God. This the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls back-ſliding, revolting, and going a whoring from God. Such as theſe, are like perfidious Souldiers, who enter and liſt themſelves in an Army, marching with them for a while, &amp; taking their pay, yet ſoon after forſake their colours, and turn to the enemy: Thus many apoſtatize from God to the Devill, and to the creature, or (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayd of <hi>Demas) they forſake Chriſt and embrace this preſent world. Luther</hi> was charged by his enemies that he was an Apoſtate, and he acknowledged, he was, but he thanked God for it, he indeed turned back from what he did once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, but it was to a better profeſſion; he did not turne from God to the world, but he turned from the world to God, and that's a
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:104248:361"/> bleſſed Apoſtacy; he did not turn from truth to error, but from error to truth; he did not turn from pure worſhip to Idolatry and ſuperſtition, but from Idolatry and ſuperſtition to pure worſhip. How wretched is their condition who are indeed Apoſtates! who turn from God to the world, from truth to error, from pure wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to Idolatry and ſuperſtition, from a holy converſation to prophaneſs, looſneſs and liberteniſme, to a complyance with the world, and a ſymbolizing with them in their luſts and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. This abominable apoſtacy is a fruit of hypocriſie, <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites turne only their faces to God, and Apoſtates turne their backes upon him,</hi> or, <hi>turn back from him.</hi> And all they <hi>who turn only their faces unto God, will for their owne advantage, or to ſave themſelves turn their backs upon him. Hypocrites when put to it, when the ſtorme comes, ever prove Apoſtates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a turning from God found even in the beſt followers of God; who is there among the Saints on earth that keepes conſtant un-interrupted communion with God? The leaſt degree of inordinate letting downe or turning the heart to the creature, is, a degree of turning back from God. As holineſs is our motion toward God, and to act holyly is to keep the eye of the ſoule alwayes upon God; ſo, unholineſs, is an averſion from God. <hi>David</hi> did not ſay, nor could he ſay (though as holy a man as lived) that he had never turned from God; he could only ſay that he had not <hi>wickedly departed from God</hi> (Pſal: 18.21.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a turning back from God, proper to all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate perſons, whether they be ſuch as are civilly honeſt and poſſibly ſuch as doe not decline the outſide of that religion wherein they were borne and bred; or ſuch as are flagitious in their lives and wayes, ſcorning to own religion, and being even aſhamed of the wayes of God. Theſe may be ſayd <hi>to turn back from God,</hi> becauſe they have many calls to God, and are invited to come unto him; which yet they either neglect and mind not at all, or refuſe and reject, and ſo thruſt away God from them; and when the light comes, they <hi>love darkneſs rather then light, becauſe their deeds are evill</hi> (Joh: 3.19.) Such were they of whom <hi>Job</hi> ſpake (<hi>Chap:</hi> 21.14.) <hi>They ſay to God depart from us:</hi> he doth not intend it of Apoſtates in a ſtrict notion, who once made profeſſion of godlineſs; but he ſpeakes of common and prophane perſons, who have no mind at all to obey or walk with God, but
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:104248:362"/> mind only the fullfilling of their luſts, or the affayres of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life; and ſo their whole life is nothing elſe but a turning from God.<note place="margin">Qui quaſi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> Thus the vulgar tranſlation renders the text with a good ſignificancy, though not with a clearneſs to the Hebrew; <hi>who have purpoſely turned from God;</hi> diſtinguiſhing them from thoſe who through dayly Infirmity turn from God, as the beſt of his people do; whereas, theſe ſin willingly, yea wilfully and reſolvedly againſt God. I conceive, the words of <hi>Elihu</hi> in this text are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of turning from God in this third ſence; For he is not here ſpeaking of thoſe who were eminent profeſſors before, and did Apoſtatize; much leſs of thoſe that turn from God by dayly fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in duty, or ſome neglect of duty; but he is ſpeaking of ſuch, whoſe whole courſe of life is as a continued turning from God, themſelves never having been wrought upon by the grace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, or ſavingly turned to him. This third ſort of turners back from God are moſt proper to the preſent text, though ſuch alſo are within the reach and compaſſe of it, who doe wickedly after they have made faire pretenſions to the beſt things. This is the reaſon why God ſtriketh the mighty to deſtruction; <hi>They have turned back from God.</hi> The reaſon being thus explicite and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, teacheth us,</p>
                  <p>Firſt.</p>
                  <q>God never puniſheth any man without cauſe.</q>
                  <p>God doth not alwayes ſhew the cauſe why he puniſheth this or that man, but he never puniſheth any man without cauſe; if he ſtriketh, 'tis becauſe men turn back from him, either by a plain apoſtacy from what they once profeſſed, or by a notorious courſe of impiety, refuſing ſo much as to own his wayes or make profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. God electeth ſome, and paſſeth by others without reſpect to any thing in them; <hi>Jacob have I loved, and Eſau have I hated; God hath mercy on whom he will have mercy</hi> (Rom: 9.13, 15.) thus, I ſay, God electeth us without reſpect to any good in us; but God never ſtriketh or puniſheth us, but with reſpect to ſome evill in us or done by us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>It is the duty of all men to follow after God.</q>
                  <p>To follow God in his way, and to propoſe God as our end, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:104248:362"/> the ſumme of all duty. That, God hath made man and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him a being, that, he placed man in the higheſt forme of his viſible creation, ſhould draw man after him. We ought to follow God becauſe we are his creatures, becauſe we have our all from him, or becauſe <hi>in him we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeakes of mankind in generall, even of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens (<hi>Acts</hi> 17.28.) And foraſmuch as <hi>we are his off-ſpring (v.</hi> 29.) our hearts ſhould ſpring, or riſe up to him in love and thankfullneſs; as the rivers, becauſe they come from the Sea, goe back thither: ſo we being the off-ſpring of God, and derived from him, ſhould be alwayes returning to him. This nature tells us; And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith (<hi>Acts</hi> 17.27.) <hi>God hath made of one blood all nations of men, that they ſhould ſeek after him, &amp;c.</hi> The light of nature, though dim and dark, ſhews that a man ſhould feele after God, as a man in the dark doth after his way. And if all men ought to follow God, becauſe they have their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life and breath from him; much more ſhould believers, who have a new, a ſpirituall life breathed into them, and beſtowed upon them, be alwayes following after God; And the truth is, where true faith, or the life of grace is, that ſoule cannot live without dayly returnings back to and breathings after God, even as meere carnal men, who are alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, are dayly turning back from him.</p>
                  <p>Hence thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>The whole life of every unconverted ſoule, and notorious ſinner, is a turning from God.</q>
                  <p>They who ſet their faces ſin-ward, turn their backs God-ward. They who purſue their luſts, their covetous, their ambitious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, they who gratifie the fleſh, their pride, their luxury, their wantonneſs, their malice, what doe any of them, what doe all of them, but turn back from God? The beſt of Saints have their turnings from God, but they doe not make it their buſineſs to turn from him; their buſineſs is, to draw near, to keep cloſe to God, to keep as it were in his eye; but as for the naturall man and groſs ſinner, his buſineſs is a departing from God (<hi>Heb:</hi> 3.12.) <hi>Take heed</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>leſt there be in any of you an evill heart of unbelief in departing from the living God.</hi> He gives Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:104248:363"/> to the Church, ſearch your ſelves, leſt there be found in any of you an evill heart of unbelief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where unbelief remaines in any meaſure unmortified, it may quickly doe a great deale of miſchiefe. And where it remaines in full power or altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified, it doth all manner of miſchiefe. All which is wrapt up in that one word, <hi>a departure from the living God.</hi> Unbelief is the root of Apoſtacy; The reaſon why ſinners turn from God, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they give no Credit to the word of God; they are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded God is ſuch a one as he hath declared himſelfe to be, and will either doe that for the obedient which he hath promiſed, or that againſt the rebellious which he hath threatned. They who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not in God cannot but depart from God; And therefore the life of an unbeliever is a continuall departure from God. He ſets out with his back upon God; the very firſt ſtep he takes into the world is from God. As ſoon as we are borne we naturally goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray ſpeaking lyes; we are ever out of our way, till we look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, and ayme at him; which we never doe, till he by his mighty power changeth our hearts, turneth our courſe, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us home to himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Further, Conſider, how did theſe mighty men turn back from God? they might ſay, where did we ſee God? where did God appeare to us? that we are thus charged with turning back from him?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; Firſt, God manifeſts himſelfe to man in his workes, or in his providences. Secondly, He manifeſts himſelfe in every part of his word, eſpecially in his Commands, in his promiſes, and in his threatenings; in his Commands, he manifeſts himſelfe a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God; in his promiſes, a gracious and bountifull God; in his threatenings, a juſt and righteous God, who will neither do wrong nor ſuffer himſelfe to be wronged.<note place="margin">

<pb n="705" facs="tcp:104248:363"/> to you in the diſpenſation of the word, if you doe not obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientially cloſe with it, you neglect to cloſe with God himſelfe, and while you turn from it, you turn from God himſelfe. Thus the Apoſtle ſpeakes concerning back-ſliders (2 <hi>Pet:</hi> 2.20, 21.) <hi>If after they have eſcaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt they are againe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled therein and overcome, the latter end is worſe with them then the beginning. For it had been better for them not to have knowne the way of God, then after they have knowne it, to turn from the holy commandement delivered unto them;</hi> ſo that, a turning from the Commandement of God, is a turning from God himſelfe; He turneth back from the holy commanding God, who turneth back from the holy commandement of God, and he turneth back from the God of the promiſe, who turneth back from the promiſe of God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Note.</p>
                  <q>As it is exceeding ſinfull to turn back from God, ſo they who doe ſo, grow every day more and more ſinful.</q>
                  <p>If a man be once upon a courſe of back-ſliding and Apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing from the commands and promiſes of God, he will find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe worſe and worſe day after day; for ſtill the further from God any man goeth, the more vaine he groweth; and the more doth luſt get a hand over him. As unbeliefe is the roote of Apoſtacy from God, ſo Apoſtacy encreaſeth all that wickedneſſe which is in man. As the cauſe of all evill, whether of puniſhment or of ſin, is our departure and turning from God; ſo the very nature of ſin is a turning from God; and therefore the more we turne from God, the more ſinfull and the fuller of ſin we are. As the neerer we come to God, the more holy and ſpirituall and heavenly we are (<hi>while we with open face as in a glaſſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 3.18.) <hi>Behold the glory of God</hi> (that is, while we draw neere to him in his holy ordinances) <hi>we are changed into the ſame image,</hi> that is, we become more like to God) ſo the more we keep at a diſtance from God, the more unlike we are to him, that is, the more unholy we are. And as perſons unconverted, or in an unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate, are wholly alienated from the life of God, and cannot endure to come neere him; ſo it is in a degree by any of our withdrawings or turnings from him: we are made more unholy,
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:104248:364"/> and are changed more into the image of thoſe carnal and earthly things which we behold, and with which we over-intimately converſe in the time of thoſe withdrawings.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Note.</p>
                  <q>A holy life conſiſts in following of and keeping cloſe to God.</q>
                  <p>To keep cloſe to God is both a holy and a comfortable life; 'Tis the perfection of Saints to walk with God: <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, and that was his holineſs (<hi>Gen:</hi> 5.24.) <hi>Caleb</hi> followed God fully,<note place="margin">Optima viven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di ratio eſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſequi.

                     </note> and that was his holineſs. A ſpirituall life, is nothing elſe but our following God. <hi>The moſt religious worſhip of God is to imitate whom we worſhip.</hi> And our imitation of God is our follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, no man can imitate any thing but when his eye is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its pattern, or the Idaea of it abides in his mind. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſayd of the ungodly man (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 10.4.) <hi>God is not in all his thoughts</hi> (then followeth, <hi>v.</hi> 5.) <hi>his wayes are alwayes grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.</hi> If God be not in the thoughts of a man, nothing of God is ſtampt upon the wayes of that man. In vaine are we called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, unleſs we keep cloſe to Chriſt, and in vaine doe any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to godlineſs, unleſs they walke with God. Jeſus Chriſt hath called himſelfe <hi>the way</hi> (Joh 14.6.) chiefly upon this account, becauſe by him we goe to the Father, and have acceptance with God by the grace of Juſtification; but Jeſus Chriſt is the way al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, of our Sanctification; we muſt walke in him, and as he walked (1 <hi>Joh:</hi> 2.6.) that we may be holy: every departure from God lets the heart looſe to ſin. That which ſhall maintaine the Saints holineſs to Eternity, is, <hi>They ſhall alwayes behold the face of God;</hi> they ſhall never turn back from God, they ſhall never be taken off one moment from the actuall viſion, enjoyment and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of God in glory; therefore they ſhall never be taken off from actuall holineſs and purity, now in proportion, as we keep our hearts and ſpirits ſteady upon God, and doe not turn back from him, ſuch is our holineſs in this life; and as our holineſs is, ſuch will our comfort and peace and joy be in this life. For as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when we arrive at glory, we ſhall never turn back from God, much leſs turn our back's upon him, therefore in glory there is fullneſs of Joy, and pleaſure for evermore; ſo the neerer we keep to God, and the cloſer we walke with him in this life, the fuller and more laſting will our joyes and pleaſures be.</p>
                  <pb n="707" facs="tcp:104248:364"/>
                  <p>As in this former part of the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, we have had the firſt cauſe opened why God ſtriketh the mighty as wicked men in the open ſight of others, namely, their apoſtacy from God, <hi>Becauſe they turned back from him.</hi> So in the latter part of this verſe we have another reaſon aſſigned why God doth it, and that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

And this word is often (in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conjugation) uſed in the title of ſome ſpeciall Pſalmes. The 32<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Pſalme, as alſo the 42<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Pſalme, is called <hi>Maſchil,</hi> as much as to ſay, <hi>a teaching, or an inſtructing Pſalme, a Pſalme gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving underſtanding and requiring deep and ſerious conſideration.</hi> Thus in the text, they would <hi>not conſider, nor underſtand, nor know, nor contemplate</hi>
                     <q>any of his wayes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>all his wayes;</hi> that is, none at all of them. The wayes of God in Scripture are taken in a two-fold notion; Firſt, for thoſe wherein he would have us walk; ſuch are the wayes of his commandements: they are called the wayes of God, becauſe he directs us to walke in them. A holy life conſiſts in our walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, and we cannot walke with God any further, or any longer, then we keep in the wayes of his commandements. It is ſayd of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after the death of <hi>Joſhua (Judg:</hi> 2.17.) <hi>they turned quickly out of the way, which their fathers walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, obeying the commandements of the Lord; but they did not ſo.</hi> To obey the commandements, is to walke in the way of them. Taking the wayes of God in this ſence, when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>They would not conſider any of his wayes,</hi> his meaning is, they did not intend nor had any heart to ſet themſelves to learne the mind of God revealed in his word concerning their duty, or what they ought to doe; they know not the wayes of God practically. The word properly denotes the wiſdome and prudence, which ſtayeth not in notion, but proceeds to action. Theſe men lived as if they
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:104248:365"/> had never heard of,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

They conſidered not the wayes of God to walke in them, as <hi>Moſes</hi> exhorted the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (Deut: 29.9.) <hi>Keep therefore the words of this covenant to doe them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly; The wayes of God are thoſe wherein himſelf walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the works of God are the wayes of God; the works of his providence either in mercy or in judgement, either in doing good or in doing evil (that is, poenal evil) theſe are the wayes of God; in theſe God ſhewes himſelf as in a way, in theſe he goeth forth in his power and goodneſs, in his mercy and juſtice. All theſe divine glories and perfections are diſcovered in the works of God. Thus <hi>David</hi> is to be underſtood when he ſaith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.10.) <hi>All the wayes of God are mercy and truth, to them that fear him, and keep his Covenant;</hi> that is, all the providential works of God are mercy and truth; though all of them are not mercy in the matter, or preciſely taken as works done, though none of them are mercy, reſpecting ſome perſons to whom they are done, for many of them are materially chaſtiſements, afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and croſſes to good men, and all of them are wrath and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to evil and impenitently wicked men; yet they are all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the iſſue or reſult of them to good men, or to thoſe who fear God, and keep his covenants. For whether he do good, or whether he do evil, whether he wounds, or whether he heals, all theſe providential wayes of God, are as truth in themſelves, ſo mercy to his people; or, as the Apoſtle concludes (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28.) <hi>They work together for good to them that love God, and are the called according to his purpoſe.</hi> In both theſe ſences we may expound this Text, <hi>They would not conſider any of his wayes;</hi> that is, they would neither conſider the Lawes of God, which were the way wherein they ſhould walk towards him, nor would they conſider the works of God, which are the wayes wherein himſelf walketh towards them. This was the ſpirit of that evil generation intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Scripture; they had not much underſtanding in, and leſs conſideration of the wayes of God.</p>
                  <p>Hence, firſt we may take notice, <hi>Elihu</hi> doth not ſay, <hi>they did not conſider his wayes;</hi> but, <hi>they would not;</hi> It was not ſo much an act of careleſneſs and negligence as of contempt and rebellious reſolution.</p>
                  <pb n="709" facs="tcp:104248:365"/>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Evil men have no will to conſider or underſtand the good wayes of God; yea, their will is against ſuch an underſtanding.</q>
                  <p>A natural man <hi>liketh not to retain God in his knowledge,</hi> (Rom. 1.28.) Now, he that doth not like to retain God in his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or had rather think of any thing then of God, he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (while ſuch) like to retain the wayes of God in his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; he that layeth God out of his thoughts, will much more lay the law of God out of his thoughts. The natural man hath not only a blindneſs in his minde, which hinders him from diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things of God, (they being diſcernable only by a ſpiritual eye) but he hath an obſtinacy in his Will; or, he hath not only an inability to know, but an enmity againſt the knowledge of that which is ſpiritual: He ſhuts his eyes, and draws a curtain between himſelf and the light which is ready to dart in upon him; <hi>away with this light,</hi> ſaith he; Thus he rebelleth againſt the light, and as his underſtanding is dark, ſo his affections are corrupt. <hi>Solomon</hi> gives us all this in the expoſtulations of wiſdome with wicked men, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22.) <hi>Wiſdome cryeth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>How long ye ſimple ones will ye love ſimplicity, and the ſcorners delight in their ſcorning, and fools hate knowledge?</hi> That which a man hateth, he hath no will, no minde to know. An impotency or inability unto God, argues a very ſad condition, but a rebellion, a frowardneſs, a wilfulneſs againſt it, demonſtrates a condition much more ſad; not to know becauſe we have no means of knowledge, will make us miſerable enough, but not to know becauſe unwilling to receive, or becauſe wilfully ſet againſt the means of knowledge, renders any mans condition moſt miſerable. Such were theſe in the Text, <hi>They would not conſider any of his wayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith not, <hi>they did not know any of his wayes,</hi> or they knew not which way to go; but they would not conſider them. There is no man but knowes ſome, yea many of the ways of God, that is, of thoſe wayes wherein God would have him to walk; theſe wayes of God are written in the heart by nature, there is an impreſſion of the Will of God upon every ſoul, though not ſuch an impreſſion or writing as grace maketh there (that's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kinde or manner of work) for, when once through grace the Law of God is written in, and impreſſed upon the heart, then the
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:104248:366"/> heart is ſuited to the Law, yea, the heart is not only conformed unto, but transformed into the Law of God, whereas by nature the Law is written only ſo far as to give us the knowledge of the Law, and a conviction of that duty or conformity which we owe to it. The men here intended by <hi>Elihu,</hi> knew the Law or wayes of God, by the light of a natural conſcience, but not by the light of a renewed conſcience, and therefore they <hi>would not conſider any of his wayes,</hi> which is a farther deſcription of the heart of man in a ſtate of Nature.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>That which a natural man knoweth of the will of God, he will not conſider, unleſs it be to reject and turn from it.</q>
                  <p>I (ſaith Wiſdome, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, 25.) <hi>have ſtretched out my hand,</hi> (as a Teacher doth to his hearers or diſciples) <hi>and no man,</hi> (that is, no meer natural man) <hi>regarded, they ſet at nought my counſel, and would none of my reproof.</hi> Let me ſay what I would, they would at moſt but give me the hearing, they would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it; though the light ſhined in upon them, and they could not chuſe but ſee ſomthing, yet they would not ſit down and rowl it in their thoughts, and work it upon their hearts, to finde out the excellency of what they ſaw. It is a very great meaſure of ſinfulnes not to know the wayes of God, but not to conſider what we know, but lightly to paſs it by, that is a greater meaſure of ſinfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, comparing this aſſertion concerning wicked men, <hi>they would not conſider any of his wayes,</hi> with their practice in the former part of the verſe, <hi>they turned back from God,</hi> and with the effect of it in the verſe following, <hi>they made the cry of the poor to come up to him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>The reaſon why men are ſo wicked, and act ſo wickedly, is, becauſe they minde not the Word of God.</q>
                  <p>They who conſider not the rule of the Word, are far both from righteouſneſs towards man, and holineſs towards God. If once a man throw aſide the Word of God, where will he ſtay? He will neither abide in any wayes of holineſs, nor will he abide in any wayes of righteouſneſs; they cannot make conſcience of the wayes of God, who will not conſider the wayes of God. We have this clear character of a wicked man, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.) he is one that will
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:104248:366"/> poſſibly take the covenant of God in his mouth, he will be talking of it, his tongue may be tipt with it, but (<hi>verſ.</hi> 17.) <hi>he hateth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and casteth the words of God behinde his back.</hi> He that would conſider a thing, holds it before his eye, and keeps it, as much as he can in ſight; therefore the Lord, when he would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Zion how much he did conſider her caſe, though ſhe had ſaid a little before, <hi>God hath forſaken me, and my God hath forgotten me,</hi> yet preſently the Lord ſaith, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.15, 16.) <hi>Can a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man forget her ſucking childe, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the ſon of her wombe? Yea, they may, yet will not I forget thee;</hi> (what follows?) <hi>Behold I have graven thee upon the Palms of my hands, thy walls are continually before me.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, you may be ſure I will conſider your caſe, for I have you here pourtrayed upon the palms of my hands, and am alwayes viewing your walls, either as ruin'd and demoliſhed, to move me to pity, or in that ſtrong &amp; beautiful model according to which I purpoſe to raiſe them up again, or re-build them. Thus I ſay, both God and man intending to conſider any thing, have it alwayes before them; but what a man hath no minde to conſider, he caſts it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde his back; <hi>thou caſtest my words behinde thy back,</hi> ſaith God to the hypocrite, and when once the hypocrite hath got the word behinde him, then he is ready for any wickedneſs (<hi>verſ.</hi> 18, 19, 20.) <hi>When thou ſawest a thief, thou conſentedst with him, and hast been partaker with the adulterer,</hi> &amp;c. Whence was all this? he had caſt the word behinde his back. It is <hi>David's</hi> queſtion, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6.) <hi>Wherewithal ſhall a young man cleanſe his way?</hi> The anſwer is, <hi>By taking heed thereto according to thy word;</hi> that is, by continual eying of the word, and of his way, and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them together. They that will make right work, muſt be alwayes eying the rule; if once you lay by the rule, you will make but crooked, or bungling work: When the rule of righteouſneſs is laid by, righteouſneſs is laid by too. Theſe mighty men of whom <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaketh would not conſider any the holy wayes of God, and you ſee what ill favour'd work they made, what ſoul wayes they walked in.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Text doth not ſay they would not conſider ſome, or ſuch and ſuch of his wayes, but <hi>any of his wayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>A wicked man liketh, delighteth in, or loveth no one way of God better or more then another.</q>
                  <pb n="712" facs="tcp:104248:367"/>
                  <p>He is as much out with all as with any, they are all alike to him, that is, he likes none of them; <hi>they would not conſider any of his wayes.</hi> He that hateth one truth of God, hateth all truth, though poſſibly his hatred is not called out or acted againſt ſome truths; and he that hateth one law of God, hateth all his laws, though poſſibly his luſts are not drawn out againſt ſome of them. The reaſon why the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, (<hi>chap.</hi> 2.10.) <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all,</hi> is, becauſe if a man hath a minde to ſin againſt one branch of the law, that evil principle will carry him to ſin againſt any branch of it: If he be not ſtopt from without, he findes no ſtop within againſt the worſt of ſins, as it is a ſin.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, We tranſlate <hi>any,</hi> the Original word is <hi>[all]</hi> his ways, which imports a refuſing of every one of his wayes; there are ſeveral Scriptures of a like ſence (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.1, 2.) <hi>O praiſe the Lord, and forget not all his benefits;</hi> that is, forget not any one of his benefits; not that a man ſhall be excuſed, though he forget many of the benefits of God, or half his benefits, if ſo be he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not all, or remember ſome: but when that Scripture ſaith, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not all his benefits,</hi> the meaning is, forget not any one at all. Thus here, <hi>they conſidered not all his wayes,</hi> (that's the letter of the Text, and ſo M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Broughton</hi> tranſlates,) that is, none of them. Taking that reading, and the Scripture ſence given of it, it gives us this uſeful Obſervation.</p>
                  <q>That unleſs all the wayes of God be conſidered and obeyed, there is not any one of them conſidered or obeyed.</q>
                  <p>God will not be obeyed by halves; he muſt have entire obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, univerſal obedience, or he owneth none; there is a band or tye between all the commandments of God, and unleſs you keep them all, you break them all; they that ſubmit not to all, ſubmit to none of his laws. It is not enough for a man to ſay he is no adulterer, if he be a thief; or to ſay he is not a murderer, if he bears falſe witneſs. He that doth the one in act, doth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his heart; nothing hinders him but the abſence of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, or of an opportunity, the Law doth not.</p>
                  <p>Further, <hi>[they] would not conſider any of his wayes.</hi> Who were they? No fools I dare ſay, either in their own opinion, or in the opinion of men. Doubtleſs thoſe mighty men ſpoken of by <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu,</hi>
                     <pb n="713" facs="tcp:104248:367"/> were worldly wiſe men; they were the mighty, the great men of the world, and they are commonly very conſidering men, as well as very conſiderable men; they are knowing men, as well as men much known; they are men of counſel, and ſit in councel to debate difficult matters, and of greateſt outward concernment; theſe things they could conſider exactly, and weigh them to a grain; but they would not conſider any of God's wayes.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>There is nothing ſo little regarded by ungodly men, as the wayes of God are.</q>
                  <p>Though they have wiſdome and ability to underſtand and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider earthly things, yet they will beſtow none of it upon the things of heaven. Chriſt rebuked <hi>Martha</hi> when he ſaw her ſo buſie about worldly buſineſs, (<hi>Luke</hi> 10.41.) <hi>Martha, Martha, thou art</hi> careful and <hi>troubled about many things, one thing is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; Martha</hi> had ſome care about the one thing needful, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not ſo much as ſhe ſhould, Chriſt gave her a gracious check and reproof for it: How much more may Chriſt come and rebuke the men of the world, ye are careful about many things, ye are wife conſidering men about your profits and preferments, thoſe ye can think of all night long; but there is one thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, my wayes, my word, my commandments are to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what account can ye give of or concerning them?</p>
                  <p>Farther, this <hi>non-conſideration</hi> of the wayes of God is brought as a charge, as a high charge againſt thoſe mighty men; not only were they bad men who did not conſider the wayes of God, but this was a part, yea I may ſay the whole of their badneſs, that they did not conſider the wayes of God.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>Not to conſider the wayes of God, is in it ſelf a very great ſin.</q>
                  <p>The omiſſion, or non-performance of what is good, is as ſinful as the commiſſion or doing of that which is evil. Not to do good is to do evil; eſpecially when it is the not doing of ſuch a good duty as opens a way to the doing of all evil. Should we ſuppoſe a man not chargeable with the breaking of any commandment of God, yet if we could charge him that he did not conſider the commandments of God, this were the breaking of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:104248:368"/> For as they are all to be conſidered that we may keep them, ſo if we conſider them not, we cannot keep them. 'Tis the deſcription of a godly man, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2.) <hi>His delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth he meditate day and night.</hi> Meditation is nothing elſe but conſideration. A godly man meditates or conſiders day and night what the Law or Word of God is; not that he thinks of nothing elſe but the Law of God day and night, for then he muſt throw off his Calling; but the meaning is this, he is very ſedulous and watchful of all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities both night and day, to get and keep his heart up in holy meditation; and why is he ſo much in holy meditation? 'Tis ſurely, that he may be much, yea alwayes in holy action; and when it may be ſaid of a man, that his meditation is not in the Law of God, neither day nor night, or that he never conſiders the wayes of God, this is an undeniable evidence that he neither keeps in the way, or obſerves any one line or letter of the Law at any time. It is our ſin, and that no ſmall one, not to conſider our own wayes, how much more is it ſinful not to conſider the wayes of God! To conſider our own wayes, is a great part of our work: If we conſider not our own wayes, they will ſoon be crooked wayes. The Prophet adviſeth the Jewes, (<hi>Hag.</hi> 1.5.) <hi>Conſider your wayes;</hi> the Text is, <hi>Set your heart upon your wayes;</hi> that is, ponder your wayes; as if he had ſaid, the reaſon why your feet are ſo often in bad wayes, is, becauſe your hearts are ſo ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome upon your wayes. Now, if not to conſider our own wayes be ſo ſinful, and ſubjects us to every ſin, then much more is it ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to conſider the wayes, the word and truths of God, and much more doth the neglect of this lead or lay us open and obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to every ſin. This neglect is not only a ſpecial ſin in it ſelf, and an effect of ſin, but the general cauſe of all other ſins: What ſin is not, or may not be found in the wayes of thoſe men, who conſider not the wayes of God?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Sin makes men ſtupid, and transforms them into fools.</q>
                  <p>He that is not a conſidering man, is a weak and a fooliſh man; every wiſe man is a conſidering man; and the more a man is ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in conſideration, the more wiſe he is, and the wiſer he grows. The wicked man is often called a fool in Scripture, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:104248:368"/> no better a title; when he is called ſo, he is both ſerved and called in his kinde (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1.) <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God.</hi> The thoughts of the heart are the ſayings of the heart; and ſin hath made a wicked man ſo much a fool, that as he knowes not how to ſay any thing of God, which is honourable, with his tongue, ſo all that his heart can ſay, that is, think of God, is, that God is not; which as it is the higheſt blaſphemy, ſo the deepeſt piece of folly and irrationallity that ever was hatcht in the heart of man. Sin makes dull-heads, it ſtupifies the ſoul; ſinners conſider not that, at any time, which is their intereſt as much as their duty to conſider of at all times, the wayes of God, as taken for the wayes wherein man ought to walk towards God.</p>
                  <p>Again, If we take the wayes of God in the ſecond notion, for the wayes wherein himſelf walks towards man, uſually called his works, or the wayes of his providence.</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>It is the mark of an ungodly man, not to conſider the works and providences of God, how God walketh towards him, or what he doth in the world.</q>
                  <p>(Iſa. 1.3.) <hi>I have nouriſhed and brought up children;</hi> that is, I have done for my people as a father for his children; but what follows? <hi>My people doth not know, Iſrael doth not conſider:</hi> They conſider not what I have done for them, as well as not what I have ſpoken to them; they conſider not how I have nouriſhed and brought them up, as well us not how I have inſtructed and given them counſel; and from this neglect God infers, (<hi>verſ.</hi> 4.) <hi>Ah ſinful Nation, a people laden with iniquity, a ſeed of evil doers,</hi> &amp;c. they quickly proceed to the doing of all evil againſt God, who conſider not of the good which God doth or hath done to them. Read this ſin, the not conſidering of the works of God, with the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of all the works of thoſe unconſidering men, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.4, 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.11, 12.) The Scripture makes frequent mention how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ill the Lord takes it at the hands of men, when his works are not conſidered by them, when they regard not the operation of his hands. Indeed God doth much in the world, he walketh in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dark and hidden wayes, which though we conſider, we cannot fully underſtand; <hi>Thy way</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aſaph,</hi> Pſal. 77.19.) <hi>is in the ſea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy foot-ſteps are not known.</hi>
                     <pb n="716" facs="tcp:104248:369"/> God hath many inviſible works both of mercy and of judgement; yet we ſhould be, though not curiouſly, yet ſeriouſly ſearching, as much as poſſibly we can,<note place="margin">Arcana imperii.</note> even into thoſe wayes of God which are unſearchable; we ſhould conſider, though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſearch them out. But as for thoſe works of God that are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and plain, which are written as it were with the beams of the Sun, which are ſo plain and obvious, that he who runs may read them, to neglect the conſideration of theſe, or lightly to paſs them by, how ſinful is it! Thoſe works of God which are moſt plain, have wonders in them, if we could finde them out. As in the plaineſt Text of Scripture there is a world of holineſs and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alneſs; and if we in prayer and dependance upon God did ſit down and conſider it, we might behold much more of thoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders then yet appear to us: It may be at once reading or looking we ſee little or nothing, as <hi>Elijah's</hi> ſervant, when he went once, he ſaw nothing, therefore he was commanded to look ſeven times; What now, ſaith the Prophet? O now I ſee a cloud riſing <hi>like a mans hand;</hi> and by and by the whole ſurface of the heavens was covered with clouds. So you may look lightly upon a Scripture, and ſee nothing, and look again, and ſee little, but look ſeven times upon it, meditate often upon it, and then you ſhall ſee a light like the light of the Sun. 'Tis thus alſo with the works of God, we paſs many of them by as ſmall matters, but when through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, there is a wonderful depth in them; now not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thoſe wayes of God wherein he is ſo viſible, and which are the actings and exerciſing of his power, goodneſs, wiſdome, and faithfulneſs, this muſt needs be a very great ſin, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.11.) <hi>Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not ſee,</hi> (they take no notice of it, much leſs lay it to heart) <hi>but they ſhall ſee,</hi> (they ſhall be made to ſee one way or other,) <hi>and be aſhamed for their envie at the people,</hi> or (as the margin hath it,) <hi>towards thy people.</hi> As god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men ſee the hand of God, and are both confirmed and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his mercy to his people, ſo wicked men ſhall ſee, and be both aſhamed and confounded, becauſe they both envyed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God that mercy, and oppoſed it. They who will not ſee the works of God to give him glory, ſhall ſee them to their own ſhame. God hath given us his works of Creation, that we ſhould conſider them daylie, as <hi>David</hi> did (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.3.) <hi>When I conſider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the Moon, and the Stars which
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:104248:369"/> thou hast ordained; What is man!</hi> &amp;c. How was the Pſalmiſt raviſht with that contemplation? And ſo may we, while we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the works of Providence, whether works of judgement, or works of mercy; whether vengeance upon the wicked, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance for the godly.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore ſet our ſelves to this ſoul-raviſhing, and God-exalting work, the conſideration of the works of God: And we are the more engaged to do it, becauſe God hath fitted man, among all creatures in this lower world, (and he hath only fitted man) to give him glory by conſidering his works. The beaſts of the earth cannot glorifie God by conſidering his works; 'tis true, both they, &amp; the fowls of the ayr, with the fifh of the ſea, according to their kinde, praiſe God; but man only is fitted and furniſhed with an intellect or underſtanding faculty to conſider, and ſo to draw out from all the works of God, thoſe peculiar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies which make his Name glorious: Now, for man to leave ſuch a faculty unexerciſed and unacted, (as they who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not the works of God do) is not only a diſhonour to God, but a degradation of himſelf. <hi>As it is the priviledge and happineſs of a man to enjoy the benefit of the works of God, ſo it is his holineſs and his duty to conſider the beauty of them.</hi> And to all who brutiſhly lay by the works of God without conſideration, let me adde this conſideration; God conſiders all your works or wayes, and will not you conſider the works, the wayes of God! Of this be ſure, whether you conſider the wayes of God, his <hi>Word-wayes,</hi> or <hi>Work-wayes</hi> (of this be ſure) God will conſider your wayes, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he will; thoſe wayes of yours which in themſelves are not worth the conſidering or looking upon, your ſinful wayes, though they are ſo vile, ſo abominable, that if your ſelves did but look upon them and conſider them, you would be utterly aſhamed of them, yea though they are an abomination to God while he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds them, yet he will behold and conſider them. The Lord who is of purer eyes then to behold any the leaſt iniquity, to approve it, will yet behold the greateſt of your iniquities, and your impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt wayes to conſider them. Thou (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 10.14.) <hi>Thou beholdest miſchief and ſpite, to requite it:</hi> God beholdeth the fouleſt dirtyeſt wayes of men, their wayes of oppreſſion and unrighteouſneſs, their wayes of intemperance and laſciviouſneſs, their wayes of wrath and maliciouſneſs, at once to deteſt, detect
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:104248:370"/> and requite them. If the Lord thus conſidereth the wayes of men, even theſe filthy and crooked wayes of men; ſhould not men conſider the holy the juſt and righteous wayes of God? And that God conſiders all the wayes, the worſt of wayes of the ſons men appeares further in the next verſe.</p>

They would willingly have ſtopt the mouthes of the poore, that they ſhould not have cryed to God, and preſumed the eares of God would be ſtopt againſt their cry, let them cry as long as they would: they doe not ſay to the poore, goe and appeale to God, goe make your moane to God, (yet ſome have been thus impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently blaſphemous, when they have oppreſt the poore, to bid them, goe cry to their God) but here we are to underſtand it as the iſſue of the oppreſſion, not as the deſire of the oppreſſors.

The cry of the poore is their mournfull cry, their pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull lamenting cry; yet this cry may poſſibly be, not ſo much vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call as reall, not ſo much what the poore did make formally or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to God about their wrongs, but the very wrongs and evills which they ſuffered cryed to the righteous Judge of all the earth.

When oppreſſors have got all the money out of the purſes of the poore, when they have pull'd the bread out of their mouthes, and even drawne the blood out of their veines, then they (poore ſoules!) ſound out and ſend up their cryes to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <hi>So that they cauſe the cry of the poore to come up unto him.</hi>

                  <p>Turning back from God, brings in the non-conſideration of the word and works of God; The word and works of God, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered, brings in the workes of unrighteouſneſſe towards men, or oppreſſion of the poore.

                  <q>They are the worſt ſort of wicked who make poore men cry.</q>
                  <p>Oppreſſion is a ſin againſt the light and law of nature, as well as againſt the light and law of God; every ſin is the more ſinfull, by how much it is committed againſt more light of any kinde, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt more kindes of light; And thoſe ſins are extreamly high, which are committed againſt the loweſt and moſt common light, that of Nature.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>Oppreſſion will quickly cauſe a Cry.</q>
                  <p>(<hi>Iſa:</hi> 5.7.) <hi>I looked for Judgement, but behold oppreſſion, and for righteouſneſſe, and behold a cry;</hi> that is, the cry of the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. As the act of oppreſſion is a crying ſin, ſo the effect of it is crying; Oppreſſion cryeth loud, though the oppreſſed ſhut their mouthes in ſilence and ſay nothing, yet uſually the oppreſſed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbeare crying. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> (Chap: 5.3.) ſchooles the wicked rich men of the world, with, <hi>a Go to now weepe and howle,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Your riches are corrupt, and your garments moth-eaten;
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:104248:371"/> Behold the hire of the labourers which have reaped downe your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, cryeth, and the crys of them which have reaped are entred into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.</hi> As the poore labourers cryed, ſo their hire that was detained cryed alſo. The loud cry both of the oppreſſed and of oppreſſion is often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and recorded in Scripture, read (<hi>Exod:</hi> 2.23. <hi>Lam:</hi> 1.17. <hi>Chap:</hi> 2.18. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 86.14.) The oppreſſed who cry are in a ſad condition, but the condition of oppreſſors who make the poor cry is much more ſad; For, as the text hath it,
<q>The cry of the poore cometh up to God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though God ſhould not come downe to that, yet that cometh up to God. And when it is ſayd the cry cometh up to him, and not he at the cry. This intimates the cry of oppreſſion, a very loud cry, that's a loud cry that aſcends up to heaven; <hi>Cities wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up to heaven,</hi> are high-walled Cities, and cryes reaching up to heaven, are high-ſtrained cryes. The breach of a commandement makes a great crack, eſpecially when it is ſuch a breach as makes the poore cry too. If a Great houſe, or a Tower fall ſuddenly, what a noyſe doth it make? Certainly the unjuſt pulling downe of any poore man, is like the fall of a great houſe, or of a tower, it makes a noyſe that reacheth up to heaven; he doth not ſpeak of Gods coming downe. When <hi>Cain</hi> had ſlaine his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> the Lord ſayd (<hi>Gen:</hi> 4.10.) <hi>The voyce of thy brothers blood cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto me from the ground;</hi> and ſo the cry of <hi>Sodom</hi> came up to God, (<hi>Gen:</hi> 18.21.) The fall of a poore man makes a report as farre as heaven. Among men the fall of Princes and mighty men, makes a huge noyſe, all the world is filled with the fall of a Prince, 'tis told every where, A great Prince is fallen. But I tell you the fall of a poore godly man, of the meaneſt of the ſervants of God, makes a greater cry then the fall of the greateſt Prince in the world who is not ſo. The fall of a poore man by the oppreſſion of the wicked, poſſibly is not heard a mile from the place where it was done on eatth, yet it reacheth up to heaven; oppreſſion hath not only a voyce, but a very loud voyce. To wrong a rich man, who can beare the wrong and be a rich man ſtill, is a ſin which hath a voyce in it; but the ſin which the Scripture ſaith hath a cry in it, is the oppreſſing of a poore man. There is no liberty gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to wrong a rich man, and that would be conſidered; Some
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:104248:372"/> take a kinde of liberty, if he be a rich man that they are to put a reckoning upon, they thinke they may doe it ſomewhat largely, and ſay, <hi>he is able to beare it.</hi> But be the man never ſo rich and able to beare it, yet to wrong him is a ſin, and a ſin that God will take notice of to puniſh. And though he can beare the wrong done, yet the wrong-doer will hardly be able to beare it when he comes to reckon with God for it. Thus (I ſay) to wrong the rich offends God; but to wrong the poore cryeth to God; <hi>and</hi> as it followeth in the text.</p>
                  <q>He heareth the cry of the afflicted.</q>
                  <p>Many cryes come up to God which he doth not heare, he doth not regard them, and 'tis poſſible for a poore man to cry to God and God not heare him, in the ſence here ſpoken of; Some poore men cry (as we ſay) before they are hurt; they cry rather out of diſcontent then want, they cry becauſe they have not what they deſire, not becauſe they have not what they need. God will not heare the cry of ſuch, though poore: but when a poore man is afflicted, when a poore man that is humbled (as the word here ſignifies) and layd low in his ſtate, is low alſo in ſpirit, and lowly in minde, God heareth the cry of ſuch a poore man. If a poore man have a proud ſpirit, or is humorous, God will not heare him, though he cry. The word here rendred, <hi>afflicted,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies not only a man deſtitute of helpe, of ſtrength, of friends, of aſſiſtance,<note place="margin">

He heareth other cryes, he heareth the cry of the Ravens when they call upon him, and provides for them, much more will he hear the cry of Saints, the cry of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the cry of the humbled and humble.</p>

                  <q>The cry of the oppreſſed brings vengeance upon oppreſſors.</q>
                  <p>Read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.26. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.16. All theſe Scriptures teach this truth, that the cry of the oppreſſed brings vengeance on oppreſſors: Let the mighty remember, <hi>'Tis dangerous medling with Gods poor;</hi> 'tis dangerous medling with any poor, but moſt dangerous medling with Gods poor. Some will ſay, there is ſuch a great man, it is dangerous medling with him, and they are afraid to wrong him, they dare not do it; if ever (ſay they) he ſhould come to know it, he may break our backs, ſit on our skirts, and cruſh us with his power; but if they can get an underling, a man below them, they preſume there is no great danger in oppreſſing him; what can he do? if he bark, he cannot bite; if he hath a tongue, he hath no teeth; we can deal with him well enough. Thus, I ſay, men think it dangerous to wrong great men, but conclude they may do what they pleaſe with the poor, and thoſe that are underlings; but we ſhould more fear to wrong a poor man, then to wrong a rich man, though we ought not to do either; yet, I ſay, we ſhould more fear to wrong the poor then the rich, becauſe the poor are under the ſpecial prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the great God; they are under more promiſes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection then the great men of the world are. Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> gives that ſerious caution, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 23.10, 11.) <hi>Enter not into the
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:104248:373"/> Vineyard of the fatherleſs;</hi> (do not oppreſs the poor fatherleſs,) <hi>for his avenger is mighty, and God will plead his cauſe for him.</hi> You think you may do any thing with the poor and fatherleſs; O ſaith wiſe <hi>Solomon,</hi> take heed, do not invade the heritage of the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, (we are not to take the fatherleſs there in a ſtrict ſence, for thoſe whoſe parents are dead, but any that are poor and low, are fatherleſs, as the Prophet calls them <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.3.) <hi>In thee the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs findeth mercy;</hi> beware ſaith he how you deal with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, <hi>for his Redeemer is mighty:</hi> though he hath no might, yet he hath <hi>a mighty Redeemer, and he will plead his cauſe for him.</hi> Poſſibly the poor man cannot plead with thee, he cannot try it out with thee in Law, he cannot ſee an Advocate, but God can and will be his Advocate. Therefore you that dare not wrong the mighty for fear they ſhould cruſh you, be much more afraid to wrong the poor, for God is their avenger, and how eaſily can he cruſh you?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, This is matter of comfort to the godly poor, to the humble and meek; they may look for help from God in all their afflictions and hard uſages they meet with in this world from the hands of men; when men even eat them up as bread, and ride o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their heads as if they were but dirt, they may appeal to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and there have audience, they may r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The firſt part of the ſentence, rendred, <hi>when he giveth quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> is but one word in the Hebrew, we had it before (<hi>chap.</hi> 3.13.) where <hi>Job</hi> ſuppoſeth if he had died in his infancy, <hi>then ſhould he have been ſtill, and been quiet, he ſhould have ſlept, and been at reſt.</hi> The grave is a ſilent and quiet abiding place, the dead are quitted of all worldly unquietneſs.

                  </p>
                  <p>Or, as Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> renders, <hi>who can diſturb?</hi> Who can diſeaſe thoſe to whom God gives eaſe, or oppreſſe thoſe to whom God gives protection?

Such is the Emphaſis of the preſent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>When he giveth quietneſs, who then can make trouble?</hi> Where is the man, high or low, great or ſmall that can do it?</p>
                  <p>Further, the word which we tranſlate <hi>make trouble,</hi> hath a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold eminent ſignification in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It ſignifieth to <hi>be wicked,</hi> or to do wickedly; thus we read it at the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of this chapter, <hi>Surely God will not do wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> He that is altogether holy and righteous, doth all things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily and righteouſly. The ſame word ſignifieth to do wickedly, and to make trouble, becauſe to do wickedly bringeth trouble of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon others, alwayes upon the doers.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; it ſignifieth <hi>to condemn;</hi> thus we tranſlate, at the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of this chapter, <hi>Wilt thou condemn him</hi> (as one that hath done wickedly) <hi>who is moſt juſt?</hi> The ſame word may well ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to do wickedly, and to condemn, becauſe they who do ſo, are worthy to be condemned. In this ſenſe alſo we tranſlate it, in that famous Propheſie of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ipſo enim con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedente pacem, quis eſt qui condemnat. <hi>Vulg.</hi>
                     </note> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.9.) <hi>He is near that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth me, who ſhall condemn me?</hi> or make me wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous. Thus ſome render the minde of <hi>Elihu</hi> in this place, if <hi>he giveth peace or quietneſs, who can condemn?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The word ſignifieth, as we render, to <hi>trouble,</hi> moleſt, or vex; ſo we tranſlate (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.47.) where 'tis ſaid of <hi>Saul,</hi> that he <hi>fought againſt all his enemies on every ſide, againſt Moab, and againſt the children of Ammon, and againſt E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>bah, and againſt the Philiſtines; and whither ſoever he turned himſelf, he vexed, or troubled them.</hi> The word may be taken in theſe three ſignifications with a ſubſerviency one to another; for he that is wicked, or doth wickedly, deſerveth to be condemned, or, men are condemned becauſe they do wickedly; and he that is condemned by a righteous ſentence is puniſhed, and cannot but be troubled; a legal ſentence of condemnation, brings a legal
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:104248:374"/> penalty upon the perſon condemned; we tranſlate clearly to the ſence of the Text, <hi>who can make trouble,</hi> when God giveth qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs? for here the word is not oppoſed to well doing, or acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but to quietting and pacifying; <hi>when he giveth quietneſs, who can make trouble?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?</q>
                  <p>The face of God, by a well known Hebraiſme (very frequent in Scripture) ſignifieth the favour of God; Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> reads, <hi>when he hideth favour.</hi> The favour which we bear to others, is moſt viſible in the face, and therefore the face may well ſignifie favour. <hi>David</hi> over-looking all the good things of this world, prayed for a good look from God in this expreſſion, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6.) <hi>There be many that ſay who will ſhew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance</hi> (or <hi>of thy face) upon us:</hi> that is, ſhew us favour, or be favourable to us. And as the greateſt good of Saints in this world, ſo all the good of the next world is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this one word (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11.) <hi>In thy preſence</hi> (the text is, <hi>in thy face,</hi> that is, in the full enjoyment of thy benigne and gracious preſence) <hi>is fulneſs of joy.</hi> In like ſenſe the word is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 67.1. So then, <hi>to hide the face,</hi> is to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw favour, and kindneſs, love, and reſpect; more diſtinctly, this phraſe of <hi>hiding the face,</hi> hath a three-fold importance, or may hold out theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a diſtaſte either againſt perſons or things; we turn away our face from him, or that which we do not like, or is diſpleaſing to us. The hiding of Gods face is a manifeſtation of his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; <hi>In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment,</hi> ſaith God to the Church, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.8.) This form of ſpeaking is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from their uſage or practice, who refuſe to admit into their preſence, or ſo much as look upon ſuch, whom they either really hate, or would ſeem at leaſt to be much diſpleaſed with; As <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> gave command concerning <hi>Abſalom</hi> (2 Sam. 14.24.) <hi>Let him turn to his own houſe, and let him not ſee my face.</hi> When God withdraweth the wonted expreſſions of his love and kindneſs from a perſon or a people; then (according to Scripture ſenſe and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, he is ſaid to <hi>hide his face</hi> from them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.7.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The hiding of Gods face, notes a refuſal to help
<pb n="728" facs="tcp:104248:375"/> thoſe who in ſtraits cry to him for relief and deliverance: For if we will not give a man our eye, we will hardly give him our hand; if we will not ſo much as look upon him, we will hardly aſſiſt him. When God hides his face, 'tis as much as his denyal of ſuccour; Thus <hi>David</hi> bemoaned himſelf, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 13.1.) <hi>Why hideſt thou thy face?</hi> that is, Lord, why withdraweſt thou thy help from me? That he was ſenſible of ſuch <hi>withdraws,</hi> is plain by the prayer which he made, (<hi>verſ.</hi> 3.) <hi>Conſider, and hear me, O Lord my God;</hi> and by the reaſon of it given (<hi>verſ.</hi> 4.) <hi>Leſt mine enemies ſay, I have prevailed againſt him.</hi> We finde <hi>David</hi> deprecating the hiding of Gods face upon the ſame ground, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.17.) The Prophet is very expreſs in this point, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.1, 2.) <hi>The Lords hand is not ſhortned that it cannot ſave, neither his ear heavie that it cannot hear; but your iniquities have ſeparated between you, and your God, and your ſins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear:</hi> that is, as he diſtaſteth, and is diſpleaſed with you, ſo he denyeth you his uſual help and aſſiſtance, becauſe ye have great-ſinned againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the hiding of God's face, notes not only ſome diſtaſte, and a denyal of help; but a total ſlight, or refuſal of any care concerning us, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.27.) <hi>Why ſayeſt thou, O Jacob, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, O Iſrael, my way is hid from the Lord, and my judgement is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over from my God;</hi> that is, Why ſayeſt thou, the Lord takes no care at all of me, and in that ſenſe <hi>Job</hi> ſpake, (<hi>chap.</hi> 24.1.) <hi>Why ſeeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not, ſee his dayes?</hi> that is, why ſeeing God doth not neglect times, and ſeaſons, and how things go in the world, (there time is put for things done in time, why (I ſay) ſeeing God hath not caſt off the care of the things of this world) is it thus with me? Why am I as a man forlorn, and utterly caſt off? We may expound <hi>Elihu</hi> in all or any of theſe ſenſes; <hi>when he hideth his face,</hi> or withdraweth his favour that is, when God is diſpleaſed and refuſeth to help, when God throweth up the care of a mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or condition, it cannot but go and be ill enough with him; for as it followeth,
<q>Who then can behold him?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The face of God as taken for his eſſential being, cannot at all be ſeen, nor can we at all behold him; <hi>There ſhall no man</hi> (ſaith
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:104248:375"/> the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.20.) <hi>ſee my face, and live;</hi> But, as the face of God is taken for any manifeſtation of his being, whether in wrath or in love, in judgement or in mercy, ſo it may be ſeen: Now when God hideth his face, that is, his favour, and will not give out any pleaſing manifeſtations of himſelfe, <hi>who can behold him?</hi> that is, who can behold him with comfort? who can ſtand before an angry God? or abide his preſence? As the gracious preſence of God is the ſweeteſt, ſo the wrathfull preſence of God is the moſt bitter thing in the world. <hi>When he hideth his face, who can behold him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some expound thus; if God will not ſhew his face, if he is not pleaſed to reveale himſelfe, no man can know, or ſee any thing of him; that's a truth. We can know no more of God, then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe will reveale of himſelfe to us; 'tis <hi>in his light</hi> (Pſal: 36.9.) that is, in the light which he cauſeth to ſhine from himſelfe, that <hi>we ſee light,</hi> or what and who himſelfe is, <hi>who is light, and in whom there is no darknes at all.</hi> If God will hide his power, or his wiſdom, or his truth, or his mercy from us, who can ſee any thing of them? though all theſe perfections be alwayes more glorious in him then the beams of the Sun, yet unleſſe God ſhew them us, we cannot perceive them. We ſee the light of God in Gods light; if God hath a minde to conceale himſelfe, or draweth (as it were) a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine between the creature and himſelfe, <hi>who can behold him?</hi> we cannot by any ſtudy, or skill, or art, or endeavour of ours come to any ſight or knowledge of God, further then himſelfe makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe knowne. This expoſition is both true and uſefull; yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who then can behold him?</hi> his meaning rather poynts at theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Who can have any comfortable enjoyment of him; to behold a man whoſe diſpleaſure we ſuſpected, and find acceptance and freedome with him, is compared to our beholding the face of God. <hi>I have ſeene thy face as though I had ſeene the face of God and thou waſt pleaſed with me,</hi> ſayd <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Eſau</hi> (Gen: 33.10.) when his brother treated him ſo lovingly contrary to his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he looked upon it as an evidence of the favour of God to him. Or <hi>Jacob</hi> being much affected with the countenance and kindneſs of <hi>Eſau,</hi> compared his face to the face of God, becauſe in his reconciled face he ſaw (as it were) the face of God ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him. This was <hi>Davids</hi> argument, that God favoured
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:104248:376"/> him (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 41.11.) <hi>becauſe his enemies did not triumph over him;</hi> much more is it an argument of Gods favour, when they ſpeake and act friendly towards us, or when we behold their face and are accepted. <hi>Joſeph</hi> threatened his brethren, <hi>yee ſhall not ſee my face</hi> (or behold me) <hi>except your brother be with you</hi> (Gen: 43.3.) if you come without him, either I will not admit you at all into my preſence, or I will look ſowerly upon you. Thus to <hi>behold God,</hi> is to <hi>ſee his face</hi> (as 'tis ſayd (<hi>Chap:</hi> 33.26.) the repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſick man ſhould) <hi>with joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Who can have any confidence in him, or boldneſs with him; <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of godly and upright men, ſaith (<hi>Pſ:</hi> 34.5.) <hi>They looked</hi> (or, <hi>ſhall look) unto him, and were lightned, and their faces were not aſhamed;</hi> that is, they beheld God or came to him, with much aſſurance of his favour. Some dare not ſo much as look another in the face, for ſhame or feare; but when we look a man in the face, it ſheweth we have either confidence in him, and freedome with him, or courage enough againſt him. Now, if God hide his pleaſed face, or withdraw his favour, <hi>who can behold him</hi> confidently, or come to him with hopes to ſpeed. Fierce <hi>Abner</hi> ſayd to <hi>Aſael</hi> (2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 2.22.) <hi>Turne thee aſide from following me, wherefore ſhould I ſmite thee to the ground</hi> (I could eaſily doe it, and he did it preſently) <hi>how then ſhould I hold up my face to Joab thy brother.</hi> As if he had ſayd, I can have no confidence to come to <hi>Joab,</hi> thy Generall, if I ſhould kill thee. Guilt of evill done to others, drawes a jealouſie that others will do evill to us, eſpecially they who are neerely concern'd in the evill which we have done; we cannot hold up our face to or behold them with expectation of acceptance and favour, to whoſe neere relations we have been unkind or injurious. Thus, <hi>if God hide his face who can behold him?</hi> either with confidence or with comfort.</p>
                  <p>Some referre the relative <hi>him (who can behold him?)</hi> to man, not to God; as if the meaning of <hi>Elihu</hi> were this; <hi>if God hide his face from any man, all men will hide their faces from him too; no man will looke kindly upon ſuch a deſerted perſon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quis favorem ei exhibebit, a quo deus vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum averterit. <hi>Druſ:</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>or give him a good look; he ſhall have but frownes from men, from whom God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth his favour;</hi> that's a truth; He that is out with God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep in long with men. Uſually all ſorts diſowne him that is forlorne and forſaken of God, As <hi>when a mans wayes pleaſe God</hi> (becauſe then God is pleaſed with him) <hi>his enemies ſhall be at
<pb n="731" facs="tcp:104248:376"/> peace with him</hi> (Pro: 16.7.) ſo when God is diſpleaſed with a man, his very beſt friends ſhall turne enemies to him. Yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the text carrieth it rather the other way, referring to God himſelfe; <hi>If God hide his face, who can behold him?</hi> that is, who can confidently behold God, or draw neere to him with comfort? And ſo it generally comes to paſſe, or thus it is,
<q>Whether it be done againſt a nation, or againſt a man only.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſayd; What I have affirmed, that, <hi>when God giveth quietneſs, no man can make trouble, or when he hideth his face no man can behold him,</hi> is appliable to whole nations, as well as to particular perſons. This is an extenſive truth, a truth of large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, and therefore a truth of neceſſary and important conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.

                  <p>
                     <hi>When he giveth quietneſs to a nation, who can make trouble or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe the peace of it.</hi> And the text may well reſpect that national bleſſing, <hi>peace,</hi> becauſe the word tranſlated <hi>giveth quietneſs,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies ſuch quietneſs primarily, as is oppoſite unto warre, ſedition, and tumult in a nation (<hi>Joſh:</hi> 11.23.) <hi>And the land reſted from warre,</hi> it is this word, ſo (<hi>Judg:</hi> 3.11.) <hi>The land had reſt forty yeares.</hi> (Judg: 3.30.) <hi>And the land had reſt fourſcore yeares.</hi> (2 Chron: 14.1.) <hi>In his dayes the land was quiet ten yeares.</hi> (Zech: 1.11.) <hi>And behold all the earth ſitteth ſtill, and is at reſt;</hi> in all theſe places we have the word here rendred <hi>quietneſs,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to warre; who knows not how great an unquietneſs warre makes whereſoever it comes? and by a like analogie, the word is ſometimes rendred <hi>to be ſilent.</hi> Warre is full of clamour (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 9.5.) <hi>Every battell of the warrier is with confuſed noiſe.</hi> Not only is it ſo in ſome battells, but (ſaith that Scripture) 'tis ſo in all bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, <hi>Every battel of the warrier is with confuſed noiſe.</hi> What a noiſe is there in an Army, eſpecially when joyning battell with another Army? what beating of drums? what ſounding of trumpets? what neighing of horſes? what claſhing of armour? what groanings of the wounded? When God gives quietneſs or peace, there is none of this noiſe, none of this confuſed noiſe of the warrier. <hi>Hannah</hi> ſaith in her ſong (1. <hi>Sam:</hi> 2.9.) <hi>The wicked ſhall be ſilent in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> that is, either they ſhall be deſtroyed and thruſt into their graves, where there's nothing but rottenneſs and ſtench; darkneſs and ſilence; or they ſhall be ſo affrighted &amp; confounded with the horror and darkneſs of thoſe miſeries which ſhall come upon them while they live, that they ſhall not have a word to ſay, the mouth of iniquity ſhall be ſtopt. In this manner the wicked are ſilent in
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:104248:377"/> darkneſs; but the Lord can make his people ſilent in light, that is, he can give ſuch quietneſs as ſhall at once ſilence the noiſe of warre and all their own complaints. <hi>When he giveth quietneſs</hi> (this bleſſed ſilence to nations) <hi>who then can make trouble?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The quietneſs or peace of nations is the peculiar gift of God.</q>
                  <p>Whoſoever hath or enjoyeth quietneſs, 'tis Gods work, but moſt eminently when nations enjoy it. Of nationall quietneſs the Lord ſpake by his Prophet (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 45.7.) <hi>I forme the light,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I make peace, I the Lord doe all theſe things.</hi> As naturall ſo civill light is of Gods forming; as ſpirituall; ſo temporall peace is of Gods making. And the Church was confident he would be their <hi>peace-maker (Iſa:</hi> 26.12.) <hi>Lord thou wilt ordaine peace for us.</hi> Some read it as a prayer, <hi>Lord doe thou ordaine</hi> (or command) <hi>peace for us;</hi> we as a profeſſion of their faith and hopefull if not full aſſurance that the Lord would ordaine peace for them. The Lord gives out an order, or makes an ordinance in heaven, when he pleaſeth for the peace both of Churches and nations here on earth. And the Church there had this good ground of their aſſurance, that he would doe it, even their former experiences of his great power and goodneſs in doing much for them, as it followeth, <hi>for thou haſt wrought all our workes for us;</hi> As if they had ſayd, Lord thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſervations which thou haſt heretofore given us in trouble, and deliverances out of trouble, ſtrengthen our faith both in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thou wouldeſt, and in believing that thou wilt, now at this pinch ordaine peace for us. To doe ſo is a mighty and a mercifull worke of God, and we may conſider it two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As the giving of quietneſſe to a nation is the reſtoring of peace, or the ſetling of them in a quiet ſtate, after they have been torne and troubled with warres and toſſed with continuall tempeſts of trouble (poſſibly) for many yeares together. To bring peace out of warre, and quietneſs out of unſetledneſs, is a worke worthy of God. (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 46.9.) <hi>He maketh warres to ceaſe to the ends of the earth;</hi> that is, all the world over. The end or ceaſing of warre is quietneſs. And to aſſure us that the Lord can make an end of warres, the Pſalmiſt in that place ſheweth us the Lord ſpoyling all the implements, or inſtruments of warre, <hi>He breaketh the bow, and cuts the ſpeare aſunder, he burneth the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:104248:378"/> in the fire;</hi> Here are three great inſtruments of warre, the bow, the ſpeare, the chariot, all which are ſometimes comprehended under that one word the <hi>ſword,</hi> which is the moſt knowne and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal inſtrument of warre. Now, when neither ſword, nor bow, nor ſpeare, nor chariot, are to be had, we need not feare warre. And therefore that great promiſe of peace runs in this tenour (<hi>Mic:</hi> 4.2.) <hi>They ſhall beat their ſwords into plow-ſhears, and their ſpeares into pruning hooks</hi> (then preſently followeth) <hi>nation ſhall not lift up a ſword, againſt nation, neither ſhall they learne warre any more;</hi> There muſt needs be peace when the art of warre is layd by as uſeleſſe, and ſhall be learned no more. That will be a bleſſed time indeed when the art military ſhall be out of date, and (being it ſelfe the greateſt interrupter of learning) ſhall be learned no more. When Souldiers ſhall turne Husbandmen and Vine-dreſſers, <hi>beating their ſwords into plow-ſhears, and their ſpeares into pruning hooks,</hi> then we ſhall have peace, and put away the remoteſt feares of warre. When a man caſteth away his ſword, we may very well conclude he intends to be quiet. Thus the Lord gives quietneſſe, to nations, which have been engaged in warre, by cauſing warres to ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He gives quietneſſe to nations by continuing their peace, when warres are ceaſed; for unleſſe the Lord give a check to the luſts and paſſions, to the wrath and rage of men, plow-ſhears are quickly turned into ſwords, and pruning hookes into ſpeares. To preſerve peace is the Lords worke, as much as to give peace. It requires the ſame or as great a power to keepe our peace as to make it;<note place="margin">Non minor eſt virtus quam quaerere, parta <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ueri.</note> to keepe it out of the hand of the ſword, as to get it out of the hand of the ſword. When the king of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> threatned <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with a ſiege, the Lord preſerved their peace, and ſent <hi>Hezekiah</hi> word (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 37.33.) <hi>He ſhall not come into this City, nor ſhoote an arrow there, nor come before it with ſhields, nor caſt a banke againſt it, for I will defend this City to ſave it.</hi> The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of peace, and quietneſſe, is a continuall giving of it. Warres returne after peace, as clouds returne after raine, unleſſe the Lord prevent and forbid them.</p>
                  <p>And have not we of this nation reaſon to acknowledge this double mercy.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Was not the end of our late unnaturall warres, the gift of God? was it not he that made our troubles to ceaſe from one
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:104248:378"/> end of the nation to the other, yea throughout the three nations? If the Lord had not given the ſword a check, or counter-mand, if the Lord had not called in the commiſſion which he once gave the ſword, it had been devouring fleſh, and drinking blood to this very day. We read (as it were) a dialogue between the Prophet and himſelfe concerning the ſword (<hi>Jer:</hi> 47.6, 7.) <hi>O thou ſword of the Lord,</hi> (ſayd the Prophet being grieved for the ſlaughter and deſolation which the ſword had made even in a ſtrange land) <hi>how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thy ſelfe into thy ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard; reſt and be ſtill;</hi> Himſelfe anſwers himſelfe; <hi>how can it be quiet ſeeing the Lord hath given it a charge againſt Aſhkelon, and againſt the Sea-ſhore? there hath he appointed it.</hi> I ſpake to the ſword of quietneſſe (ſaith the Prophet) But alas! how can it be quiet, how can that ſheath it ſelfe in its ſcabbard, and not in the bowels of men, ſeeing the Lord hath given it a charge againſt <hi>Aſhkelon?</hi> As if he had ſayd, I ſee no entreaties can perſwade the ſword to reſt and quietneſs, till it hath fully executed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, and done his work, though it be very bloody work, even the making of it ſelfe drunke with blood. The Lord can make the ſword quiet; &amp; it will hearken to no voyce but his; if the Lord give a charge for the ſword to returne into the ſheath then it will, and if not, it will not. The ſword raged in theſe nations till the Lords work and will was done, and then that had done. And as we have reaſon to acknowledge, that the Lord hath commanded the ſword back into its ſheath, and given us peace out of warre, ſo</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That he hath continued our peace ſince the warre, <hi>When he giveth quietneſſe, who then can make trouble?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>If God will give thoſe nations quietneſſe, where it was not, or continue it where it is, there is no power on earth can ſtop, or interrupt it.</q>
                  <p>Who can make trouble; where he ordaineth peace? <hi>Balaam</hi> was forced to this confeſſion (when he would have troubled the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and went from mountaine to mountaine to ſeek divination) <hi>I cannot curſe whom the Lord hath bleſſed;</hi> why not, ſaid <hi>Balak,</hi> I will give thee a good fee if thou wilt, no, ſaith <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> (Numb: 23.20.) <hi>The Lord hath bleſſed and I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe it.</hi> We may put this query, <hi>When he giveth quietneſſe, who
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:104248:379"/> can make trouble?</hi> eſpecially to three ſorts of perſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To politick men; ſome preſume they can trouble nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſhake the ſureſt foundations of peace, with the engine of their braine, with their wit and ſubtlety. Yet this engine proves uſeleſſe and unſerviceable to that end, where the Lord gives qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe. <hi>Ahitophell</hi> was as an oracle of God for wiſdome in his times, and he ſtretcht his braines upon the tenters to make trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but God ſayd there ſhould be peace, and therefore (as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> prayed) <hi>his wiſdome was turned into fooliſhneſs. There is no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſe, <hi>Pro:</hi> 21.30.) <hi>nor underſtanding nor counſel againſt the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may put the queſtion (who can make trouble?) to mighty men; their power (the ſtrength of their Armies, and arme) cannot doe it? <hi>Senacharib</hi> came with a mighty hoſt to diſturb <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but he could not make trouble, he could not ſo much as ſhoot an arrow againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when the Lord forbad it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We may put the queſtion (who can make trouble?) to magicall men or ſorcerers; They cannot doe it by their wiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes and enchantments, by their cloſeſt correſpondencies with the devill himſelfe. This was <hi>Balaams</hi> concluſion, who (it ſeemes) traded that way to doe miſchiefe (<hi>Numb:</hi> 23.23.) <hi>Surely there is no inchantment againſt Jacob, neither is there any divination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Iſrael: according to this time it ſhall be ſayd of Jacob, and of Iſrael, what hath God wrought?</hi> When God is reſolved to give a people quietneſſe, though the devill would, he cannot diſturbe them. We need not feare witches or magicians (who correſpond with hell to trouble the earth) if God ſay there ſhall be peace; neither policy, nor power, nor witchery, can prevaile againſt the purpoſe of God.</p>
                  <p>Then happy are that people, who <hi>have the Lord for their God (Pſal:</hi> 144.15.) what can a people deſire more to make them happy, then <hi>to have the Lord for their God,</hi> if we conſider theſe two things?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God hath a negative voyce upon all the counſells of the wiſeſt men in the world; if he ſaith it ſhall not be, it cannot be, whoſoever ſaith this or that ſhall be (<hi>Lam:</hi> 3.37.) <hi>Who is he that ſaith and it cometh to paſſe, when the Lord commandeth it not?</hi> if he gives not his aſſent, nothing can paſſe into a law. The Lords ſingle negative ſtops the affirmative votes of all men joyned in one.</p>
                  <pb n="737" facs="tcp:104248:379"/>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lords power is paramount; He can effect what he willeth, whether men will or no. That's plaine in the text. <hi>If he give quietneſſe, who can make trouble?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To come a little nearer; This day, this <hi>fifth of November,</hi> which we ſolemnize in a thankfull remembrance of our deliverance from the <hi>Gun-powder treaſon,</hi> is a very great confirmation of this truth.</p>
                  <p>Who is there that was alive at that day (as ſeverall here I know were) yea who is there that hath heard of that day, of the ſubſtance and circumſtances, of the matter and manner of the <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder treaſon,</hi> but can tell us, that a Popiſh party at home with their correſpondents abroad, intended to make trouble in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſurely there was a purpoſe to make trouble in the nation that day, if ever there were a purpoſe to make trouble in any nation. What did they leave unattempted, to promote the trouble of this nation? Counſels were joyned for a conjunction of forces to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this nation. The men ingaged in that plot, may properly be called <hi>Trouble-makers;</hi> It was their buſineſs or their deſigne to trouble the waters, that themſelves might fiſh in thoſe waters of trouble. We may with reſpect to their purpoſe, (though God prevented it graciouſly) truly ſay to them what <hi>Ahab</hi> ſayd falſly to <hi>Elijah, Theſe were the men that would have troubled our Iſrael;</hi> they would have made trouble in every way, and in every thing, wherein trouble could be made by men.</p>
                  <p>Would it not have made trouble to deſtroy the King the chiefe Governour of theſe three nations, with his royall iſſue in one day?</p>
                  <p>Would it not have made trouble, to blow up the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the nation, the Parliament, in one day?</p>
                  <p>Would it not have made trouble, to put the whole body of the people into a confuſed heape, without a head, in one day?</p>
                  <p>Would it not have made trouble in the nation, to have ſeene Papal power, with Popiſh Doctrine and worſhip brought in againe upon us within a few dayes?</p>
                  <p>Would it not have made trouble, to have ſeene poore ſoules impriſon'd, perſecuted, and conſumed to aſhes for their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious witneſs-bearing to the truths of the Goſpel?</p>
                  <p>Would it not have made trouble, to have loſt our civil liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to have had a yoke of ſpirituall Bondage layd upon our necks by worſe then <hi>Egyptian</hi> task-maſters?</p>

                  <p>Would it not have made trouble, to ſpill the blood of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands? Was it not an attempt to make trouble, to attempt all theſe things which would probably, that I ſay not certainly, have been the iſſue of that plot, if it had ſucceeded? Let us therefore praiſe the Lord, who was pleaſed to prevent it, and ſayd it ſhall not be. They did every thing to make trouble, but make trouble; they did every thing, but proſper in their deſigne: They took ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, they took oaths, yea they took the Sacrament to aſſure the ſecrecy of thoſe counſels and oaths. All this they did towards the making of trouble, yet they could not; God ſayd at that time let <hi>England</hi> be in quietneſs; and therefore, only, thoſe Romiſh Emiſſaries and incendiaries could not make trouble.</p>
                  <p>Againe, If we conſider the preſent ſeaſon wherein we live, 'tis a confirmation of this truth, God hath given us quietneſſe for ſome yeares; and hath he not preſerved this quietneſſe hitherto, againſt all thoſe both perſons and things that would have made trouble? if God had not confirmed our peace, we had been in trouble long before this time, but yet our peace continueth, yet it continueth; and is it not wonderfull that it ſhould continue, if we conſider.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The ſins of the nation which are the ſeed of trouble, eſpecially thoſe two generall ſins, firſt, unthankfullneſſe for our peace; Secondly, our ill improvement of it. How have many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed their peace to nurſe up their pride, wantonneſs and vaniy! and being delivered from the feare of men, have even caſt off the feare of God! what juſt cauſe is there, that we ſhould looſe that peace which we have uſed ſo ill, and have almoſt turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a warre with God himſelfe! yet hitherto the Lord hath given <hi>England</hi> quietneſs, and none could make trouble.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If we look upon the diviſions, both in opinion, and affection, that are found among us, is it not a wonder that yet we have peace! if God had not <hi>given quietneſſe,</hi> doubtleſſe theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, of which we are ſo ſadly full, had filled us with trouble long before this time.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, While we conſider the different intereſts which have been abetted and hotly purſued by too many in this nation, is it not marveilous in our eyes, that our peace is continued! divided intereſts make greateſt diſtances, &amp; open thoſe breaches through which trouble uſually enters upon a nation. When a people are of
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:104248:380"/> one mind, of one heart and way, trouble can ſcarce find any way to come in among them. But only God (who peremptorily gives quietneſſe) can give quietneſſe to and prevent the trouble of a people who are divided in opinions, affections, and Intereſts. As therefore it is the moſt deſireable mercy that a people may be all united as one man, in one mind, heart, and way, according to the mind, heart, and way of God; ſo it is a moſt admirable mercy, to ſee their peace continued while any conſiderable part among them are diſ-united in any of, eſpecially if in all theſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider, that ſince the time of our peace, we have had many changes, we have been emptied from veſſel to veſſel, from hand to hand, from government to government, and from governour to governour; and is it not matter of aſtoniſhment as wel as of thanks-giving, that yet we have quietneſs! how many have waited and hoped, yea deſired and longed for our day of trouble, by theſe changes, revolutions and viciſſitudes, but yet we have peace. Muſt we not then conclude, <hi>If God giveth quietneſſe, none can make trouble;</hi> neither our ſins, nor our diviſions, nor our animoſities, nor our changes ſhall put it into any mans power (though they put an advantage into many mens hands) to make trouble where the Lord our God is graciouſly &amp; freely pleaſed to give us quietneſs. Yet let us be in a holy feare, leſt we at laſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God, and ſin away our quietneſs, and make trouble for our ſelves. The condition of a people who doe ſo is very wofull; for ſurely (as it followeth in the text)
<q>If he hideth his face, who then can behold him?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This latter part of the verſe is applicable to a nation as well as the former, and therefore before I come to ſpeake of either with reſpect to a ſingle perſon, or <hi>a man only.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>God ſometimes hideth his face from whole nations, even from thoſe nations that have the outward profeſſion of his name.</q>
                  <p>As there are national mercies, ſo national calamities, as his people in common may have the ſhinings of Gods face upon them, ſo the hidings of his face from them. Did not God hide his face from the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his peculiar people, when they were though a profeſſing people, yet a very ſinfull &amp; provoking people?
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:104248:381"/> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2.) Is it not ſayd (<hi>Jer:</hi> 7.12.14, 15.) <hi>Goe ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I ſet my name at the firſt, and ſee what I did to it, for the wickedneſs of my people Iſrael;</hi> God would not alwayes owne that place which he ſignally called his <hi>owne,</hi> and had ſet his name there, and that, <hi>at firſt</hi> (which was a great endearement of it to him) but when they ſinned much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, he would not ſo much as give them a looke of favour, no nor of pitty, till they turned from their wickedneſſe; yea he made his ſevere proceeding with them a preſident to his people in another Generation, as it followeth in the ſame place. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I doe unto this houſe which is called by my name, wherein ye truſt, and unto the place which</hi> I <hi>gave to you, and to your fathers, as</hi> I <hi>have done to Shiloh. And I will caſt you out of my ſight, as I have caſt out all your brethren, even the whole ſeede of Ephraim.</hi> There's a nation caſt out of the ſight of God. To be caſt out of Gods ſight is more, if more can be, then Gods hiding his face from a people. The Church complained bitterly of this latter (<hi>Pſ:</hi> 44.24.) <hi>Wherefore hideſt thou thy face, and forgetteſt our affliction, and our oppreſſion.</hi> We uſe to ſay, <hi>Out of ſight, out of minde;</hi> and when God leaves a nation under affliction, as if he did not minde them nor cared what became of them, then the Scripture ſaith, <hi>he hideth his face from them,</hi> or, <hi>caſteth them out of his ſight.</hi> I ſhall only adde three things about this hiding of the face of God from a nation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This hiding of his face, is not a ſudden act of God, he doth not preſently nor eaſily hide his face from a people. He tells them often he will doe it, before he doth it once. The Lord warned the old world long, before he brought the flood (<hi>Gen:</hi> 6.3.) <hi>And the Lord ſayd, my ſpirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with man, for that he alſo is fleſh: yet his dayes</hi> (wherein I will ſpare him and wait for his repentance) <hi>ſhall be an hundred and twenty yeares.</hi> Of this patience the Apoſtle ſpake, telling us (1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 3.19, 20.) That Chriſt by the Spirit which quickned him, <hi>went and preached to the ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rits in priſon</hi> (not in priſon when he preached to them, but in priſon ever ſince for not obeying what he preached, as the text ſaith) <hi>which ſometime were diſobedient, when once the long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of God waited in the dayes of Noah, while the Arke was a preparing: wherein few, that is, eight ſoules were ſaved by water;</hi> God did not preſently hide his face from that debauched Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:104248:381"/> who had corrupted all their wayes, but gave them long warning, even an hundred and twenty years. And how often did God give warning before he withdrew or hid his face from the people of Iſrael, his ſpecial people? He ſent his Prophets ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing early, and ſending them, ſaying, <hi>Oh do not this abominable thing that I hate,</hi> (Jer. 44.4.) And in another place, <hi>O Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, be inſtructed, leſt my ſoul depart (or be disjoynted) from thee;</hi> (Jer. 6.8.) as if he had ſaid, I am loth to depart, yea I will not depart, if thou wilt but now at length hearken to my voice, and receive inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As God is long before he begins to hide his face from a Nation, ſo he doth it not all at once, but gradually, or by ſeveral ſteps: we read (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.3.) how <hi>the glory of the God of Iſrael was gone up from the Cherub whereupon he was, to the threſhold of the houſe:</hi> Then (<hi>chap.</hi> 10.18.) <hi>The glory of the Lord departed from off the threſhold of the houſe, and ſtood over the Cherubims:</hi> And then (<hi>chap.</hi> 11.23.) <hi>The glory of the Lord went up from the midſt of the City, and ſtood upon the Mountain, which is on the Eaſt ſide of the City.</hi> When the Lord was departing from them, he did it by degrees; he withdrew and hid himſelf by little and little, as in the Eclipſe of the Sun, whether partial or total, we obſerve the light gradually ſhut in and hidden from us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As God is long before he hideth his face, and long in hiding it from a Nation, ſo (which makes it dreadful) his face being once hid, continueth long hid from Nations. He doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn preſently to them, as he often doth to particular perſons. The Eclipſes of Divine favour abide long upon Nations and Churches. We commonly ſay, <hi>Great</hi> bodies move ſlowly; And God is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſlow in his motions both from and towards great bodies; as he doth not quickly remove from them, ſo he doth not quickly return to them. He ſtayeth long before he hideth his face, and he makes them ſtay long before he cauſeth his face to ſhine upon them again. When for the ſin of Iſrael God gave up both them and the Ark into the hands of the Philiſtines (though the Philiſtines vexed with the hand of God upon them, ſent it back ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet) it was long before it was fully ſetled among them, (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.2.) <hi>And it came to paſs while the Ark abode in Kirjath-jearim, that the time was long, for it was twenty years, and all the houſe of Iſrael lamented after the Lord.</hi> The Ark (which was a ſigne of
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:104248:382"/> Gods preſence with them) being removed, was not ſoon reſtor'd to its proper place; yea it was 20. years more after that, before it was ſet in its place by <hi>David,</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.17.) And whereas it is ſaid, that in thoſe firſt twenty years, <hi>they lamented after the Lord,</hi> this ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, that all thoſe years God was (comparatively to what he had ſomtimes been) but as a ſtranger in the land, leaving them under the cruel oppreſſions of the Philiſtines: nor did they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his favourable preſence, till they ſolemnly repented and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, putting away their ſtrange gods, and <hi>Aſhteroth,</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their hearts unto the Lord to ſerve him only, as <hi>Samuel</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them to do at the third verſe of that chapter. The Jewiſh Nation in after ages had ſad experience of this in the Babyloniſh captivity; when God hid his face from them, it was ſeventy years before he lookt upon them again: and ſince that Nation provoked him (by their rejection of the Goſpel) to lay them aſide, God hath hid his face from them above theſe ſixteen hundred years, and they are to this day a ſcattered unſetled people, and wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers among the Nations, having their hearts hardned, and their eyes ſhut againſt the light of the glorious Goſpel. And as the Jewes, ſo many Chriſtian Churches have for a long time felt the ſad effects of theſe Divine hidings and withdrawings. Thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven famous Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> mentioned in the ſecond and third chapters of the Revelation, <hi>Epheſus, Smyrna,</hi> &amp;c. have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this woful Eclipſe many hundred years; nor have thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Churches in <hi>Africa,</hi> where <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> once flouriſhed, recovered the preſence of the Lord to this day. Let the Nations and Churches abroad remember this, and tremble to provoke the Lord to ſuch departures and deſertions. God hath long hid his face from the Bohemian Churches, &amp; ſubjected them again to the Papal yoke; ſeveral parts of <hi>Germany</hi> are under the ſame hidings: the light is departed from them, and they are left in much darkneſs; their ſtate is very deplorable, and their former purity, both as to doctrines of faith, and practiſe of worſhip (as to humane help) irrecoverable. And ſhould not the dealings of God with them, awaken us in theſe Nations and Churches, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and conſider the wonderful patience of God in continuing our peace, notwithſtanding all our provocations, leſt at laſt he hide his face from us alſo, and then who can behold him? A throng of evils and miſchiefs will ſoon appear to us with open face, if once
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:104248:382"/> God hide his face. And it will not be unuſeful to inſtance a little in this place, what thoſe evils and miſchiefs are which throng and croud in upon Nations and Churches, when God hideth his face from them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When God hideth his face from a Nation, he layeth down his former care of them, and watchfulneſs over them, he takes little or no notice of their caſe and condition, of their troubles and ſtreights, (as was toucht in opening the Text) he regards not how it is with them, nor what becomes of them. Such apprehenſions the Prophet had in reference unto the people of Iſrael, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 14.8.) where he humbly expoſtulated with the Lord, <hi>Why art thou as a ſtranger in the land, &amp; as a wayfaring man that turneth aſide to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for a night;</hi> a ſtranger or a wayfaring man, intending to ſtay but a night in a place, thinks not himſelf concerned with the ſtate of that place; if he can but get a ſupper and a lodging for his money that night, he troubles himſelf no further: whether it be well or ill with the place, whether it be ſickneſs or health, if he can make ſhift for a night, he is ſatisfied. Thus the Prophet conceived the Lord e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as a ſtranger among his people, little minding what became of them, whether they did ſink or ſwim, whether it were peace or trouble, joy or ſorrow with them. And, further, he repreſents the Lord not only as a ſtranger, but as a man aſtoniſhed, not only as a man who cares not to help, but as a man who cannot. An aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed man, how mighty ſoever he is, hath no uſe of his might. He that can do little with his reaſon (that's the caſe of an aſtoniſh'd affrighted man) can do leſs with his hands. Now ſuch a one is God to his people (that is, he will do no more for them then ſuch a one) when once he hideth his face from them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When the Lord hideth his face from a Nation, he hath no regard to their prayers and ſupplications, no not to their faſts and humiliations; that ſpeaks ſadly. Prayer is <hi>our best ſtrength,</hi> it engageth the ſtrength of God; by prayer we have our reſort to God, and fetch all our help and ſuccour in a day of trouble from his All-ſufficiency. If once God ſay to a people, I will not hear nor anſwer your prayers, they are in a moſt forlorn condition. Thus God reſolved againſt the people of Iſrael, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 14.12.) <hi>When they faſt, I will not hear their cry:</hi> And as he would not regard their own prayers, ſo he forbade the Prophet to pray for them, (<hi>verſ.</hi> 12.) <hi>The Lord ſaid unto me, pray not for this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:104248:383"/> for their good;</hi> yea, he tells them, he would not regard the prayers and interceſſions of any others for them, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 15.1.) <hi>Though Moſes and Samuel ſtood before me,</hi> (that is, ſhould become Advocates in their behalf) <hi>yet my heart could not be towards this people,</hi> (that's a ſure and a dreadful prognoſtick of ruine, as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth) <hi>cast them out of my ſight, and let them go forth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When the Lord hides his face from a Nation, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth to give them counſel, or to direct their way. We need the counſel of God as much as his ſtrength; as we cannot do what we know unleſs he ſtrengthen us, ſo we know not what to do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he counſel us. And when ever God hideth his face from a people, he hideth counſel from a people. When God hid his face from <hi>Saul,</hi> who was in a publick capacity, and in a publick caſe, his war with the Philiſtines, O how he complained that he could get no counſel, (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.6.15.) <hi>The Lord anſwers me no more, neither by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim, nor by Thummim, nor by Prophet, nor by Dreams;</hi> as if he had ſaid, I cannot get a word of direction from God, what to do in this calamitous and intricate condition, wherein my ſelf and my Kingdome are plung'd, by reaſon of this Invaſion; I know not what to do, and God will not at all give me any intimation what to do, nor how to do, what is ſafeſt, or moſt conducing to my own ſafety and preſervation. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet brings in the Church lamenting this effect of Gods hiding his face, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.9.) <hi>We ſee not our tokens, there is not any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, nor any that can tell how long;</hi> as if they had ſaid, heretofore God was wont to give us ſignes and tokens, he would even work miracles for us, or he would ſend a Prophet to inſtruct and adviſe us what to do, we had thoſe who could tell us <hi>how long,</hi> that is, how long our troubles ſhould laſt, and when we ſhould have our expected end of them; but now we are in trouble, and no man can tell us how long, now we are left to the wide world, to ſhift for our ſelves as well as we can; the Lord will not adviſe us what to do, nor give us his minde what's beſt to be done, or how to proceed; thus deplorable was their condition upon the hiding of Gods face from them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, (which is yet worſe) when the Lord hides his face from a people, he doth not only with-hold his counſels, but gives them up to their own counſels, &amp; that is, to their own hearts luſts, (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 81.12.) <hi>Iſrael would none of me</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>they would not hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:104248:383"/> to my voice:</hi> What then? <hi>So I gave them up to their own hearts luſts, and they walked in their own counſels:</hi> and that was to give them up to a ſpirit of diviſion, to a ſpirit of diſcontent, to a ſpirit of envie and jealouſie, to a ſpirit of ambition, of ſelf-ſeeking and emulation, and ſo to a ſpirit of diſtraction and confuſion, and ſo to ruine and deſtruction: ſuch and no better is the iſſue, when God gives a people up to their own counſels; then they ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a very Chaos, and run themſelves into a ruinous heap. <hi>As good have no counſel from man, as none but man's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, When God hides his face from a Nation, he is ready to declare his diſpleaſure, and the ſoreſt teſtimonies of his fierce anger, formally, againſt them; God looks upon a ſinfully ſinning people as a burthen upon his heart; he is preſt, and even oppreſt with them, he loaths them, his ſtomack turns at the thought of them, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.24.) <hi>Ah! I will eaſe me</hi> (the Hebrew is, I will be comforted, or I will comfort my ſelf, that is, I will unburden my ſoul, and ſatisfie my ſelf by taking vengeance) <hi>of my adverſaries,</hi> that is, of my people who have rebelled againſt my command, and have been diſobedient to my word. Theſe the Lord counts no more as his children and friends, but as his enemies, and numbers them among his adverſaries; <hi>Ah,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will eaſe me of mine adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:</hi> I am grieved to do it, yet I muſt do it, I am reſolved to do it. As ſoon as the Lord had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he would receive no interceſſion for Iſrael, he adds, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 15.1.2.) <hi>Cast them out of my ſight, let them go forth, and it ſhall come to paſs, if they ſay unto thee, whither ſhall we go forth? then thou ſhalt ſay unto them, thus ſaith the Lord, ſuch as are for death, to death, and ſuch as are for the ſword, to the ſword; and ſuch as are for the famine, to the famine; ſuch as are for captivity, to captivity; I will cauſe them to be removed into all Kingdoms of the earth,</hi> (verſ. 4.) <hi>and as I will not pity them, ſo none ſhall,</hi> (verſ. 5.) All theſe tokens of diſpleaſure fall upon a people when once the Lord hides his face from them. Yea then the Lord himſelf will go forth againſt them as a <hi>fierce Lion, (Hoſ.</hi> 5.14, 15.) He was to Iſrael as <hi>a moth, and as rottenneſs,</hi> (verſ. 12.) that is, a ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, he would alſo be an open deſtruction to them <hi>as a Lion,</hi> yea as a <hi>Leopard by the way would he obſerve them,</hi> or lye in wait for them, <hi>and meet them as a Bear that is, bereaved of her whelps, and rent the very caul of their heart,</hi> (Hoſ. 13.7, 8.) The Lord
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:104248:384"/> God takes upon him the actings of the moſt ſavage beaſts in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, to ſhew how much he is provoked, when he ſeeth his people act like beaſts in unrighteouſneſs, filthineſs, cruelties, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſures; when men behave themſelves unlike men, <hi>God will not meet them</hi> (as he told Babylon he would not, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.3.) <hi>as a man,</hi> that is, either in the weakneſs of a man, or in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions of a man; but he will meet them either as a beaſt of prey, who hath no compaſſion, or as God in the fulneſs of his power, not drawing forth, but quite reſtraining his compaſſions. Yea, the ſpirit of God will ſtrive no more in wayes of mercy with ſuch a people, but <hi>turning their enemy</hi> (Iſa. 63.10.) will fight againſt them. He not only forbeareth to aſſiſt them againſt, &amp; deliver them from their enemies, but even aſſiſteth their enemies againſt them, or delivereth them up into their enemies hand.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, When God hideth himſelf from a people, he removes their ſpiritual enjoyments; he takes away his holy Ordinances, his Worſhip, the light and power of his Goſpel, or leaves them nothing but the ſhells and out-ſide forms of them; they ſhall be fed with husks, becauſe they have not improved ſweet kernels and wholſome food; they ſhall have long ſhaddows, but little true light or Sun-ſhine. Viſion ſhall ceaſe; God will take away his Miniſters and be gone, and then they are preſently over-run with errour and ſuperſtition upon one hand, or with ignorance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs on the other.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, He will ſpoil them alſo in their Civil enjoyments, he will take away good Magiſtrates, who are as a ſtaff and a ſtay, as a ſhield and a ſhelter to a Nation; he will break the ſtay and ſtaff of Government, as he threatned (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.1, 2.) and then (as it followeth <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.) <hi>The childe ſhall behave himſelf proudly againſt the ancient, and the baſe againſt the honourable;</hi> he will leave them to the corruption of Juſtice, Judgement ſhall <hi>be turned away back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and juſtice ſhall ſtand afar off, and then truth falleth in the ſtreets, and equity cannot enter, (Iſa.</hi> 59.14.) and after all this, what will he do with them? He will either leave them to the worſt of National evils, total Anarchy, or, <hi>he will give children to be their Princes, and babes ſhall rule over them.</hi> When God hid his face from the Jewiſh Nation, he broke their Government by taking away ten Tribes out of <hi>Rehoboams</hi> hand, and putting them under <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> and out of his hand they fell into the hand of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:104248:384"/> other wicked Princes, til at laſt they were carried into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity by the common enemy. Theſe &amp; the like are the woful effects of Gods hiding his face from a Nation; from all which we may well conclude with <hi>Elihu</hi> in the Text, who then can behold him? who can bear his wrathful preſence, when his face or favourable preſence is hidden from us? To ſhut up this point, I ſhall only adde, that becauſe theſe hidings of Gods face are gradual, (as was ſhewed before) therefore they are little taken notice of; as the Prophet complained (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.9.) <hi>Gray hairs are here and there upon them, and they know it not;</hi> that is, they are in a declining condition, (gray hairs are the ſignes of old age,<note place="margin">Eorum mihi videtur idone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ſenſus &amp; omnino Gorma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus qui hanc libertatem dei, ſive pacem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedendi ſive condemnandi (vel turbandi) ad tyrannos tantum coardat &amp; eos qui im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piè vivunt. <hi>Sanct.</hi>
                     </note> which is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion of mans life, he alludes from the body Natural, to the body Civil or Politick, they are I ſay, in a declining, weakning, ſpending condition) yet they lay it not to heart. And that's a ſore, if not the chiefeſt judgement of God upon a Nation, when hiding his face, he hides his judgements from them, and gives them up to hardneſs of heart, to blindneſs of minde, and a ſpirit of ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, that they ſee not nor take notice of their own danger, nor the departure of God from them, which is the cauſe of it. And ſtill the more God hideth his face from a Nation, the more miſerable they are, and withal, the more inſenſible of their miſery. So much from that conſideration of the Text, as to a Nation, <hi>When he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth quietneſs, who can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? Whether it be againſt a Nation,</hi>
                     <q>Or againſt a man only.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As this verſe reſpects a man only, or a ſingle perſon, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded two or three wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Of Oppreſſors and wicked men; as if he had ſaid, <hi>When God will give a wicked man quietneſs or proſperity in his ſinful way, who can make his eſtate troublous, or trouble him in his eſtate? He ſhall be quiet while the will of God is to ſuffer him to be ſo; and if God once hide his face from him,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Si deus pacem tribuat impiis, quis illius pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntiam &amp; arcana iudicia co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The words are expounded of the oppreſſed, or of godly men; as if he had ſaid, when God is minded or reſolved to give peace and quietneſs to any of his faithful ſervants, who can hinder him, or trouble them? and when he is pleaſed for reaſon
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:104248:385"/> beſt known to himſelf, to leave any of his faithful ſervants in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and withdraw the light of his countenance from them, who among them can behold him? that is, bear or endure his angry appearances.</p>

                     </note>A third expounds the former part of the verſe according to the ſecond Expoſition of the whole verſe concerning the oppreſſed or afflicted godly, <hi>if God will give them quietneſs, who can give them trouble?</hi> And the latter part of the verſe, of Oppreſſors, <hi>if he hideth his face from wicked and unjuſt men, who can behold him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, Some who take this ſence, do not underſtand it as an act of God hiding his own face, but as an act of God hiding the face of the wicked Oppreſſor; as if it had been ſaid, <hi>When God hideth a wicked mans face, and wraps him up as a condemned man,</hi> or when, by the command of the Magiſtrate, after his legal tryal his face is covered, being ready to ſeal the warrant for his execution; (<hi>Hamans</hi> face was covered as ſoon as the Kings word went out againſt him) then <hi>who can behold him?</hi> Some inſiſt much upon this interpretation, in alluſion to the cuſtome of thoſe times, when condemned malefactors had their faces covered; and indeed, when God wraps up the oppreſſors face as a condemned man, <hi>who can behold him,</hi> that is, who can hold up his face againſt God, or reſiſt him in this work of juſtice. But I intend not to proſecute the perſonal conſideration of the Text under theſe diſtinct noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but ſhall only take up the general ſence; <hi>When he giveth quietneſs to a man, who can make trouble? and when he hideth his face from a man, who can behold him?</hi> I ſhall only adde Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi>'s gloſs upon the whole verſe; <hi>when for the poor he kills the mighty, none can ſtay him; and when he hideth his favour, none can finde it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The quietneſs or peace of any man, of every man, is of the Lord.</q>
                  <p>If God will have a wicked man live in quietneſs, to it ſhall be, and God hath given, and doth often give them quietneſs. I <hi>have ſeen the wicked in great power, and ſpreading himſelf like a green Bay tree,</hi> (Pſal. 37.35.) <hi>David</hi> ſpake this from a good witneſs, the ſight of his eye: I (ſaith he) have ſeen the wicked in much
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:104248:385"/> outward pomp and ſplendour, and as the outward peace and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs, pomp and ſplendour of the wicked is from God, ſo alſo is both the outward and inward peace of any godly man.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The outward peace, or the peace of a godly man in his outward eſtate, is of the Lord, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.8.) <hi>I will both lay me down in peace and ſleep, for thou only makeſt me to dwell in ſafety:</hi> that is, thou O Lord wilt watch over me in the night, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to be ſurprized by any ſudden danger, and therefore I will quietly repoſe my ſelf upon thy gracious promiſes, and throw off thoſe cares and fears, which as thorns in the pillow, would not ſuffer me to reſt, when I lye down in my bed: the Lord is my ſafety, even the reſt of my body. In the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter of this book (<hi>ver.</hi> 23, 24.) <hi>Eliphaz</hi> telleth us, how the Lord ſecures the outward condition of a good man, and gives him ſuch quietneſs, that even <hi>the very beaſts of the earth ſhall be in league, and the ſtones of the field at peace with him, and he ſhall know</hi> (or be aſſured) <hi>that his tabernacle ſhall be in peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The inward peace, the ſoul peace, the ſpiritual peace of a godly man is much more from the Lord, (<hi>John</hi> 14.27.) <hi>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth, ſo give I unto you;</hi> as if Chriſt had ſaid, I will not deal with you after the rate of the world, that is, either deceitfully and falſly, or rigorouſly and unjuſtly; I will not give you ſuch meaſure as the world gives you, nor in ſuch a manner; <hi>I give you my peace,</hi> therefore <hi>let not your hearts be troubled, neither be you afraid:</hi> what-ever outward trouble the world can give you, be not afraid of it before it cometh, nor troubled at it when 'tis come, I will give you inward peace in the midſt of all your troubles. Chriſt invites the weary and the heavie laden to come to him, with this promiſe, <hi>I will give you reſt,</hi> (Matth. 11.29.) ſoul-reſt he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; that Title or name of Chriſt, <hi>Shiloh,</hi> (Gen. 49.10. <hi>The Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall not depart from Judah, until Shiloh come</hi>) ſignifies tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, peace, and reſt; As Jeſus Chriſt hath bought our peace and reſt with his blood, ſo he bears it in his name. The fountain of our ſoul-peace is the heart of the father, <hi>Grace and Peace from God the Father,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Col.</hi> 1.1, 2. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.1.) The purchaſe or price of this peace, is the blood of the Son, (<hi>Col.</hi> 1.22.) <hi>He hath made our peace through the blood of his Croſs:</hi> Our peace coſt dear, it coſt blood, and that the blood of the Son of God. The
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:104248:386"/> conveyance of this peace is made by the holy Spirit; he is ſent to bring the good tydings of peace unto believers: the Spirit ſpeaks peace from God, and witneſſeth with our ſpirits, that we are at peace with God. And as this peace is at firſt from God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the fountain of it, &amp; from God the Son as the Purchaſer of it, and from God the holy Ghoſt as the Speaker of it; ſo the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing and renewing of this peace is from the ſame God. He eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth and ſetleth the heart in that peace which he hath given, and he reſtoreth that peace when at any time we have loſt it, and the heart is unſetled. <hi>David's</hi> ſoul being unquiet, and his peace ravell'd after his ſin, he addreſſed to God for the renewing of it, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12.) <hi>Reſtore to me the joy of thy ſalvation. David</hi> peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the reſtoring of his peace, while he petitioned the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his joy: 'tis poſſible to have peace without joy, but there can be no joy in that ſoul, which hath not firſt attained to peace. We muſt wait upon God both for the reſtoring of our peace when it is departed, and for the continuance of it when it is enjoyed. <hi>When he giveth quietneſs</hi> to a man, either as to ſoul, or body, or both,
<q>Who can make trouble?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, Secondly.</p>
                  <q>The quietneſs or peace which God beſtows upon any perſon is an invincible, an inſuperable peace and quietneſs, as to all that this world can do, or he ſuffer in this world.</q>
                  <p>If God will give a quiet outward eſtate, no man can diſturb it; when God gave <hi>Job</hi> outward quietneſs, what a mighty man was he? how did he flouriſh? Nor could any break his outward peace; Satan confeſt it in the firſt chapter, <hi>Thou haſt made a hedge about him, and about his houſe, and about all that he hath, on every ſide;</hi> there is not the leaſt gap open, no nor ſtake looſned in his hedge, who can touch him? who can come at him? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not touch him, Sabeans and Chaldeans cannot touch him. While the Lord giveth and guardeth our outward peace, it is inviolable. And as to our ſpiritual peace, if the Lord ſpeak it, who or what can trouble the ſoul?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The afflictions, tribulations, and vexations which we meet with in the world, cannot trouble this inward peace; while ſtorms are without, there will be a calm within; the ſoul may be at peace,
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:104248:386"/> and the conſcience quiet, in the greateſt viſible confuſions. Let the world turn about and overturn, let it ſhake and break into a thouſand pieces, this peace abides unſhaken, unbroken: let the world rage in the heat either of war or perſecution, yet the heart is ſerene, fixt, and quiet, like Mount Zion, that cannot be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Chriſt tells his Diſciples (<hi>John</hi> 16.33.) <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace;</hi> (and in the ſame verſe he foretells them) <hi>In the world you ſhall have tribulation:</hi> as if he had ſaid, you ſhall have a peace concurrent and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary with your tribulation; trouble from the world ſhall not hinder the peace you have from me; yea, my peace ſhall conquer the troubles you have in the world. Thus the Prophet tryum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed in believing, (<hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17.) <hi>Though the labour of the Olive ſhould fail, and the Vine yeild no fruit, though there be no Calves in the ſtall, nor Sheep in the fold,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet I will joy in the Lord, and rejoyce in the God of my ſalvation.</hi> To rejoyce in the Lord, is more then to be quiet, or to have peace in the Lord. <hi>Joy is the exalta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of peace, it is the moſt delicious fruit of peace:</hi> The worſt of worldly evils cannot deſpoil us of the leaſt purely ſpiritual good, much leſs of the greateſt. <hi>Him wilt thou keep in perfect peace, whoſe minde is ſtayed on thee,</hi> (Iſa. 26.3.) That's perfectly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to which nothing can be added, and from which nothing can be taken away; yet that is truly perfect, to which though ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be added, yet it cannot be either totally or finally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. Such is the ſoul-peace of true believers in this life, and therefore a perfect peace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As outward tribulation cannot hinder the ſoul-peace of a godly man, ſo the policy, plots, and temptations of Satan our arch-enemy cannot, yea his charges and moſt ſpiteful accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall not. The great deſigne of the devil, is, to deſtroy and devour ſouls, his own condition being moſt miſerable, he at once envies all thoſe who are not in the ſame condition, and attempts to make them ſo; and when he fails in that attempt, the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſouls, yet he will not ceaſe to attempt their moleſtation, and to trouble thoſe whom he cannot utterly devour. Now, as Satan cannot at all prevail in the former attempt, the deſtroying of ſouls, ſo he cannot wholly prevail in the latter, the troubling of ſouls. Hence that gallant challenge of the Apoſtle, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34.) <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? it
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:104248:387"/> is God that juſtifieth: who is he that condemneth, it is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather, that is riſen again,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, let all the enemies of our ſpiritual peace riſe up and combine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they ſhall not be able to condemn, that is, wholly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage or diſquiet the heart of a believer, he having received (his <hi>quietus eſt</hi>) reſt and peace from God, in the juſtification of his perſon, and the pardon of his ſins. Satan can do much, and would do more (if his chain were lengthned, and he not reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) to the trouble and moleſtation of our ſouls, there's not a godly man living ſhould reſt an hour in quiet for him, if he might have his wiſh or his will; but becauſe God gives quietneſs to ſome believers, and will not have it ſo much as ſtirr'd, therefore Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan cannot make any trouble at all in their ſouls, but they live in the conſtant light of God's countenance, and in the joy of the holy Ghoſt. And becauſe the quietneſs which every believer hath is the gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt, who hath made their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, and eſtabliſhed their peace, through the blood of his Croſs, therefore Satan cannot make any ſuch trouble in any of their ſouls, as ſhall for ever deſtroy their peace, or diſſolve their quietneſs, though for many reaſons, all ſerving his glory, and their good, God ſuffereth ſatan many times, poſſibly for a long time to entangle and interrupt it. Temptations to the committing of ſin, and accuſations or charges about ſin committed, may exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly hinder and ſhake the peace of a believer; but, as the ſins to which he is tempted cannot hurt his peace, when he reſiſts and overcomes them, ſo the ſins into which he falleth through tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, cannot deſtroy his peace, becauſe thoſe ſins ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be deſtroyed both by repentance and pardon.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The thunders of the Law cannot take away the peace of that ſoule, to whom God giveth quietneſs. Chriſt having in his owne perſon fullfilled the Law for beleevers, both doing the duty, and enduring the penalty of it, he hath delivered them from the terror and curſe of the Law, himſelfe having been made a curſe for them (<hi>Gal:</hi> 3.13.) So then if neither tribulations nor temptations, nor the terrors of the Law can make trouble, where God giveth quietneſs; we may conclude, nothing can.</p>
                  <p>There is a double Conſideration upon both which, we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that if God giveth quietneſs, either outward or inward, none can make trouble.</p>
                  <pb n="753" facs="tcp:104248:387"/>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe, as God is ſoveraigne and ſo may diſpoſe peace and quietneſs, to whom he pleaſeth, or at his pleaſure, when he will, or to whom he will; ſo he hath an all-ſufficiency to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and confirme, to preſerve and protect the outward peace of any man, againſt all the powers of this world; and the inward peace of a godly man againſt all the powers of hell, againſt the terrors of the Law, and the accuſations whether of Satan or of his owne Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, None can deſtroy the peace of a godly man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a perfect peace, as was ſhewed before from that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the Prophet (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 26.3.) <hi>Him wilt thou keepe in perfect peace whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee.</hi> For, being a perfect peace it will not decay of it ſelfe; and becauſe 'tis perfect God will neither deſtroy it himſelfe, nor ſuffer any elſe to deſtroy it. <hi>Marke the perfect man</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal: 37.37.) <hi>and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.</hi> He is a perfect man whoſe end is peace, and that is perfect peace which holds to the end, or which ſhall never end. The peace which God giveth is perfect; Firſt, becauſe 'tis eſtabliſhed upon perfect righteouſneſſe, <hi>the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God.</hi> That righteouſneſſe which is the roote of our peace is called the righteouſneſſe of God, both becauſe God hath appoynted it, and becauſe God hath wrought it. Jeſus Chriſt <hi>God-man</hi> is the Lord our righteouſneſſe, and the Prince of our peace; or as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it (<hi>Heb:</hi> 7.1, 2.) <hi>He is Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec, being by interpretation King of righteouſneſſe, and after that alſo King of Salem, which is King of peace.</hi> (Iſa. 32.17.) <hi>The work of righteouſneſſe is peace, and the fruit of it is quietneſſe and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance for ever.</hi> Righteouſneſſe is ſuch a foundation of peace, as cannot be ſhaken, and therefore that peace which is built upon it cannot be utterly overthrowne, how much ſoever it may be ſhaken.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, 'Tis a perfect peace, becauſe it was obtained by an abſolute victory over all the enemies of it. That people muſt needs be in perfect peace who have got a perfect conqueſt over all their enemies, and have got their oppoſers under their feet. Now the ſpirituall peace which God giveth his people, ariſeth from a perfect conqueſt over all their enemies. Firſt, the world is perfectly conquered by Chriſt (<hi>John</hi> 16.33.) <hi>Be of good cheare, I have overcome the world.</hi> Secondly, the Devill is perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:104248:388"/> by Chriſt (<hi>Heb:</hi> 2.14.) <hi>He hath deſtroyed him that had the power of death, that is, the Devill.</hi> He is more then conquered who is deſtroyed; Chriſt hath deſtroyed the Devill, who is the deſtroyer, though not as to his being, though not as to his will to deſtroy, yet as to his power to deſtroy thoſe whom he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, and will eternally ſave. Thirdly, Chriſt hath alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conquered the Law (not by deſtroying but) by fullfilling it. Chriſt was above all that the Law, required or commanded, and ſo he did at once freely ſubmit to it, and fully (as to any hindrance of a believers peace) ſubdue it, he holdeth it under him as well as he was made under it. And he was contented for that very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be made under the Law, that he might hold it under him, and that we might not be under (the dread of) the Law (though we muſt walke and worke by the rule of it) but under grace.</p>
                  <p>'Tis matter of ſtrong conſolation to poore ſoules, that when the Lord <hi>giveth quietneſs none can make trouble.</hi> And hence we alſo learne, that all the breaches which are made upon the peace of the people of God, are from God himſelfe. As thoſe breaches are meritoriouſly from themſelves, ſo efficiently from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; till he breaks their peace none can.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From the ſecond branch, <hi>When he hideth his face, who then can behold him?</hi> This being applicable to a ſingle perſon as well as the former.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>God ſometimes clouds his face from his owne ſervants, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</q>
                  <p>Theſe words, <hi>When he hideth his face,</hi> ſuppoſe that God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doth ſo, and the Scripture elſe-where teſtifies that God hath often done ſo; <hi>God hath love alwayes in his heart towards his children, but he hath not alwayes favour in his face towards them;</hi> his appearances are not alwayes the appearances of a friend, he may appeare angry, and turne away his face as if he would not be ſpoken with. Of this we find frequent complaints in Scripture; and I might ſpeake much to this poynt, but I have already met with it (<hi>Chap:</hi> 13.24.) and therefore I paſſe from it.</p>
                  <p>Only from the connexion of theſe words, <hi>When he hideth his face, who can behold him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="755" facs="tcp:104248:388"/>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>The hiding of Gods face, or the vayling of his favour is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grievous unto any perſon.</q>
                  <p>When he doth it, <hi>who can behold him?</hi> This manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth not only hold out, that if God will hide his face no man can ſee him, or know him; for God is a ſecret to all men untill he is pleaſed to reveale himſelfe; yea all the truths of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are ſecrets, and myſteries, till God is pleaſed to reveale them and make them knowne (<hi>Math:</hi> 11.25.) <hi>Father I thank thee</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and haſt revealed them unto babes;</hi> that is, thou haſt not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened them to the wiſeſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (there needs no other hiding of them from the wiſeſt of men, than a forbearance to open them) but to the babes, who are (though weake, yet) humble and teachable, thou haſt opened them, and opened their eyes and hearts to ſee and receive them. This ſpeech holds out not only this truth, that when God doth not reveale himſelfe, no man can know him or any thing of his minde, or that neither his nature, or his will are knowne but by ſome way of revelation; but this forme of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>(Who can behold him?)</hi> plainly tells us, that if God hideth his favour, he is ſo terrible, that none can have the boldneſs or cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to behold him. For the hiding of his face, implyeth an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of anger and diſpleaſure; and when he is angry, who can behold him? <hi>If the children of Iſrael could not ſtedfaſtly behold the face of Moſes for the glory of his countenance,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeakes (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 3.7.) ſurely then no man can ſtedfaſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the face of God when his countenance is filled with wrath.

Now, on the other ſide, if the Father will not ſhew himſelfe, if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will hide himſelfe from the ſoule, what then can ſuffice? what can comfort? where is our refuge or reſt?<note place="margin">Tranquillus deus tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat omnia.</note> 
                     <hi>As when God is quiet and favourable to us, he can make all things favourable and quiet to us;</hi> So, if God be diſpleaſed, nothing can be pleaſing to a ſoule that is ſenſible of his diſpleaſure. A believer looſes not
<pb n="756" facs="tcp:104248:389"/> only the joy and triumph of his faith, but his very peace, he is not only in a dark, but in a diſturb'd condition, not knowing where to repoſe himſelfe, or reſt his head, when God hideth his face.</p>
                  <p>Take this inference from it.</p>
                  <q>If the hiding of Gods face be ſo terrible, then take heed of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking him to hide his face.</q>
                  <p>For though we are not tenants at will for our peace in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto the world, in reference to men, in reference to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills; yet we are only tenants at will for our peace in reference unto God. He can take away our peace; and he doth uſually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue our peace, only ſo long as we behave our ſelves well. As ſome have <hi>Letters Patents</hi> for great offices which run in that tenour; <hi>They ſhall enjoy them</hi> (quam diu ſe bene geſſerint) <hi>as long as they carry themſelves well;</hi> but upon default or male-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration they may be turned out of all; ſo I ſay, though we are not at the will of the world, nor of any creature, for the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our peace, yet we are at the will of God for it. And as he ſometimes meerly out of prerogative hideth his face (as was ſhewed <hi>Job</hi> 13.24.) that he may try what a ſoule will doe in a dark condition, and that he may declare what the ſtrength of his inviſible grace can doe when nothing is viſible, no not any the leaſt ray or ſhine of favour from himſelfe to ſupport and comfort the ſoule, I ſay, though God doth thus in a prerogative way ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hide his face) yet uſually he doth it not, but upon ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault in us, eſpecially our neglect of him; when we regard not the face of God, and grow ſlight as to our valuations of his preſence, then he withdraweth his preſence and vayles his face towards us; and when we fall into any groſſe ſin (ſuch was the caſe of <hi>David, Pſal:</hi> 51.) God takes us upon default, and leaves us in a ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as he did <hi>David,</hi> who complained that even his bones were broken, and that he had loſt the joy of his ſalvation, which upon the renewing of his faith and repentance, he begg'd earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might be reſtored to him, and it was. Therefore <hi>if you would keepe the light of Gods Countenance, keepe cloſe to the light of Gods Commandement.</hi> No marvaile if we be under the hidings of the face of God, when we are turning our backes u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="757" facs="tcp:104248:389"/> wonder if God turne his face from ſinners? To turne our backe upon God is the worſt of a ſinfull condition, and to find God turning his backe upon us, or hiding his face from us, is the worſt of a miſerable condition. What can comfort us, when the God of all conſolation will not look upon us, unleſſe in diſpleaſure? What pleaſure (but the pleaſure of ſin for a ſeaſon, which ends, without repentance, in endleſſe torment, what pleaſure, I ſay) can that ſoule take in whom God taketh no pleaſure, or with whom he is not pleaſed? It is very ſad with the ſoule, when we looſe the ſight of our owne graces (ſometimes a gracious heart cannot ſee any worke of grace, nor perceive any workings of grace in him, but thinks he hath no faith in God, no love to God, no ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſin, this is ſad) but it is much more ſad to looſe the ſight of the face of God, to have the favour of God withdrawne from us. This made <hi>Jonah</hi> complaine (<hi>Chap:</hi> 2.4.) <hi>I am caſt out of the ſight of thine eyes;</hi> he lookt upon himſelfe as an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt, and then <hi>Jonah</hi> thought himſelfe as caſt into the belly of hell (<hi>v.</hi> 2.) When God hides his face from us, or will not vouchſafe us a ſight of his pleaſed face, we are as in the belly of hell, as <hi>Jonah</hi> bemoaned himſelfe. What is the glory and happineſſe of heaven? Is it not the ſight of the face of God? is it not the cleare viſion and manifeſtation of God? Glory is that eſtate wherein God will never once hide his face, nor look off from his glorified Saints, no not one moment to all eternity. Now the happineſſe which we have here, the heaven which we have upon earth conſiſts in this alſo; when we live neere God by believing, and behold his face by faith; when God lifts up the light of his countenance upon us, we are (as it were) lifted up from earth to heaven. <hi>As viſion in heaven will make us happy for ever, ſo hidings on earth make us mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable for the time.</hi> And that which is the very hell of a godly man upon earth, the worſt hell, he can or ſhall have, is this, when God hideth his face from him; Therefore take heed you doe not put the Lord upon withdrawing from you through your default; This favour, the ſhine or light of Gods face is continued or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to us, uſually upon theſe termes, as we behave our ſelves well or ill towards him.</p>

                  <p>Againe, There are hypocrites of two makes or ſtraines;
<pb n="759" facs="tcp:104248:390"/> Firſt, Religious, or Church hypocrites. Secondly, State, or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil hypocrites, and ſomtimes theſe two are combined in one. 'Tis poſſible for a man who pretends not to Religion, yet to be a hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite; A Magiſtrate, whether ſupream or ſubordinate, may offer very fair for the profit and liberty of the people whom he govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, when he mindes no ſuch thing; yea, he may not only offer fair for the good of a people, as to their outward profits and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, but as to the good of Religion, and the benefit of their ſouls, and yet minde no ſuch thing; we may take the hypocrite in this Text, as twiſted up, or compounded of both theſe; <hi>The State hypocrite and the Religious are ſomtimes bound up together.

                  <p>Secondly, This <hi>not reigning</hi> may be taken for a ſtop to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of his power, when he hath both attempted and attained it; and that two wayes, either firſt by taking him away from his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; or ſecondly, by taking away his power from him; as <hi>Daniel</hi> told <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> while he minded him of the greatneſs of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> (who had all the world (upon the matter) at his command) as alſo of his fall from that greatneſs, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 5.19, 20.) <hi>Whom he would, he ſet up; and whom he would, he put down; but when his heart was lifted up, and his minde hardned in pride, he was depoſed from his Kingly Throne, and they took his glory from him:</hi> He was depoſed, or as the Chaldee hath it, (ſo we
<pb n="760" facs="tcp:104248:391"/> put in the margin) <hi>He was made to come down from his Princely throne;</hi> either of theſe wayes doth God (who is <hi>the King of kings, and Lord of lords</hi>) when he pleaſeth, put a ſtop to, or check the progreſs of falſe hearted Princes, that have either got their power by flatteries and pretenſions to that good which they intended not, or who exerciſe their power ſo. <hi>That the hypocrite reigne not,</hi>
                     <q>Leſt the people be enſnared.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The root of the word here rendred <hi>to enſnare,</hi> ſignifieth the ſpreading of a Net, or the ſetting of a Grin, ſuch as Fowlers and Hunters make uſe of, to take Beaſts or Birds with; and thus God himſelf ſpake concerning his dealing with Babylon, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 50.24.) <hi>I have laid a ſnare for thee, and thou art alſo taken, O Babylon, and thou waſt not aware;</hi> litteral Babylon was a ſnare to the people of God of old, and ſo is myſtical Babylon at this day. <hi>The great Hypocrite, or Snare-ſetter, reigns in or over Babylon;</hi> therefore ſaith God, thou who haſt ſet ſnares for my people, ſhall be enſnared, thou ſhalt be taken unawares, I have ſet a ſnare to catch and hold thee faſt. When <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>leſt the people be enſnared,</hi> it ſeems to intimate, that God will prevent the enſnaring of a people by the hypocrite; He ſhall not reigne, <hi>leſt the people be enſnared,</hi> or leſt they ſhould come into ſnares. There is another reading, which gives the reaſon from the ſnares which the people have already been entangled with, <hi>becauſe of the ſnare,</hi> or <hi>becauſe the people have been enſnared,</hi> (therefore ſaith the Lord) <hi>let not the hypocrite reigne;</hi> thus God revengeth the peoples wrong, and doth juſtice upon thoſe that had ſet ſnares for them. So much for the general ſence of theſe words, and the opening of them.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſecond reading of the whole verſe, which carryeth the ſence ſomwhat another way, and yet may be of uſe, and yeild us ſome profitable conſiderations, but I ſhall not meddle with that, till I have proſecuted thoſe obſervations which ariſe clearly from our own reading.</p>
                  <p>The words in general hold forth the heart of God towards falſe hearted men, he cannot abide them, nor will he ſuffer them long to abide, eſpecially not to abide in power and greatneſſe; <hi>That the hypocrite reigne not, leſt the people be enſnared.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="761" facs="tcp:104248:391"/>
                  <p>Hence Note. Firſt,
<q>A hypocrite is a perſon hated of God, and hurtful to men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is therefore hated of God, becauſe hurtful to men. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is not pleaſed he ſhould reign, either as to reign is taken ſtrictly, for the exerciſing of Soveraign power; or, as to reign may be taken largely, for the exerciſing of any power, and living in the height of proſperity. For the clearing of this truth, that a hypocrite is hated of God, I ſhall ſhew, firſt the nature of an hypocrite; ſecondly, give the diſtinctions of hypocrites; thirdly, make ſome diſcoveries who is an hypocrite. To the</p>
                  <p>Firſt, An hypocrite in his general ſtate or nature, <hi>is</hi> (as I may ſay) <hi>a wicked man in a godly mans clothes;</hi> he hath an appearance of holineſs, when there's nothing but wickedneſs at the bottome. There are two great parts of the hypocrites work, firſt, to ſhew himſelf good, which he is not; this is properly the work of ſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or feigning: ſecondly, to cover that real evil which he is or doth: this is properly the work of diſſimulation or cloaking. The hypocrite ſtrives as much to appear what he is not, as not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear what he is; he makes a ſemblance of that purity which he loves not, and he diſſembleth that impurity which he loves and lives in.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may conſider hypocrites under this diſtinction. Firſt, there is <hi>a ſimple hypocrite,</hi> who hath not the good which he thinks and believes he hath; thus every one that profeſſeth or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the name of Chriſt, and is not really converted, is an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite; becauſe he hath not that which he ſeems to have, yea, which poſſibly he verily believes he hath; I may call ſuch a one (though it may ſeem a very ſtrange expreſſion) <hi>a ſincere hypocrite;</hi> he doth not intend to deceive others, but is deceived himſelf, becauſe he hath not the root of the matter in him, nor the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of godlineſs, though he brings forth ſome ſeeming fruits of godlineſs, and is much in the form of it. Such we may conceive ſhaddowed out to us by the fooliſh Virgins; they made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, they had their lamps, yea, they had oyl in their lamps, they did ſomwhat which was conſiderable in the outward duties of Chriſtian Religion, and they hoped to be accepted with Chriſt, but they had <hi>no oyl in their veſſels with their lamps, as the wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins had,</hi> (Matth. 25.4.) that is, they had no grace in their hearts,
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:104248:392"/> nor did they minde the getting of that till it was too late, (<hi>v.</hi> 10.) but ſatisfied themſelves with that little oyle in their lamps to make the blaze of an external profeſſion. Such as theſe are ſimple hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, being pleaſed with a ſhell inſtead of a kernel, and with a ſhaddow, neglecting the ſubſtance. Theſe hypocrites are in a very deplorable condition; yet theſe are not the hypocrites which I intend in this point, or have here to do with.</p>
                  <p>There are a ſecond ſort of hypocrites, commonly called <hi>groſs hypocrites,</hi> ſuch as hold that out which they know they have not, ſuch as know they have nothing in or of Religion, but the ſhew of it; ſuch as work by art, or with a kinde of force upon themſelves in all the good they do, and duties they perform towards God, and about the things of God. They do nothing as the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Timothy</hi> did (<hi>Phil.</hi> 2.20.) <hi>naturally, I have no man like-minded, who will naturally care for your ſtate.</hi> The word <hi>naturally</hi> is not there oppoſed to <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> but to artificially, or to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedly. What a ſincere heart doth in the things of God, he doth it naturally, that is, it floweth from an inward principle, it is not forced from him, but the hypocrite doth all as it were by a kinde of art or force upon himſelf. The Lord chargeth the Jews with this kinde of hypocriſie, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.2.) <hi>They ſeek me daylie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to know my wayes, as a Nation that did righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, they acted with an appearing forwardneſs, like thoſe who truly delight to know my wayes; yet all this was but as a piece of art, for as the Lord upbraided them (<hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4.) they really kept their ſins, and walkt in their own wayes of oppreſſion, ſtrife, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; yea they made all that noiſe abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t humbling themſelves, that they might the more undiſcernedly <hi>ſmite others with the fist of wickedneſs:</hi> and therefore ſaith the Lord (<hi>v.</hi> 5.) <hi>Is it ſuch a faſt that I have choſen, a day for a man to afflict his ſoul,</hi> &amp;c. and then for many dayes to afflict both the ſouls and bodies of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? or to abſtain a day from meat, and glut himſelf with ſin? That's the ſtrain of the hypocrite, he (as I may ſay) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and drives two trades, he hath a trade for God, and the wayes of God, and he hath a trade for ſin, and the wayes of wickedneſs; this is his courſe, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 12.2.) <hi>Thou art neer in their mouth, but far from their reins;</hi> they ſpeak of thee, but they have no deſires to thee, no affections for thee, thou art far enough from their reins; they act a part in Religion, but they neither par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of Religion, nor with it.</p>
                  <pb n="763" facs="tcp:104248:392"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, There are others, who beſides that they are groſs hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, may alſo be called <hi>deſigning or plotting hypocrites;</hi> for they that ſerve God <hi>with a reſerve,</hi> as to any ſin or by-way, uſually ſerve him with a deſigne, or for an end of their own. Chriſt (<hi>Matth.</hi> 23.14) ſpeaking of groſs hypocrites, ſuch as the Phariſees were, ſaith, <hi>they devour widdows houſes, and in a pretence make long pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> they pray long in a pretence, or under a pretence; that is, they have a plot or a deſigne in prayer, they pray, not purely to enjoy communion with God, nor purely to honour God; but they make uſe of prayer, and under pretence of that, do other work. Chriſt doth not there ſpeak againſt, nor diſparage long prayers, as ſome do, to the great reproach of the Spirit and grace of God, but he chargeth them with praying long in <hi>a pretence:</hi> pray heartily, and then pray as long as you will; other due cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances being obſerved, the more you pray, the more is God pleaſed. But whether prayers are long or ſhort, if done in a pretence, or with a deſigne to do miſchief to others, or only to get ſome worldly profit and advantage to our ſelves (as thoſe Phariſees prayed) they are an abomination to the Lord. <hi>'Tis not the length of prayer, but the end of prayer which diſcovers hypocriſie.</hi> The prophet <hi>Iſaiah (chap.</hi> 32.6.) gives us a deſcription of this groſs deſigning hypocrite, <hi>The vile perſon will ſpeak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practice hypocriſie, and to utter errour before the Lord:</hi> while the hypocrites heart worketh iniquity, his tongue ſpeaks villany; not that all his words are villanous words, for then he were not an hypocrite, but a profeſt prophane perſon; but he is ſaid to <hi>ſpeak villany,</hi> becauſe how pious, and ſpecious, and godly ſoever his diſcourſe is, yet he hath a villanous intent in ſpeaking, and his heart at the ſame time is working iniquity, to practice hypocriſie.</p>
                  <p>Now that I may a little more unmask this plotting hypocrite, I will ſhew you a fourfold plot or deſigne, which ſuch hypocrites have in their moſt zealous profeſſions of, and pretendings to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They deſigne their own praiſe or eſtimation among men; Chriſt makes this diſcovery in his Sermon upon the Mount, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 6.2.5.) <hi>Do not as the hypocrites, for all they do,</hi> (whether they give almes, or pray, or faſt,) is not for the glory of God, but that they may have glory of men, and be pointed at for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:104248:393"/> and holy perſons; <hi>Praiſe or glory with men is the food of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie.</hi> If the hypocrite have but an applauſe from, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with men, he doth not look after acceptance with God, which above all things a ſincere heart looketh after, and laboureth for; <hi>In this we labour</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9.) <hi>that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſent or abſent, we may be accepted of him;</hi> that's the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ambition of a ſincere heart: but the hypocrites ambition is to be accepted of, and to have praiſe among men; and therefore hypocrites are more troubled, if at any time they fail in expreſſing themſelves to men, then becauſe (which they do at all times) they fail and faulter in their affections to God; whereas he that is ſincere and honeſt with God, can bear it well enough though he hath not ſuch plauſible expreſſions towards men, becauſe he knoweth his affections ſtand right with God. That great Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian <hi>Alexander</hi> having run many hazards in war, turned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his ſouldiers, and ſaid, <hi>What pains have I taken, what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers have I under gone, only to be praiſed and cryed up by you?</hi> As many in their worldly actings aime only at their own praiſe, ſo do this ſort of hypocrites in their ſpiritual and holy actings; they pray, and hear, and deal about their almes for applauſe with men. What the Hiſtoſian writes of the Camelion, is moſt true of them, they live by the ayre, and are fed with the vapours of an earthly praiſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others (moſt of all the mighty, of whom <hi>Elihu</hi> is diſcourſing) act for God in the out-ſide of Religion, to get an opportunity of revenge upon men; they put on a fair ſhew of godlineſs, that they may have a fairer advantage to let out their malice, and vent their ſpleen. When either a real or ſuppoſed injury, falls upon an impotent and impatient ſpirit; malice will provoke to give that back which charity teacheth to forgive. The tyrannie of this paſſion gives no reſt to the diſcontented ſoul; all methods ſhall be ſtudied, and ſtratagems deviſed to content ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by the compaſſing of revenge; and when common projects fail, the habit of zeal and religion ſhall be put on, that the concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved malice may be let out: Such a man will cloath himſelf with the garments of piety, that he may cover the inſtruments of cruelty, and do a miſchief unſuſpected. <hi>Saul</hi> was a hypocrite, and falſe with God, yet how did he encourage <hi>David</hi> to follow the War, and <hi>fight the Lord's battels</hi> againſt the uncircumciſed Philiſtines;
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:104248:393"/> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.17.) whereas <hi>Saul</hi> ſought not the honour of God at all, nor the overthrow of the Philiſtines, ſo much, as the overthrow of <hi>David;</hi> his intent was to take his own revenge upon <hi>David,</hi> rather then Gods revenge on them: for he hoped <hi>David</hi> would one time or other over-act his valour againſt the Philiſtines, and loſe his life, to win honour and reputation. How religiouſly did <hi>Abner</hi> (who was a great Prince as <hi>David</hi> called him) urge the promiſe of God to make <hi>David</hi> King, (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.18.) and yet 'tis plain in the Text, that his deſigne was to revenge himſelf upon <hi>Iſhbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth,</hi> who had put (as he thought) an affront upon him, rather then to be inſtrumental for the fulfilling of the promiſe of God to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid. Jezebel</hi> a great Queen proclaimed a Faſt (which is one of the higheſt acts of Religion) while her purpoſe was only to get an opportunity to feaſt her ſelf upon the deſtruction of <hi>Naboth,</hi> and to drink his innocent blood. <hi>Herod</hi> a King (<hi>Matth.</hi> 2.8.) deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have the young childe Chriſt, <hi>that he might come and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him,</hi> but his deſigne was to murder him; and becauſe he could not have his will to kill him alone, he reſolved to kill him in the multitude, commanding all the infants of ſuch an age to be ſlain, leſt he ſhould eſcape. We have a ſad inſtance of this in two of the Patriarcks, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 34.) I do not ſay they were hypocrites, but, I ſay, they acted a high ſtrain of hypocriſie, and put on a religious pretence for the compaſſing of revenge. <hi>Dinah, Jacobs</hi> daughter being deflowred by <hi>Shechem,</hi> he ſued to have her for his wife, and would wipe off the ſtain of his luſt by a legal marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; old <hi>Hamor</hi> pleaded for his ſon, and <hi>Jacob</hi> was willing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough ('tis like) to ſalve the credit of his daughter; but the ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> anſwered <hi>Shechem</hi> and <hi>Hamor</hi> his father deceitfully (<hi>v.</hi> 13.) and they ſaid, we cannot match with you, except you be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and ſo become Proſelytes to our Religion. If <hi>Shechem</hi> will be of their family, he muſt be of their faith; they ſtood not upon their ſiſters joynture, the matter ſtuck only upon a ſcruple of conſcience. What argument of greater zeal for God could they have given then this? Yet while theſe religious words were in their mouths, they had bloody ſwords in their hearts: And all this pretence for circumciſion, was only that they might have an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to come upon them in their ſoreneſs and deſtroy them; which (as the holy ſtory tells us) they ſoon after effected.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Hypocrites often deſigne worldly gain, and ayme at
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:104248:394"/> the purſe more then at God in all their holy ſervices. Many take up a profeſſion of Religion, as all men take up a Trade, <hi>that they may get a Living by it;</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.5.) who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>urpoſe <hi>that gain is godlineſs;</hi> whereas he ſaith (<hi>verſ.</hi> 6.) <hi>Godlineſs with contentment is great gain,</hi> they ſay, <hi>Gain is godlineſs;</hi> And all they look at by their profeſſion of godlineſs, is worldly gain. Religion is often made (as the Apoſtles word is, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.5.) <hi>a cloak of covetouſneſs;</hi> and he profeſſeth in the ſame place, that in the diſpenſation of the Goſpel, he had not uſed his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery as ſuch a cloak, God was his witneſs; but there are many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom (though men cannot) yet their own conſciences do, and God will witneſs, that their appearance in Religion is but the hiding of, or a cloak for their covetouſneſs. <hi>Hamor</hi> and <hi>Shechem</hi> uſed no other argument to perſwade their Citizens to take upon them the ſeal of the Covenant, but only this, <hi>Shall not their cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and their ſubſtance, and every beaſt of theirs, be ours?</hi> (Gen. 34.27.) And it ſeems the very mention of their own emolument overcame them; they thought it a bargain well made, to ſell a little of their blood at ſo high a rate, and to exchange their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins for ſo many head of Cattel. And hence it is, that among thoſe ſeven ſorts of Phariſees collected out of the Talmud, the firſt are called <hi>Phariſaei Shechemitae,</hi> receiving (it ſeems) both their Order and Denomination from theſe Shechemites, becauſe as they turned Hebrewes, ſo theſe became Phariſees upon the hopes of worldly benefit. And ſuch were thoſe Phariſees in truth, whatſoever their Title was, <hi>who</hi> (as was touched before) <hi>devoured widdows houſes, and in a pretence made long prayers.</hi> As it is a very great point of ungodlineſs (prophaneneſs indeed) to ſay, <hi>What profit is there in ſerving the Lord?</hi> So it is groſs hypocriſie to take up Religion meerly for profit; there is profit, even worldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in Religion; <hi>Godlineſs is profitable for all things,</hi> (1 Tim. 4.8.) <hi>and hath the promiſe of this life as well as of that to come;</hi> but wo to thoſe that take it up deſigning profit, and the filling either of their purſes, or their bellies. Our Saviours Divine Spirit quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered this carnal ſpirit in his followers, (<hi>John</hi> 6.26.) <hi>Ye ſeek me not becauſe ye ſaw the miracles, but becauſe ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled: Judas</hi> followed Chriſt, but the motive of it, was in the bag, (<hi>John</hi> 12.6.) The zeal of <hi>Demetrius</hi> to his Idol <hi>Diana,</hi> was kindled by as pure a fire as the zeal of theſe hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:104248:394"/> to Jeſus Chriſt, (<hi>Acts</hi> 19.24.) <hi>By this we get our living.</hi> They know nothing of the life of Religion, who are religious on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they may live: If profit be the Loadſtone of our profeſſion, our profeſſion will never profit us; for what ſhall it profit a man to gain the whole world by a profeſſion of the name of Chriſt, if he loſe his own ſoul? Sathan charged <hi>Job</hi> with this groſs hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, (<hi>chap.</hi> 1.9.) <hi>Doth Job fear God for nought?</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> findes 'tis no lean buſineſs to be religious, and therefore no wonder if he be found ſo religious. Who would not do and be as much as he in Religion, to have his fields full of Cattel, and his folds full of Sheep, and his houſe full of Riches? He knows well enough which ſide his bread is buttered on, what makes for his profit; all the account he makes of Religion is, that he perceives by his books, and the inventory of his goods, that it turns every year to a good account: <hi>Jobs</hi> ſlander is the juſt charge of many, they uſe Religion but as a ſtalking horſe, to catch worldly riches.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The groſſe hypocrite often deſignes, that which is higher in the eſteeme, and more taking upon the ſpirits of many then worldly riches, even worldly power, or to get very high, if not uppermoſt in the world. 'Tis no new thing for men to make religion a ſtayre to aſcend the higheſt roomes among men, or a ſtirrup to get into the ſaddle of honour, and when they have got high enough, then downe with the ſtayres, or 'tis no matter for the ſtirrup by which they aſcended. <hi>Jehu</hi> was very zealous in the cauſe of God, and for reformation, but his deſigne was for a kingdome, or his owne exaltation (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.16.) he made a noyſe of much piety, <hi>Come ſee my zeale for the Lord,</hi> yet all was but a piece of State-hypocriſie. His care in deſtroying <hi>Ahabs</hi> houſe and <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts (according to the command of God) was but to pave the way to the throne. The ſame way <hi>Abſolom</hi> was taking to his fathers Crowne; he told the people he was troubled that they were no better governed, that they had no quicker diſpatch in their ſuites and buſineſſes; he told his father he had made a vow, and deſired the liberty of his abſence from Court, that he might goe and performe it; all he pretended was righteouſneſſe and religion, yet he intended only to get an advan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

He ſaw the times ſerved him not to act the pagan openly, and therefore he ſubtlely betooke himſelfe to his diſguiſe, and perſonated the Chriſtian, even in the mortified way of a mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke life,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Thus I have touch't upon the foure grand deſignes of the Groſſe hypocrite: Firſt, praiſe among all men; Secondly, revenge upon ſome men; Thirdly, the gaine of worldly riches; Fourthly, the attainment of power, dominion, and Greatneſs in the world. Theſe are as the foure wheeles of Satans chariot, wherein he hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth thouſands to the land of darkneſs, while they would be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med children of the light. Or ſome one of theſe is as the <hi>(pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum mobile)</hi> firſt mover (of which Philoſophers ſpeake in their doctrine of the heavens) carrying many with a rapt and violent motion in the ſpheare of religion, while they have in the Interim a ſecret undiſcerned natural motion of their owne directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to this, by which they hope at laſt to ſteale on faire and ſoftly to their wiſhed periods.</p>
                  <p>Having thus farre ſhewed the cloſe purpoſes of the deſigning hypocrite, who is ſo hatefull to God and hurtfull to man, I ſhall a little diſcover and unmaske his hypocriſie, by ſhewing how we may know him, how we may looke through theſe vayles and ſee his ugly face.</p>
                  <p>Deſigning hypocrites are uſually diſcovered theſe foure wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By their affectation to be ſeene and taken notice of; they that will have praiſe and glory with men, muſt needs affect to be ſeene of men; for no glory comes to man, from men, but by what falls under the eye and obſervation of man. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of <hi>murderers</hi> (Chap: 24.13.) <hi>They are of thoſe that rebell againſt the light, they know not the wayes thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.</hi> The murderer cannot endure the light either natural or moral, becauſe that tells who he is, or what he hath been about. The contrary, in one ſenſe, is true of the hypocrite, he loveth the
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:104248:395"/> light, and will doe nothing willingly, but as he may be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and ſeene of men; as for thoſe acts or exerciſes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which are private retirements between God and his owne ſoule, he is a great ſtranger to them, he cannot delight in them, but any thing that may fall under publick obſervation, he can be forward enough in. Chriſt (<hi>Math.</hi> 6.5.) gives us this plaine diſcovery of the hypocricall Phariſees; <hi>They love to pray ſtanding in the Synagogues, and in the corners of the ſtreets, that they may be ſeene of men.</hi> This was ſo much in <hi>Jehu's</hi> heart, that he could not but blab it out with his tongue (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.) <hi>Come ſee my zeale;</hi> A falſe fire kindled his zeale, elſe he had not made ſuch a blaze. It was, inſincere rotten-hearted <hi>Saul</hi> that ſayd (1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 15.13.) <hi>Come thou bleſſed of the Lord, I have performed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Lord;</hi> he was his owne trumpeter, and would needs tell the ſtory of his doings himſelfe, though he had done his buſineſſe to halves; <hi>Come thou bleſſed of the Lord, I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the commandement of the Lord;</hi> as if it would not ſerve him to doe his duty, unleſſe <hi>Samuel</hi> had ſeene and taken notice of him. <hi>Abraham</hi> gave proofe of the higheſt act of faith that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was in the world, yet did <hi>Abraham</hi> ſay, <hi>Come ſee my faith? Moſes</hi> led the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> forty yeares in the wilderneſſe through a ſeries of wonderfull tryalls and temptations, to the very borders of <hi>Canaan</hi> (which was one of the higheſt ſervices that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man undertook) <hi>and was faithfull in all his houſe</hi> (Heb: 4.2.) yet did he ſay, <hi>Come ſee my fidelity? Joſhua</hi> victoriouſly expelled the <hi>Cananites,</hi> and divided their land by lot among the tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet did he ſay, <hi>Come ſee my fortitude?</hi> We heare not a word of any of their doings from thoſe who were ſincere. When we ſee men forward to invite the approbation of others by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reports of their good deeds, it gives a ſtrong argument of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, that they have done what they have done with a bad heart, or, that (as it is ſayd of <hi>Jehu) they have not ſought God with all their hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome may object, Did not <hi>Samuel</hi> proclaime his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity before all the people (1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 12.3.) <hi>Whoſe oxe have I taken? or whoſe aſſe have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppreſſed? or of whoſe hand have I received any bribe, to blind mine eyes therewith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer; <hi>Samuel</hi> ſpake this to upbraid their ingratitude and
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:104248:396"/> diſcontent, not to extoll his owne juſtice; yea ſome conceive that he made this challenge, to give <hi>Saul</hi> a patterne how he ought to governe, rather then to commend his owne government. I find the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> making large reports of his owne both doings and ſufferings (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 11.) But if we peruſe that Chapter, we ſhall find him hovering in a ſuſpence of doubts and feares, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no it were convenient or comely for him to doe ſo. How many preambles and Apologyes did he make before he fell di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly upon that unpleaſing ſubject? <hi>Would to God ye could beare with me in my folly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and indeed beare with me.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>I ſpeake</hi> (as it were) <hi>fooliſhly in this confidence of boaſting.</hi> And yet all that he ſpake was not to make a boaſt of himſelfe, but to vindicate his Apoſtleſhip from unjuſt and envious calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niations.</p>
                  <p>'Tis moſt certaine, He that is ſincere deſires not to be open, but ſilently ſatisfieth his ſoule with the conſcience of doing his duty, and takes more content, in knowing his own integrity, then in knowing that others know it. Vertue looſeth nothing of her value, in his eſteeme, no nor of her luſtre in his eye, becauſe ſhe is hidden from the eyes of men. Like the earth (in this poynt) he keepes his richeſt mineralls, and moſt precious gems of grace and goodneſs below in his bowells, or at the center of his heart, and will not let them be ſeene, till a kind of neceſſity diggs them out. When <hi>Moſes</hi> after his forty dayes neere acceſſe to and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in the Mount, perceived that his face did ſhine (<hi>Exod:</hi> 34.33.) he put a vayle upon it; every true <hi>Moſes</hi> whoſe acquaintance and fiduciall familiarity with God, hath ſtampt upon him the impreſſions of divine light, is ſo farre from affecting to dazzle the eyes of others with it, that he rather puts a vayle of gracious modeſty upon it; and will not let ſo much as the light of his good workes be ſeene, but as thereby (in which caſe Chriſt commands it (<hi>Math:</hi> 5.16.) <hi>He may glorifie his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heaven.</hi> And herein a Chriſtian followeth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt, in whom though the Godhead dwelt bodily, yet he rarely ſhewed his divine power. And when once by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, he had made the blind ſee, he alſo by command made them dumbe concerning that miracle (<hi>Math:</hi> 9.30.) <hi>See that no man know it.</hi> It was our Saviours counſel to all his followers (<hi>Mat:</hi> 6.5.) <hi>Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth,</hi> and it was his
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:104248:396"/> conſolation to them in the next words; <hi>Your father which ſeeth in ſecret, himſelfe ſhall reward you openly;</hi> yea (which is a higher conſolation then that) <hi>Himſelfe will be your reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the deſigning hypocrite deſires to be ſeene in doing good, or to have the good which he hath done ſeene; ſo he is exceeding cenſorious and rigid towards thoſe whom he ſees fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into evill. Chriſt gives this diſcovery alſo (<hi>Math:</hi> 7.3.) <hi>Why beholdeſt thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye, but conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not the beame that is in thine owne eye;</hi> concluding at the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>Thou hypocrite</hi> (why doth Chriſt call him hypocrite? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe he was ſo quick-ſighted to ſee a mote, that is, a ſmaller fault in his brothers eye, but tooke no notice of the beame that was in his owne eye; a ſpot upon his brothers coate, was cenſured more by him, then his owne wallowing in the mire. I doe not ſay that the Patriarke <hi>Judah</hi> was an hypocrite, but, as thoſe two other <hi>Patriacks,</hi> ſo he acted one very groſſe part of hypocriſie (<hi>Gen.</hi> 38.24.) For he no ſooner heard that <hi>Tamor</hi> was with childe, but he cenſured, yea condemn'd her preſently to death; <hi>Bring her forth</hi> (ſayd he) <hi>and let her be burnt;</hi> and yet himſelfe was more faulty then ſhe. How hard a Judge was he of that crime in another, which was principally his owne? <hi>Saul</hi> had ſinned greatly (1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 13.9.) in offering ſacrifice before <hi>Samuel</hi> came, which was an uſurpation of the Prieſts office, and ſo great a ſin that <hi>Samuel</hi> told him preſently, <hi>God would therefore rend the Kingdome from him;</hi> yet he thought to put it off with a ſlight excuſe. But in the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter when <hi>Jonathan</hi> only offended againſt a raſh command of his (putting a Curſe upon that people if any did eate before the going downe of the Sun) he ſentenced him to death for it. In the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> How ſevere were the Phariſees to the woman taken in Adultery, they haled her before Chriſt, and preſſed the Law that ſhe ſhould be ſtoned to death; yet, when Chriſt ſayd (<hi>v.</hi> 7.) <hi>He that is without ſin among you, let him firſt caſt a ſtone at her, they being convicted by their owne conſcience, went out one by one.</hi> We ought to reprove and not flatter ſin in others; yet they who are extreamely ſevere againſt a ſin in others, uſually favour either the ſame or a worſe in themſelves.

<pb n="772" facs="tcp:104248:397"/> kept him in or from theſe temptations.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The deſigning hypocrite diſcovers himſelfe by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe or departing from the profeſſion of religion, when his worldly ends are attained. Feined zeale cooles or abates, is leſſe and leſſe towards the things of God, as ſuch zelots grow warmer and warmer in their neſts, and find their carnal intereſts more and more ſerved or ſecured. 'Tis reported by a Popiſh Author, that a Fryar or Monke was obſerved very preciſe, and circumſpect in all his wayes, hanging downe his head to the earth, very hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and devoutly, as if he meditated continually upon his morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or returne to the earth; who afterwards being choſen Abbot or Governour of the Covent, grew very proud, high and inſolent. Some, wondring at this change of behaviour, tooke the boldneſs to aske him the reaſon of it; <hi>O,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I was but ſeeking the keyes of the Abbey, and now I have found them.</hi> Having gotten what he ſought for, he layd aſide his ſtrictneſs in religion, and threw off his vayle. When <hi>Jehu</hi> that hypocrite was in his way to the Kingdome, how zealous was he? yet no ſooner ſetled in it, but he was unſetled in religion, &amp; turned Idolater, worſhipping the Calves that were in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> When <hi>Julian</hi> had obtained the Empire, he had done with Chriſt, and gave all the world a full argument againſt himſelfe, that he was but a hypocrite in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer profeſſion of Chriſtianity. <hi>David</hi> was as zealous for God and as holy when he was upon the throne, as when he kept ſheepe upon the Mountaines, as good when a princely traine followed him, as when he followed the Ewes great with young. <hi>Moſes</hi> was as faithfull when he was the ruler of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as when he was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile in <hi>Midian. Joſeph</hi> was as gracious when he wore a chaine of Gold, and had the power of all <hi>Egypt</hi> put into his hand, as when himſelfe was a priſoner in <hi>Potiphers</hi> houſe, and the iron (chaines) entred into his ſoule. <hi>I feare God</hi> (ſayd he, <hi>Gen:</hi> 42.18.) when he had no man to feare. And when after his fathers death, his brethren feared he would reckon with them for their old faults, or at leaſt be careleſſe of and unkind to them, who had been ſo unkind and cruel to him, yet he would doe them nothing but kindneſſes and courteſies, and thereof bid them be confident, (<hi>Gen:</hi> 50.21.)</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, As ſucceſſe diſcovereth ſome hypocrites, ſo the croſſe diſcovereth many more. The hypocrite will run from his
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:104248:397"/> colours when he comes to the battel, or ſeeth he muſt either quit the truths of God, or his owne peace. If once he findeth that he cannot thrive by religion, he will meddle no more with it. There is a generation who will appeare no further for truth, then ſerves their owne turne; and when they ſee they cannot ſerve that, by holding the truth, they will neither hold nor profeſſe it any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. They will venter no further in ſuch matters, then they may make a faire retreate, if they ſee themſelves in danger, or cannot carry onne their owne intereſts. Thus the ſecond ground is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed (<hi>Math:</hi> 13.20, 21.) <hi>He that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; yet hath he not roote in himſelfe, but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for a while, for when tribulation or perſecution ariſeth becauſe of the word, by and by he is offended.</hi> He hath enough of the word, when he ſeeth he cannot have that, and enough of the world too. Many will get aboard the ſhip of the true Church in a calme, who if they ſee the clouds gather, the ayre darken, the winds riſing, the ſtorme coming, they dare not ride it out in an angry Sea, but will be calling for the boate, and row to the next ſhoare. Theſe never purpoſed to endure all winds and weathers, with the Church of God, but hoped to be tranſported to the <hi>cape of their worldly good hope, and wiſhed for earthly haven.</hi> Their ſlight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets their intents, and liſts them among deſigning hypocrites. The houſe founded on the ſand, ſheweth as faire in a faire day, as that founded on a rocke; But when the raine deſcends, and the flouds come, and the winds blow, you may diſtinguiſh it, by the down-fall. He was never more nor better then a meere out-ſide profeſſor, who doth not hold faſt his profeſſion in a day of trouble as wel as in a day of peace; in the greateſt diſtreſſe, as wel as in the higheſt ſucceſſe and triumph of the people of God in this world.</p>
                  <p>To ſhut up this poynt and obſervation, I ſhall only give three or foure conſiderations, which may move all to take heed of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie. Chriſt ſaith (<hi>Luke</hi> 12.1.) <hi>Beware of the Leven of the Phariſees which is hypocriſie.</hi> As Leven ſowres the whole lump of bread, ſo do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h hypocriſie both the perſons and converſations of thoſe who are infected with it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Beware of hypocriſie, or of hiding what you are, for what you are, doth alwayes appeare to God, though not to men; <hi>All things are naked and manifeſt unto the eyes of him with whom
<pb n="774" facs="tcp:104248:398"/> we have to doe</hi> (Heb: 4.13.) though we are painted over, though we are cloaked, and hooded, and vizarded with pretences, yet we are naked before the eye of God. And that was the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with which God preſſed <hi>Abraham</hi> to beware of hypocriſie (<hi>Gen:</hi> 17.1.) <hi>Walke before me and be thou perfect;</hi> that is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thou art alwayes in my eye and ſight, therefore take heed of falſeneſſe and inſincerity. We uſe to ſay, <hi>There is no halting before a Criple;</hi> Criples know whether yours be a fained or reall lameneſſe. O take heed of halting before God, he knoweth how it is with you, he knoweth the temper of your ſoules, as wel as the body of your converſations; he doth not only know what you doe, but with what aimes, with what heart and purpoſe you doe it. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayd (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.5.) <hi>We have not uſed a cloake of covetouſneſſe, God is witneſſe.</hi> As if he had ſayd, God will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee through us, and find out our covetouſneſſe, though we cover it with never ſo thicke or faire a cloake of devotional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider, as the Lord ſeeth through you, ſo he will make you throughly ſeene, he will make you knowne or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maske you before men one time or other. As he will <hi>bring forth the righteouſneſſe of a godly man as the light</hi> (after it hath been long hid under the darkneſſe of uncharitable ſuſpitions or falſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) <hi>and his juſt dealing as the noone day,</hi> Pſal: 37.6.) ſo he will bring forth the unrighteouſneſſe of a hypocrite as the light, and his falſe-dealing as the noone-day, though it have layne hid a while under the cloake and faire colours of the moſt pious ſemblances and proteſtations. God loves to uncaſe hypocrites, becauſe he is a God of truth; and becauſe it magnifieth his truth, juſtice, and omniſcience to do ſo. And he doth it many times, by letting them fall into foule ſins; they make faire ſhewes in religion, through reſtraining grace, and as ſoone as that bridle of reſtraining grace is let looſe, that very ſhew is gone, and they ſhew plainly what they are. <hi>The cloſeſt deſigning hypocrites, often prove open Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates;</hi> and though ſome may abide long, (poſſibly as long as they live) in this vaine ſhew or forme of Godlineſs, without diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their rottenneſs, yet at laſt their rottenneſs ſhall be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for as <hi>Solomon</hi> aſſureth us (<hi>Eccleſ:</hi> 12.14.) <hi>God will bring every worke to Judgement, and every ſecret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evill.</hi> Or as the Apoſtle hath it, (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 4.5.)
<pb n="775" facs="tcp:104248:398"/> 
                     <hi>He will diſcover the ſecrets of the heart, and bring to light the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things of darkneſſe;</hi> which, what are they, but the hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call deſignings of men? We ſay, <hi>murder will out,</hi> and 'tis as true, <hi>Hypocriſie will out.</hi> The Lord many times brings it out to the ſhame of hypocrites in this life, and he will bring it out to the confuſion of all their faces, in that great day, when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be revealed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Take heed of this deſigning hypocriſie; for as all who continue in it ſhall be diſcovered, ſo uſually they continue in it; your plotting cunning hypocrites, are very rarely converted. Simple hypocrites (in the notion toucht before) are often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; all unconverted perſons that make any profeſſion in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are hypocrites, and many of them are ſimple ones, they hope all is well with them, and that they have grace, though they have it not, theſe are often converted, but groſs deſigning hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, of what rank or degree ſoever, are rarely converted. This is it which Chriſt ſaid to the Phariſees, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 21.31.) <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Harlots enter into the Kingdome of heaven before you;</hi> Publicans were the worſt ſort of men, and harlots were the worſt ſort of women, yet theſe repented and received the Goſpel ſooner then the hypocritical Phariſees. The Evangeliſt made a like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of them (<hi>Luke</hi> 7.29, 30.) <hi>All the people</hi> (that is, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of people) <hi>that heard him, and the Publicans, juſtified God, being baptized with the baptiſme of John, but the Phariſees and Lawyers rejected the counſel of God againſt themſelves, being not baptized of him;</hi> yea, as Chriſt ſpeaks in the next words, they were piped to, but they would not dance; they were wept to, but they would not mourn. All thoſe various diſpenſations of the Goſpel were fruitleſs to them; neither a more pleaſing nor a more ſevere Miniſtery won any thing upon that generation of deſigning hypocrites.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, conſider, As hypocrites are hateful to God, ſo God will deal with them accordingly; he will for ever ſeparate them from his preſence, and caſt them out of his ſight. A hypocrite hath a double minde, a divided heart; he is not half enough for God, (indeed he is nothing at all for God) and he is too much, yea altogether for himſelf, and therefore he ſhall have no hing at all of God, not ſo much as a ſight of him. It is ſaid in the 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Job, The hypocrite ſhall not come before him:</hi> Such as we hate,
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:104248:399"/> we cannot endure they ſhould come in our ſight: 'Tis a ſutable judgement, that they who have ſo often come before God with falſe hearts, and mocked him with a ſeeming deſire of being in his preſence, ſhould at laſt be thruſt for ever out of his preſence. 'Tis the portion of an hypocrite to have no portion in God, of whom he hath made ſuch a boaſting profeſſion. When the worſt of puniſhments is ſpoken of, it is called the hypocrites portion (<hi>Math:</hi> 24.51.) <hi>Give them their portion with hypocrites in the Lake that burnes with fire and brimſtone.</hi> Hypocrites are ſpoken of as if they were the <hi>free-holders of hell,</hi> or as if all other ſinners that ſhall goe to hell were but as inmates, and they the grand te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of hell. Conſider how miſerable a thing it is to be an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, if this be the portion of hypocrites, to have no portion in God. And as they ſhall not reigne at all in the glory of the next world, ſo they are ſometimes checkt (ſaith the text) from reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the glory of this world.</p>
                  <q>That the hypocrite reigne not.</q>
                  <p>Reigning, as was ſhewed before, being ſtrictly taken, is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of ſupreame power, and in a large ſenſe may ſignifie the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of any power, or a ſtate of great proſperity.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Secondly.</p>
                  <q>Hypocrites are high minded, and look after great things.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> was a king, he reigned over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but it was not his owne ambition, but the election of God, and his anointing, which brought him to the throne. He could ſay of himſelfe (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 131.1.) <hi>Lord my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither doe I exerciſe my ſelfe in great matters, or in things too high for me.</hi> Though <hi>David</hi> was high in his perſon and ſtate, yet his ſpirit was not high; nor was his ſpirit for high things, only God placed him on high. But here we ſee the hypocrite is climbing and getting to the top of the ſtaires, he is aſcending even to the throne. <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites are proud of that nothing which they have and are in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualls, and they would have all, they would get high, they would be higheſt in temporalls.</hi> There are two luſts which uſually reigne in hypocrites, and both of them reſpect the world.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The luſt of covetouſneſſe, which is an inordinate deſire of getting and keeping the riches of this world. The Phariſees all
<pb n="777" facs="tcp:104248:399"/> the Goſpel over are taxed for hypocrites; and when Chriſt had preached that parable of the unjuſt Steward, concluding with this ſentence, <hi>Ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon;</hi> The Evangeliſt tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us (<hi>Luke</hi> 16.14.) <hi>The Phariſees alſo who were covetous, heard all theſe things, and they derided him.</hi> Covetouſneſſe and hypocriſie goe together; They who have no true hungrings and thirſtings after the things of heaven, are moſt hungry and thirſty after earthly things. We finde <hi>Job</hi> in the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of this Booke (<hi>v.</hi> 8.) ſpeaking of the hypocrites gaine; <hi>What is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his ſoule;</hi> which implyeth that the hypocrite is a great aimer at worldly gaine.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond predominant luſt of the hypocrite is, ambition, or deſire of getting to the upper end of the world. Chriſt chargeth the hypocriticall Phariſees with this luſt alſo (<hi>Math:</hi> 23.6. <hi>Mark</hi> 12.39.) <hi>They love the uppermoſt roomes at feaſts, and the higheſt ſeats in the Synagogues.</hi> They are all to be uppermoſt, they muſt have the uppermoſt roomes at feaſts, and the higheſt ſeats in the Synagogue, both in Civill and Church-meetings; hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites affected ſuperiority, or, <hi>Diotrephes</hi>-like, to have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, <hi>and</hi> (which was another ſymptome of ambition) <hi>they</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>love greetings in the market place, and to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Rabbi, Rabbi,</hi> which is a title of greatneſs and maſterſhip. Yea many hypocrites would not only have the uppermoſt ſeats at feaſts, and in the Synagogues, but the very uppermoſt ſeats in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; Common-wealths; <hi>They ſometimes affect to be the head, who are worſe then the tayle of all the people.</hi> There are hypocrites of all ranks, and among all degrees of men, ſome of low degree are in a very high degree of hypocriſie; There are hypocrites in raggs and in ruſſet, there are hypocrites alſo in ſcarlet and in purple; hypocriſie may reigne in and among thoſe that reigne. It is a maxime which ſome Princes have held out to all the world, as the rule of their reigning; <hi>He that knoweth not how to diſſemble,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Qui neſcit diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulare neſcit regnore.</note> 
                     <hi>knows not how to reigne.</hi> Diſſimulation is a great part of hypocriſie, there is diſſimulation both as to the things of God, and the things of men; Some if they knew not how to diſſemble in both (at leaſt) with men, would not believe that they knew how to rule over, or governe men. Now as many who are great, and in power, make little conſcience to diſſemble, or make uſe of hypocriſie, to carry
<pb n="778" facs="tcp:104248:400"/> on their government, and ſecure themſelves; ſo moſt hypocrites have a mind, and will uſe all meanes (not forbearing thoſe which are bad enough) to get into power, and make themſelves great. The ſpirit of hypocriſie is an aſpiring ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Againe, <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the hypocrite reigne not, leſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be enſnared;</hi> here's not one word of the good government or protection of the people, which ſhould be the maine buſineſſe of thoſe that reigne; The text ſpeaks only of ſnares; <hi>That the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite reigne not, leſt the people be enſnared.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve; Thirdly.</p>
                  <q>Hypocrites getting into power, doe either ſecretly or openly wrong and oppreſſe the people.</q>
                  <p>They lay ſnares for them in ſtead of being ſhields to them. Hypocrites in power, enſnare chiefly two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By their ill example, there is a great ſnare in that; Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors are very apt to be formed up according to their mould and manners who are above them;<note place="margin">R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gis ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplum totus componitur or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis.</note> the example of Kings and Princes are ſeldome unconformed to by their Subjects. There is a great power in example, what is done perſwades, as wel as what is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. And <hi>the errors of thoſe that rule, become rules of error;</hi> men ſin with a kind of authority, through the ſins of thoſe who are in authority. <hi>Jeroboam made Iſrael to ſin,</hi> not only by commanding them to worſhip the Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> but by commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Idolatous worſhip to them in his owne practiſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They enſnare the people by ſinfull and bad Lawes; The Prophet denounceth a woe diſtinctly unto men of ſeverall ranks and places (<hi>Hoſ:</hi> 5.1.) <hi>Heare ye this, O Prieſts, and hearken ye houſe of Iſrael, and give ye eare, O houſe of the King;</hi> he directs his ſpeech, in that three-fold diviſion; Firſt, to the Prieſts; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the body of the people; Thirdly, and chiefly to the houſe of the King, why to the houſe of the King? <hi>Becauſe ye have been a ſnare on Mizpah, and a net ſpread upon Tabor.</hi> That Scripture may be interpreted; Firſt, as an alluſion to ſuch as were wont to hunt upon thoſe mountaines; <hi>Mizpah</hi> and <hi>Tabor</hi> were famous places for hunting, there they were wont to ſet netts, and lay ſnares to catch their game; now, ſaith the Prophet, ye have been even like hunters ſpreading netts and laying ſnares. <hi>Nimrod</hi> is
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:104248:400"/> called a <hi>mighty hunter before God;</hi> He was a hunter of men more then of wild beaſts. Now, look what nets and ſnares are to wild beaſts, the ſame are ſinfull lawes to the conſciences of honeſt and upright-hearted men. And it is wel conceived that the Prophet there referrs to thoſe enſnaring Lawes made by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the ſucceeding Princes in the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whereby they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to draw off the people of God from his true worſhip, and vexed thoſe who kept cloſe to it. Secondly, ſome expound thoſe words, <hi>Ye have been a ſnare on Mizpah, and a net ſpread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Tabor,</hi> to ſignifie their ſetting ſpies upon thoſe mountaines to watch and ſo to give information, who went to the ſolemne feaſts, that ſo they might be proceeded againſt according to thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring Laws. Which way ſoever we take it, 'tis cleare, that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reproves and threatens Judgement againſt the Prieſts and Apoſtatizing people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> complying with if not provoking the the ruling powers to trouble thoſe who could not digeſt the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous worſhip ſet up by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> at <hi>Dan</hi> &amp; <hi>Bethel,</hi> upon a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique conſideration, leſt the people going to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhould fall off from him, and weaken the kingdome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his hand. Another Prophet complained (<hi>Mic:</hi> 6.16.) <hi>The Statutes of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri are kept. Omri</hi> was a king of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a ſucceſſor of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> both in his power and hypocriſie, he alſo pretended a zeale for the worſhip of God after his owne deviſing, and therefore made en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring Statutes to entangle thoſe that were ſincere, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the true worſhip which the Statutes of God appoynted. The Prophet ſpeakes of a ſtrange kind of bridle, or of a bridle u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for an unuſuall purpoſe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.28.) <hi>There ſhall be a bridle in the jawes of the people cauſing them to erre.</hi> A bridle is put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of a horſe or mule, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 32.9.) not to cauſe either to erre or goe out of the way, but to keep them in the way. 'Tis evident by the context of this Chapter, as alſo by the expreſſe text of the 37<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter (<hi>v.</hi> 29.) that this bridle was the Lords power againſt <hi>Senacharib</hi> and his hoſt, whereby as with a bridle in their jawes he diverted them from their purpoſe of beſiedging <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 'Tis a truth alſo (to which we may warrantably enough apply thoſe words of the Prophet in a way of alluſion) that good lawes are like a bridle in the jawes of a people, the multitude or the moſt would elſe be like head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong horſes, if authority did not keep them in. 'Tis a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="780" facs="tcp:104248:401"/> when Laws are as a bridle to keep us from erring, but 'tis ſad when <hi>any Lawes are a bridle in the jawes of a people cauſing them to erre,</hi> or go out of the way of the Laws of God; ſuch Laws are not (which all Lawes ſhould be) rules, but ſnares. Such were the Lawes of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and the Statutes of <hi>Omri</hi> in Iſrael of old; and what Nation is there that hath not had experience in one age, or other, of ſuch Lawes as have been a bridle in their jawes cauſing them to erre, or a ſnare to their ſouls and conſciences?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, When <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the hypocrite reigne not, leſt the people be enſnared,</hi> he intends an act of divine wrath, upon hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, abuſing their power to the hurt of the people.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>God is highly diſpleaſed with Princes and Magiſtrates when they enſnare the people.</q>
                  <p>We read (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.12.) how the people of Iſrael were enſnared, and how the Lord was highly diſpleaſed with thoſe who did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare them. <hi>O my people, they which lead thee, cauſe thee to erre, and deſtroy the way of thy paths.</hi> Thy Leaders miſlead thee. There are two ſorts of Leaders, Firſt, Spiritual Leaders; the Miniſters and Preachers of the Word now, as of old the Prieſts, Levites, and Prophets, were Leaders of the people (and ſomtimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their miſleaders, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.1.3.) in Spirituals. Secondly, There are Leaders of the people in Civil things; ſuch are all Princes and Magiſtrates. We may underſtand that Text in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> of both theſe Leaders; as if he had ſaid, <hi>Thy Prophets and thy Princes miſlead thee, and cauſe thee to erre;</hi> And therefore at <hi>ver.</hi> 14. of the ſame chapter, God declareth his diſpleaſure againſt them, profeſſing that he would <hi>enter into judgement with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients of his people, and the Princes thereof.</hi> The ſame Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (chap. 9.16.) complains of the ſame thing again; <hi>The Leaders of this people cauſe them to erre, and they that are lead of them are deſtroyed.</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>they that bleſs this people,</hi> (ſo we put it in the margin,) The Leaders of the people were ſo called, either becauſe it was a part of their office, to pronounce the bleſſing upon the people; or becauſe the falſe Prophets uſed to ſooth up the people in their ſins; and (as another Prophet hath it) to ſow pillows under their elbows, as if they were in a very bleſſed condition, and ſhould do well enough, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:104248:401"/> all the clamours of the true Prophets againſt them. And ſo the latter words, <hi>they that are led of them,</hi> are ſutable to the former in the Hebrew, being thus read in the margin, <hi>they that are called bleſſed of them;</hi> that is, declared or aſſured by them to be in the right way, and ſo ſuch as ſhould come to a bleſſed end, though indeed their end proved deſtruction. And if they who are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (or called bleſſed) fall into deſtruction, ſurely their miſleaders (who call them bleſſed) ſhall not eſcape. <hi>If the blinde lead the blinde, both fall into the ditch,</hi> (Matth. 15.14.) only the blinde leader, or miſleader, ſhall fall deepeſt into it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>As God is diſpleaſed with the hypocrite when he uſeth his power to enſnare the people, ſo the Lord ſomtimes puts him beſides his power, or takes his power from him, that he may no longer enſnare the people.</q>
                  <p>The ultimate ſcope of the place, is not only to ſhew the Lord diſpleaſed with the hypocrite, but diſplacing him. When the Prophet had ſummon'd all ſorts, Prieſts, and people, and the houſe of the King, he addes, <hi>Judgement is towards you, becauſe ye have been a ſnare upon Mizpah,</hi> (Hoſ. 5.1.) Thus as God pulls down hypocrites, becauſe they are hateful to himſelf, ſo becauſe they are hurtful to others; hurtful to their Civil Liberties, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Intereſts, over which God is tender; hurtful alſo to their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Liberties, and ſoul Intereſts, over which God is more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The Kings of Iſrael (who were very wicked, and did much enſnare the people) went of their Governments, moſt of them, very ſpeedily, God did not let them reigne long; yea, the whole Kingdom of Iſrael (which had not one good King) was diſſolved long before the Kingdom of Judah, which had many good Kings. God did not ſuffer the hypocritical Kings of Iſrael to hold their power, but gave them into the hand of the King of Aſſyria, (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.6.) becauſe (<hi>verſ.</hi> 8.) <hi>they walked in the ſtatutes of the heathen, and of the Kings of Iſrael, which they had made.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the whole verſe I would give one Note by way of Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary.</p>
                  <q>A hypocrite is of all perſons most unfit for publick ſervice.</q>
                  <p>How unfit is he to have power in his hand, who can uſe it no
<pb n="782" facs="tcp:104248:402"/> better, then for the enſnaring of the people? A hypocrite is of a private ſpirit, he is all for himſelf, and therefore moſt unfit for publick truſt. We may ſay of the hypocrite, as the Prophet (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 15.3.) of the Vine, <hi>Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or, will men take a pin of it, to hang a veſſel thereon?</hi> No, it is not fit for that mean purpoſe or ſervice, much leſs would a man take a Vine to hew a beam or a pillar for a houſe out of it. Magiſtrates are as pillars of the houſe, or like great beams, to hold up and faſten all; the hypocrite is ſo far from being fit Timber to make a pillar of the houſe, that he is not fit to make a pin to hang a veſſel on upon the wall. <hi>Power is never ſo improperly employed as in making ſnares,</hi> and yet that's the uſual employment or improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which hypocrites, high or low, put it to.</p>

                     </note>I have thus far opened the Text, and given theſe Notes from it, according to our reading; yet before I paſs from it, I ſhall minde you of another reading or verſion of this whole verſe, which carryeth the ſence quite into another channel. Thus</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Who</hi> (meaning God) <hi>maketh</hi> (or ſuffereth at leaſt) <hi>the hypocrite to reigne, becauſe of the offences or ſins of the people.</hi> The <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſe,</hi> the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and <hi>Vulgar Latine</hi> agree in this, and the dependance (for clearing of it) may be made out thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> having ſhewed in the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, that if <hi>God giveth qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs, none can make trouble;</hi> and that <hi>if he hideth his face, none can behold him, whether it be done againſt a Nation, or againſt a man only,</hi> proceeds in this verſe to ſhew the juſtice of God in puniſhing the people, by putting power into the hypocrites hand.</p>
                  <p>The learned <hi>Mercer,</hi> I grant, is not ſatisfied with this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, as not being ſo ſutable to the Grammatical conſtruction of the Hebrew Text; yet, holding the firſt, he makes this as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of it; confeſſing that it may be taken in this ſenſe; <hi>That the hypocrite reigne not who did once reigne, becauſe of the ſins of the people;</hi> and ſo it intimates the ſins both of the Prince and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Thus both readings correſpond, and are not repugnant but ſubſervient to each other. For if God ſuffer not the hypocrite to reigne any longer, 'tis an argument that for a time he ſuffered him to reigne for the ſins of the people, that is, to be an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his wrath and vengeance upon them for their ſins. The ſame word ſignifies both <hi>a ſnare,</hi> and ſin; a ſnare ſet by others, and an offence or ſin committed by our ſelves; and well it may,
<pb n="783" facs="tcp:104248:402"/> ſeeing nothing doth more enſnare us then our own ſins. And as ſome are led into ſin by the ſnares which others lay for them;<note place="margin">

                     </note> ſo very many by ſinning bring themſelves into ſnares: and uſually when a people have entangled themſelves in the ſnares of ſin, God ſets evil men at once to rule over them and entangle them with the ſnares of thoſe ſufferings which are moſt proper to their ſins.</p>
                  <p>And thus 'tis conceived <hi>Elihu</hi> anſwers thoſe expoſtulating de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which <hi>Job</hi> puts (<hi>chap.</hi> 21.7.) <hi>Wherefore do the wicked live? become old? yea, are mighty in power?</hi> Here are three queſtions, Firſt, <hi>Why do they live?</hi> they are not worthy to breathe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Why become they old?</hi> they deſerve to be cut off in their youth, and not to live out half their dayes. Thirdly, <hi>Why are they mighty?</hi> Why do they command all, who uſe their might only to do miſchief? <hi>Elihu</hi> anſwers theſe queſtions in a word, God giveth power into the hands of evil men, becauſe of the ſins of the people. As if he had ſaid, if at any time you ſee the wicked in great power and proſperity, 'tis a ſigne the people are very wicked, and God will puniſh and ſcourge them by the hands of ſuch for their wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>This is a truth, and much is ſaid by ſome Interpreters for the making of it out from the Text; but taking it as 'tis given, I ſhall only give you two Notes from it.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Bad Princes are ſet up by the permiſſion, yea diſpoſition of God.</q>

                     </note> and very wicked, yet they were all of God's ſetting up, though their own ambition, or the ſatisfying of ſome luſt, put moſt of them upon aſpiring to get up. In the firſt book of the Kings (<hi>chap.</hi> 11.29, 30, 31.) <hi>Ahijah the Prophet finding Jeroboam</hi> (the firſt and worſt of them) <hi>in the way, caught the new Garment that was on him, and rent it into twelve pieces, and he ſaid unto Jeroboam, take thee ten p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="784" facs="tcp:104248:403"/> Tribes to thee.</hi> This <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was ſo bad a man, that he was not content to ſin alone, <hi>but made Iſrael to ſin;</hi> yet even him did God ſet up, and ſent a Prophet to him to tell him ſo. How unholy ſoever men are in their place, and how unjuſt ſoever in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their power, yet the holy and juſt God (for reaſons known to himſelf) placeth them in power.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>God permits wicked Princes to reigne, as a puniſhment of the reigning ſins and wickedneſſes of the people.</q>
                  <p>The power of wicked Princes is the puniſhment of a wicked people.<note place="margin">Quidam reges ad utilitatem ſubjectorum dantur &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervationem juſtitiae qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam autem ad poenam Dei ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto judicio in omnibus aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter ſuperveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente. <hi>Irene. l. 5. c. 25.</hi>
                     </note> Some Princes and Magiſtrates are given as a bleſſing, for the protection, peace, and profit of a Nation, and for the exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of righteouſneſs in it. Others are given as a curſe, for the vexation, trouble, and impoveriſhing of a Nation. The Lord takes this fully upon himſelf, (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.11.) <hi>I gave them a King in mine anger,</hi> &amp;c. Angry providences are the fruit of ſin. God gave <hi>Saul</hi> in anger, he gave <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the reſt of the Iſraelitiſh Kings in anger; and as he gave them in anger, ſo he took them away in wrath. The ſins both of Princes and people, produce mutual ill effects towards one another.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The ſins of the people are the cauſe ſomtimes why good Princes are immaturely or ſuddenly taken away from them. <hi>Joſiah</hi> that good King was removed very early for the ſin of <hi>Judah; Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh Necho</hi> had never ſlain him, had not the people been unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him. Hence that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> (Prov. 28.2.) <hi>for the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a land, many are the Princes thereof:</hi> He means not (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) many together, but many ſucceſſively, that is, good Princes go quickly off the ſtage one after another for the tranſgreſſion of the people of the land; <hi>But</hi> (as it followeth in the ſame verſe) <hi>by a man of underſtanding &amp; knowledg the ſtate thereof ſhal be prolonged.</hi> Our Tranſlaters render theſe latter words in the plural number (as the margin hath it) <hi>by men of underſtanding &amp; wiſdom ſhall they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be prolonged;</hi> that is, when there are many godly, wiſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding men in a Nation, God bleſſeth them with long-lived and aged good Kings or Governours.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whole Nations or a people are ſomtimes puniſhed for the ſins of their Princes, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 15.4.) the Lord tells the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſtate he would bring all that evil upon them for the ſin of

As both by and for their goodneſs and vertues a people are bleſſed, ſo by and for their evills, errors, and vices, a people are endangered, yea ſometimes ruined: When the Head of a Kingdome or Common-wealth is ſicke, the Body is ſeldome well.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The ſins of a people bring deſtruction both upon their Princes and themſelves together, and wrap all up in one ruinous heape, as <hi>Samuel</hi> threatned the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 12.25.) <hi>If ye ſtill doe wickedly, ye ſhall be deſtroyed both you and your King.</hi> He ſpeakes not a word of any ſin in their King, but tells them that their wickedneſſe may bring deſtruction not only upon themſelves, but upon him alſo.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, (which is the poynt in hand) the ſins of a people cauſe the Lord to ſet evill Princes over them. When once a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple refuſe the ſweet and eaſie yoke of Chriſt, or ſay, <hi>we will not have this man to rule over us,</hi> he in Judgement ſends ſuch to rule over them, as ſhall lay heavy yokes upon them indeed. God uſeth ſome Princes as his ſtaff to ſupport a people, and as his ſhield to defend a people, yea as his Sun to cheriſh and influence them with aboundance of mercies. He uſeth others only as his ſword to wound them, or as his ſcourge to correct them for their ſin.<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>O let nations take heed; The ſins of a people, are the worſt ſnares of a people; ſin provokes God to ſet up Princes for a ſnare. As therefore the Pſalmiſt admoniſheth Princes, <hi>Be wiſe now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore O ye Kings, and learned ye Judges of the earth;</hi> ſo I may ſay, <hi>Be wiſe, O ye people, and obedient all you that are inhabitants of the earth, ſerve the Lord with feare, and rejoyce before him with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, kiſſe the Son</hi> (ſubmit to Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>leſt he be angry,</hi> and give you ſuch Princes and Powers, or put you into ſuch hands as ſhall break and vex you to purpoſe, and make you know what it is to ſerve men in rigour, having refuſed to ſerve God in love. Many in all nations are apt to complaine much, when they have any bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens upon them by Governours, but few complaine of their owne ſins, which cauſe God to burden nations with ſuch Governours; let all leave off complaining of evill Governours, and complaine more of their owne evill government, both of their hearts and lives.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee how this text according to theſe diſtinct tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Firſt, gives warning to Princes, <hi>That the hypocrite reigne not, leſt the people be enſnared;</hi> and, Secondly, gives warning to people, that they provoke not God by their ſcandalous offences, to ſet wicked Princes and Powers over them.</p>

                     <p>Surely it is meete to be ſaid unto God, I have borne chaſtiſement, I will not offend any more.</p>
                     <p>That which I ſee not, teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will doe no more.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ELihu</hi> having convinced <hi>Job,</hi> both of the power of God, to doe what he pleaſeth, and alſo of his righteouſneſſe, that he is juſt in whatſoever he pleaſeth to doe, proceedeth to give him coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, how to carry himſelfe better towards God, then by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſpeeches and expoſtulations (hinted at the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of this Chapter) he ſeemed to have done. In theſe two verſes he gives him (according to our tranſlation) counſell conſiſting of three branches.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He counſells him to a due ſubmiſſion, to the hand of God. In the former part of the 31<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>Surely it is meete to be ſaid unto God, I have borne chaſtiſement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He counſells him to reformation, or to a gracious reſolution of laying downe every ſinfull thing, or what ever was a provocation to God. This he doth once and againe, twice in theſe two verſes; Firſt, in the cloſe of the 31<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>It is meete to be ſayd unto God, I will not offend any more;</hi> Secondly, in the cloſe of the 32d verſe; <hi>If I have done iniquity, I will doe no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Elihu</hi> counſells <hi>Job,</hi> to pray for further diſcoveries, both of his ſins, and ſinfullneſſe, as alſo of his duty, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the 32<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe; <hi>That which I ſee not teach thou me.</hi> Thus you have the diſtinct poynts of that counſell which <hi>Elihu</hi> gives <hi>Job,</hi> according to our reading of theſe words. There is another reading, which I ſhall touch, when I have firſt opened and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the words as they ſtand in ours.</p>

<pb n="788" facs="tcp:104248:405"/> repenting childe, ſpeakes to a diſpleaſed father, when he is under his rod, (yet ſuch as become the moſt aged and growne men in grace) I <hi>have borne chaſtiſement,</hi> I have been under thy correcting hand, forgive me O my father, I will doe ſo no more. Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> adviſeth <hi>Job,</hi> to beſpeak God his father while he was afflicting him.</p>
                  <p>Some render the former part of this verſe, by way of interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or queſtion, <hi>Hath he ſayd unto God, I have borne chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> I <hi>will offend no more?</hi> hath <hi>Job</hi> ſpoken thus to God? As if <hi>Elihu</hi> (making his appeale to the by-ſtanders) had ſayd, <hi>Ye all are witneſſes that Job hath not yet humbled himſelfe under the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting hand of God, but rather charged God with ſeverity, in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, and over-boldly enquired into the reaſon of his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> Our affirmative tranſlation carrieth the ſame ſenſe with this interrogative, and queſtioning tranſlation; for when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith to <hi>Job, It is meete to be ſayd unto God,</hi> I <hi>have borne chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> he ſuppoſeth, that <hi>Job</hi> had not ſayd ſo.</p>

                  <p>Againe, The word <hi>meete,</hi> is not expreſly in the Hebrew text, yet it is clearly implyed in it, and therefore added by our tranſlators to fill up, and cleare the ſenſe; the originall is, <hi>It is to be ſayd unto God,</hi> we ſay, <hi>It is meete to be ſayd unto God,</hi>
                     <q>I have borne chaſtiſement.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word <hi>chaſtiſement</hi> alſo is not expreſly in the original, there it is only, I <hi>have borne,</hi> but becauſe <hi>bearing</hi> muſt needs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that ſomewhat is borne as a burthen, and ſeeing according unto the ſubject matter that <hi>Elihu</hi> is upon with <hi>Job,</hi> it muſt referre to ſome affliction or chaſtiſement laid upon him, therefore we fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupply this word <hi>chaſtiſement, It is to be ſayd unto God,</hi> I <hi>have borne;</hi> what? (it cannot be meant of any outward corporall bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, or viſible loade layd upon his back; but, <hi>I have borne</hi>)
<pb n="789" facs="tcp:104248:405"/> chaſtiſement, affliction, or correction; <hi>It is meete to be ſayd unto God, I have borne chaſtiſement;</hi> that is, I both have and will beare, whatſoever thou haſt, or ſhalt be pleaſed to lay upon me; I will not diſpute thy burthens, but take them up. So then, this firſt part of the verſe is a direction miniſtred to <hi>Job,</hi> ſhewing him how to behave himſelfe in the bearing of affliction; He muſt not ſtrive or ſtruggle with them, nor with God about them, but ſuſtaine them. And this direction is not peculiar to <hi>Job's</hi> perſon, or to his caſe alone, but it belongs to all that are in affliction, let their caſe be what it will; all ſuch ought to beare quietly or patiently to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide under the burthen which God layeth upon them. I ſhall not ſtay upon the opening of the ſpeciall ſignification of that word <hi>chaſtiſement,</hi> becauſe it is not in the Hebrew text, only thus, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements are uſually taken for thoſe afflictions, or afflicting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, which God layeth upon his owne children; he layeth judgements upon the wicked, and puniſhments upon the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but properly, and ſtrictly, that which falls upon his owne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is called <hi>chaſtiſement.</hi> For though in Scripture, there are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of God towards his owne people, ſpoken of under the notion of judgement, yet they have not a proper ſenſe of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as proceeding from wrath, and intended for revenge. Wrath is the ſpring from whence judgements flow, and as to their iſſue, they tend to the ſatisfaction of Juſtice. This God doth not expect, at the hands of his owne children, and therefore their afflictions are moſt properly called chaſtiſements, <hi>Surely it is meete to be ſayd unto God,</hi> I <hi>have borne chaſtiſement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>It is our duty when the hand of God is upon us, or when we are under chaſtiſements, to ſpeake humbly, meekly, and ſubmiſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God.</q>
                  <p>We ought alwayes to be humble, and carry it humbly towards God, but then eſpecially when God by any afflicting providence is humbling us. The Prophet (<hi>Hoſ:</hi> 14.2.) calling that people to returne unto the Lord, adviſeth thus; <hi>Take with you words, and turne to the Lord, ſay unto him, take away all iniquity, and receive us graciouſly, ſo will we render the calves of our lips.</hi> As <hi>Elihu</hi> here makes a kinde of directory, what a perſon in affliction ſhould ſay unto God, <hi>It is meete to ſay unto God,</hi> that is, for a man in thy caſe,
<pb n="790" facs="tcp:104248:406"/> to ſay thus unto God; ſo that Prophet, by the Spirit, ſaith, <hi>Take unto you words, and turne to the Lord,</hi> and ſay or ſpeake thus unto him; though not ſtrictly, ſyllabically, in ſo many words, yet to this ſence, and purpoſe, or according to this tenour, ſpeak thus, <hi>Take away iniquity, and receive us graciouſly.</hi> And when the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Take unto you words,</hi> his meaning is not that they ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectedly ſtudy a forme of words for God, much leſſe that they ſhould artificially counterfeit words which their hearts had not conceived, or were not correſpondent to their hearts, (many ſpeake words, even to God, which never come neare but are meere ſtrangers to the intents of their hearts) but ſincere words, humble words, words of ſupplication, not expoſtulating words, not quarrelling words, not murmuring words, not meere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining words, but take to you words of confeſſion, and ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo preſent your ſelves and your condition before the Lord. The Preacher (<hi>Eccleſ:</hi> 12.10.) <hi>ſought to finde out acceptable words,</hi> and ſo ſhould we when we ſpeake unto men; Preachers of the word ſhould ſeeke to finde out acceptable words; not fine words, not ſwelling words of vanity, not ſlattering ſoothing words, but <hi>acceptable words,</hi> that is, ſuch as may finde eaſie paſſage into the heart; or ſuch words as may make their paſſage into the heart, through the power of the Spirit of God. Now if the Preacher ſought to finde out acceptable words, when he ſpake to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, much more ſhould we when we ſpeak to God. O how ſhould we labour then to finde out acceptable words. All words are not fit to be ſpoken unto God; the words that are (in ſuch caſes as the text ſpeakes of) may be reduced to theſe two heads.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They muſt be <hi>God juſtifying words,</hi> that is, words by which we acquit the Juſtice of God, how ſore, and how heavy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his hand is upon us. When <hi>Daniel</hi> (Chap: 9.7, 14.) was laying before the Lord the calamitous ſtate of that people (they were under as ſore judgements as ever nation was, <hi>For under the whole heavens</hi> (ſaith he there) <hi>hath not been done, as God hath done unto Jeruſalem</hi>) yet all the words he ſpake unto God, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the juſtification of God; <hi>O Lord</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>righteouſneſſe belongeth unto thee, but unto us confuſion of faces, as at this day, to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. We have not had one ſtroake more, then we have deſerved, there hath not been a grain of weight more in our burthen, then we have
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:104248:406"/> brought upon our ſelves, there hath not been a drop in our cup more then we have given juſt cauſe for, <hi>Therefore hath the Lord watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us, for the Lord our God is righteous in all his works, which he doth, for we obeyed not his voice;</hi> theſe are words fit to be ſpoken unto God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We are to take to our ſelves <hi>ſelf-condemning, ſelf-abaſing, ſelf-emptying words.</hi> Such we finde in that chapter, (<hi>v.</hi> 5, 6, 7.) <hi>To us belong ſhame, and confuſion of face,</hi> &amp;c. theſe are the words we ſhould take to our ſelves, and thus it is meet to be ſaid unto God, whenſoever his chaſtiſements are upon us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>It is our duty to acknowledge it to God, that he hath chaſtened us, when he hath.</q>
                  <p>We muſt own his hand in afflicting us, as much as in proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, in caſting us down, as much as in lifting us up, in wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, as much as in healing us; It is meet to be ſaid unto God, we have born chaſtiſement, thy hand hath been upon us. The neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of, or rather obſtinacy againſt this, is charged as a great ſin (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.17.) <hi>Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not ſee;</hi> that is, they will not acknowledge thy moſt eminent appearances in anger againſt them. 'Tis ſo with many at this day, though there be a hand of God (as it were) viſibly afflicting their bodies, and eſtates, their children and families; yet they will not ſee, that it is a hand of God; but ſay as the Philiſtines, <hi>it is a chance,</hi> or, it is our ill fortune; it is from the negligence of this man, or from the malice of that other man. All this while there is no acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the hand of God. They ſay not with <hi>Eli,</hi> (1 Sam. 3.18.) <hi>It is the Lord;</hi> nor with <hi>David,</hi> (Pſal. 39.9, 10.) <hi>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, becauſe thou didſt it; Remove thy ſtroke away from me, I am conſumed by the blow of thine hand. It is as much our duty, and for the glory of God, to confeſs that our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are of God, as our mercies and favours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>The chaſtenings of God muſt be born, they muſt be endured.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Many are chaſtiſed who cannot ſay they have born chaſtiſements;</hi> It's an ordinary thing to be under chaſtiſement, but its a great thing and requires much holy skill and ſpiritualneſs to bear a chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="792" facs="tcp:104248:407"/> the duty of a Chriſtian lies moſt in two points.</p>
                  <p>Firſt in doing, or in active obedience.</p>
                  <p>Secondly in ſuffering, or in paſſive obedience, and there is as much of God, as much of grace, as much of holineſs, yea I may ſay much more held out in bearing and in ſuffering, then there is in acting or in doing.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, what is it <hi>to bear,</hi> that you make it ſo difficult a matter to bear chaſtiſements? How muſt chaſtiſements be born? or what is it to bear them?</p>
                  <p>I will anſwer the queſtion under two heads. Firſt, Negatively, To bear chaſtiſement is not</p>
                  <p>Firſt, meerly to finde or feel it upon our ſhoulders as a burthen which pincheth or preſſeth us; ſo a beaſt may bear.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is not a bearing meerly becauſe we cannot help it, or be rid of our burden, for ſo the worſt of men may bear; they bear the greateſt burthens that God layeth upon them, becauſe they cannot avoid them, nor eaſe themſelves of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is not a bearing ſtoutly, or ſlightingly, to make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it; ſo proud men bear, men of unſubdued ſpirits unto God, and his word, regard not what they bear, nor what God doth to them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is not a bearing them ſowrly or ſullenly; for ſo diſcontented perſons bear; yea, ſo the devil beareth the burthen which the hand of God hath laid upon him.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Nor is it a bearing chaſtiſement faintly or diſpondingly; ſo weak believers bear. <hi>To bear and faint, is not the bearing of faith.</hi> Neither of theſe are the bearing of chaſtiſement which <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihu</hi> intends in this counſel, when he ſaith, <hi>It is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have born chaſtiſment.</hi> Thus ye ſee the Negative, what the bearing of it is not?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer affirmatively, To bear a chaſtiſement as an act or work of grace, is</p>
                  <p>Firſt to bear it <hi>ſenſibly;</hi> that is, feeling the weight of the hand of God, and taſting the bitterneſs of that cup of ſorrow which he giveth us to drink.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, 'Tis a bearing of it ſubmittingly, humbly, patiently, laying our ſelves down at the foot of God, and ſaying, as <hi>Eli</hi> did, <hi>Let him do what ſeemeth him good;</hi> or as <hi>David,</hi> (2 Sam. 15.26.) <hi>Behold, here I am, let him do to me as ſeemeth good unto him.</hi> We
<pb n="793" facs="tcp:104248:407"/> never bear any evil of affliction well, till we can ſay (with a ſweet reſignation of our ſelves) to God, do with us what ſeemeth to thee good. And (for our encouragement I may ſay) nothing can hurt a godly man which ſeemeth good to God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, 'Tis a contentful bearing, or a bearing contentedly; Thus Chriſt ſpake (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. and 'tis cited by the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.) <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will, I am content to do it;</hi> what was that? It was to bear or ſuffer; the greateſt part of what Chriſt was to do, was to bear or ſuffer <hi>the chaſtiſement of our peace,</hi> (Iſa. 53.5.) and in ſuffering to be made a ſacrifice for us; his contentment to do the will of God, was a contentment to ſuffer. Of ſuch a ſpirit ſhould the people of God be; bearing chaſtiſement not only pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, but contentedly; this is hard, but this cannot be left out in the full exerciſe of that grace.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, 'Tis to bear it (more then contentedly) willingly; how free was Chriſt to bear, when he ſaid (<hi>John</hi> 18.11.) <hi>The cup which my father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> Surely I will, I am willing to drink it, though it be a bitter cup. We are not to will our ſufferings, but to ſuffer them willingly; there is a vaſt difference between theſe two; I do not ſay we are to will our ſufferings, but we are to ſuffer them willingly; we muſt ſuffer what, and how, and when, and how long God will; and when God willeth our ſufferings, we muſt ſuffer with our wills, or be willing to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, To bear chaſtiſement in the ſence here intended, is not only to bear it with our will, but with our affections, not only wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, but acceptably, and embracingly; 'tis to ſay <hi>welcome croſs,</hi> becauſe it is the will of God. There is no chaſtiſement that we can rejoyce in, or have any affection to, conſidered in it ſelf, but to bear chaſtiſement in contemplation of the will of God, ſhould work our hearts to an accepting, to an embracing, to a welcoming of it; we ſhould ſay to all our ſufferings, welcome, by the will of God.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, 'Tis to bear it prayerfully; we muſt bear ſilently in oppoſition to complaining; but we muſt not bear ſilently in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to praying. While chaſtiſement is upon our backs, ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations muſt be in our mouths; and we muſt pray, firſt, That we may ſee the reaſon why or for what cauſe God chaſteneth us: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, We muſt pray, that we may anſwer the ends which God
<pb n="794" facs="tcp:104248:408"/> aimeth at in chaſtening us. Thirdly, That we may have freſh power to bear his chaſtenings. Fourthly, That God would be pleaſed to remove our chaſtenings. While we bear chaſtenings, we may pray, and pray hard that God would take them away. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had no ſooner ſaid, <hi>I opened not my mouth,</hi> (that is, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly) <hi>becauſe thou didst it</hi> (Pſal. 39.9.) but preſently he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his mouth in prayer (<hi>verſ.</hi> 10.) <hi>Remove thy ſtroke away from me.</hi> While we bear our croſs patiently and willingly, it would be our ſin not to pray for deliverance from it. To ſay I am under a chaſtiſement, and let the Lord keep it upon me as long as he will, I will never ask him to take it off, were a moſt unbecoming frame of ſpirit. They that bear affliction moſt cheerfully, ſhould pray moſt earneſtly to be eaſed of it; we muſt be willing to bear them alwayes, yet we muſt pray that we may not bear them long. If a childe under the rod of a parent, ſhould not ſay, <hi>pray father ſtay your hand, it is enough,</hi> but let him go on ſtriking, and never inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate a deſire of his forbearance, this were a ſigne of ſtubbornneſs, not of patience and ſubmiſſion. 'Tis as bad not to ask releaſe from our troubles, as to murmure at them, or to be unquiet under them. Remember then, you muſt be as much in the exerciſe of prayer as of patience under the croſs, and that in theſe four re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. Thus you have the anſwer to that queſtion; by which it appears, that 'tis no eaſie matter to ſay what <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have born chaſtiſement?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is yet another queſtion, (for ſome may demand) why ſhould chaſtiſements be thus born? I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We muſt bear them according to all the rules before given, becauſe they come from God. Our afflictions are Gods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotment, we muſt bear what he appoints: therefore old <hi>Eli,</hi> though he had failed, and ſinned greatly, and ſo brought a cloud of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity upon himſelf and his family (the very report whereof, as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> told him, would make both ears of every one that heard it, to tingle) yet he compoſed his ſpirit to a ſubmiſſive hearing of it, upon this ſingle conſideration, <hi>It is the Lord,</hi> and there is enough in that conſideration to make all men ſubmit. For firſt, The Lord is ſupream, and therefore what he doth muſt be born. Secondly, He is <hi>a Father,</hi> a childe muſt bear what a Father layeth upon him; and as the Lord is a father, ſo he is not a haſty, imprudent, or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate father, but a moſt wiſe and judicious father; therefore 'tis
<pb n="795" facs="tcp:104248:408"/> our intereſt as well as our duty to bear his chaſtiſements. Yea, he is a gracious, tender, and compaſſionate father, and when we know he that layeth a hand of affliction upon us, hath alſo a heart full of compaſſion towards us, we ſhould willingly bear his hand.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chaſtiſements are to be born in the manner directed, becauſe they are for our good, and ſhall we not bear what is good for us? <hi>It is good for me</hi> (ſaid <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.71.) <hi>that I have been afflicted;</hi> and ſo the Apoſtle (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10.) <hi>For they verily for a few dayes, chaſtened us after their own pleaſure, but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holineſs.</hi> Chaſtiſements are for our profit, and ſhall not we bear that which is for our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit? If God ſhould lay chaſtiſements on us for our hurt, meerly to vex us, &amp; to put us to pain, or meerly becauſe he delights in our ſufferings, who could bear them? But it is meet to bear what God layes upon us, becauſe he doth it for our good and profit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We muſt bear chaſtiſements in the manner ſhewed, becauſe unleſs we bear them ſo, they will do us no good, or we ſhall have no profit by them, and that's a miſery indeed. To bear ſmart, and finde no advantage coming in by it; to drink gall, and to have no ſweetneſs come out of it; to endure loſs, and to have no kinde of profit by it is very grievous. Now what ever chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is laid upon any, it doth them no good, and they can have no profit by it, unleſs they bear it as was before deſcribed; it is not the bare being afflicted, that doth us good, but it is the wiſe management, or the skilful bearing of it that doth us good; and therefore we finde, that the Apoſtle (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.11.) when he had ſaid, <hi>There is no affliction joyous for the preſent, but grievous,</hi> adds, <hi>Nevertheleſs afterwards it yeildeth the peaceable fruit of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> (but to whom? What to every one that is afflicted, have they theſe ſweet fruits? No, but) <hi>to them that are exerciſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</hi> Afflictions bring no ſweet fruits to them that have them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be exerciſed by them: how exerciſed? Afflictions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe every one that hath them; they are to all a paſſive exerciſe, but to be exerciſed, notes here an active exerciſe; they who gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly exerciſe themſelves in affliction, ſhall without doubt finde benefit and fruit by affliction.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, what is it to be thus exerciſed by affliction? I anſwer (for the opening of that Scripture) to be exerciſed, is,</p>
                  <pb n="796" facs="tcp:104248:409"/>
                  <p>Firſt, To be much in ſearching our own hearts, and wayes, or how 'tis with us, and what hath been done by us, (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.14.) <hi>In the day of adverſity conſider,</hi> that is, bethink your ſelves, Firſt, What God is doing. Secondly, What you have been doing. Thirdly, What becomes you to do in ſuch a day. The prophet points us to the two latter Duties of ſuch a day in one verſe, (<hi>Lam.</hi> 3.40.) <hi>Let us ſearch and try our wayes, and turn again to the Lord. To ſearch our wayes,</hi> is to conſider what we have been doing; <hi>to turn to the Lord,</hi> is the great thing to be done, in a day of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As this exerciſe of the ſoul conſiſts in ſearching our own hearts; ſo in ſearching the heart of God (if I may ſo ſpeak) that is, in an humble enquiry to the utmoſt, what God meaneth by any affliction, what hath moved him to afflict us; and we have as much cauſe to ſearch Gods heart, as our own in this caſe. Thus in that National affliction (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1.) when the famine conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued three years, year after year, it is ſaid, <hi>David enquired of the Lord, why is it thus?</hi> he ſearch'd Gods heart by deſiring an anſwer from the Lord, what ſin it was which provoked him to that ſad diſpenſation. And thus we ſhould be enquiring of God by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er what ſin he ſtriketh at, or what grace he ſpecially calleth us to act by any affliction which he ſendeth either upon our families or perſons.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is an exerciſing of our ſelves in ſearching the affliction it ſelf; firſt, into the nature of it. Secondly, into the circumſtances of it, how timed, and meaſured, by what hand, and in what way the Lord deals with us; this is a great exerciſe, and unleſs we are thus exerciſed under affliction, we get ſmart, and loſs, and bitterneſs, but no good at all by it. So much for the firſt counſel given <hi>Job</hi> by <hi>Elihu, It is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have born chaſtiſement.</hi>
                  </p>

Every offence or ſin, ſprings from the corruption of our own hearts, and is a corruption of our wayes and manners. Both theſe readings, <hi>I will not offend,</hi> or, <hi>I will not corrupt,</hi> meet in the ſame ſence; for to corrupt our wayes is to offend, and to offend is to corrupt our wayes; to do any evil is to corrupt our ſelves, or others.

It was the brand of <hi>Ahaz</hi> (2 Chron. 28.22.) <hi>in the time of his diſtreſs, he treſpaſſed yet more againſt the Lord;</hi> whereas being in diſtreſs, he ſhould have ſaid to the Lord, I <hi>will treſpaſs no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note ſecondly.</p>
                  <q>When God chaſtens us, we ſhould promiſe amendment.</q>
                  <p>We ſhould tel God, we will him offend no more, we wil grieve him no more, we will provoke him no more, we will diſhonour him no more; the leaſt ſin once committed is too much, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould engage to ſin no more.</p>

                     </gap>omiſe, or take ſuch an engagement upon himſelf, when under chaſtiſement, that he will offend no more? Is that degree of perfection attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this life, to offend no more? How then is this <hi>meet to be
<pb n="798" facs="tcp:104248:410"/> ſaid unto God,</hi> I <hi>will offend no more?</hi> Muſt we promiſe things that we cannot perform?

I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by way of conceſſion. No man may promiſe, what ever his chaſtiſements are, that he never will ſin at all any more, no man can make any ſuch promiſe, neither is that the meaning here; but he that is under the chaſtening hand of God, may and muſt, promiſe that he will not commit ſuch, or ſuch a ſin any more; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially not ſuch a ſin as he moſt ſuſpects to have brought the chaſtiſement upon his back; we may make promiſes againſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſins, though we cannot promiſe we will never ſin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may promiſe, when we are under the chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand of God, that we will offend no more, in ſuch a manner as we have offended formerly, ſo fooliſhly, ſo vainly, ſo negligently; we may and muſt promiſe to be more watchful, that we ſin not the ſame ſin again either for matter or manner.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When chaſtened, we may ſay unto God abſolutely, we will offend no more, with reſpect to the purpoſe of our ſouls; that is, we muſt lay aſide all purpoſes of committing any ſin; yea we may, we muſt tell the Lord, 'tis the deſire and purpoſe of our ſouls, 'tis our ayme, and ſhall be our endeavour to offend no more. The ayme of every true believer is not to ſin, though (in this world) it be not the attainment of any (1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1.) <hi>My little children, theſe things write I unto you, that ye ſin not:</hi> As if the Apoſtle had ſaid, I would fain wynde up your hearts to ſuch a pitch, that you may not ſin at all; <hi>But if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father;</hi> I know you cannot but ſin, yet let it be your care not to ſin, and your prayer to offend no more. And how ſhould we bleſs the Lord, if we could live without ſin, and be for ever rid of it! we ſhould wiſh a thouſand times more to be quit of ſin, then affliction; thus we muſt ſay unto God, we will offend no more.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, though we cannot promiſe, or take up ſuch a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion abſolutely, nor in our own ſtrength, yet we may and ought in the ſtrength of Chriſt, or to the utmoſt of that ſtrength and grace, which he gives out, and beſtoweth upon us.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak further to this poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, from thoſe
<pb n="799" facs="tcp:104248:410"/> words of the 32d or next verſe, (which are of neer alliance both as to matter and form with theſe here) <hi>If I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Only before I paſs from this rendering of the Text in hand, take two Notes more; In that <hi>Elihu</hi> telleth the penitent perſon, he ought to ſay unto God, <hi>I will not offend any more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, Firſt.</p>
                  <q>A truly humbled and repenting ſoul, is as careful to avoid the act of ſin for the time to come, as to be freed from the guilt of ſin paſt.</q>
                  <p>This holy care is a ſure argument of a good conſcience. A wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wretch may be deſirous to have former offences pardoned, but he hath not any unfeigned purpoſe not to offend any more; and uſually he hath no ſooner caſt up his ſin by a ſeeming penitent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but he returns with the dog to his vomit by a freſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his ſin. Sorrow for ſin yeilds no comfort, if not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a care not to ſin. Chriſt was not ſo rigid to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man taken in Adultery as her accuſers were, yet he ſaith to her, (<hi>John</hi> 8.11.) <hi>Go and ſin no more;</hi> as if he had ſaid, thy caſe will be ſad, though now thou haſt eſcaped or got rid of thy accuſers, it thou tradeſt on in this wicked way. And when <hi>David</hi> prayed for purging the ſin paſt, he alſo prayed for eſtabliſhing by the free Spirit of God, againſt ſuch-like temptations in time to come, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.) as if he had ſaid, Lord, I do not ask pardon that I might take liberty to offend again, but I deſire thy confirming and preventing grace, that I may offend no more.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the extenſiveneſs of this engagement, to which <hi>Elihu</hi> directs the penitent perſon, <hi>I will not offend any more,</hi> neither in one kinde nor other.</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>He that is truly humbled for any one ſin, will to his utmoſt avoid every ſin.</q>
                  <p>He ſaith, I will not offend any more. He that loves God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live in the doing of any one thing which God hates; but as he expects good out of all the promiſes, ſo he hath reſpect to all the commandments; whoſoever hath ſo, would not offend in any thing any more.</p>
                  <pb n="800" facs="tcp:104248:411"/>
                  <p>Further, as this latter clauſe is tranſlated, I <hi>will corrupt no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Sin is a corruption.</q>
                  <p>We ſhall do well to look upon ſin in all its notions, to make it loathſom to us; this is one notion of it, ſin corrupts every thing and perſon it hath to do with.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Sin is the corruption of our nature, the whole maſs of mankinde, and the whole of every man is leavened by it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Sin is the corruption of our converſation, and of our way, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.11, 12.) <hi>God looked upon the earth, and behold it was corrupt, for all fleſh had corrupted his way upon the earth. Moſes</hi> warns the people of Iſrael againſt ſin upon this ground, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 4.16.) <hi>Leſt ye corrupt your ſelves, and make you a graven image,</hi> read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 53.1. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.9. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.7.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Sinning is the corrupting of the Commandments of God, a ſinner as much as in him lyeth makes void the Law.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Sinning is a corrupting of the Covenant of God; yea ſome kinde of ſinning is a corrupting the blood of the Covenant, or a counting the blood of the Covenant as an unholy thing (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29.) though the blood of the Covenant be in it ſelf infinitely above all corruption, yet ſin doth what it can to corrupt it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Some render, <hi>it is meet to be ſaid unto God,</hi> I <hi>have born chaſtiſement,</hi> I <hi>will not break;</hi> which we may underſtand two ways. Firſt,<note place="margin">Ideo ad Deum dici debet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fero, non diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumpam. <hi>Bez.</hi>
                     </note> I <hi>will not again break</hi> the Commandment; ſo it falls in with our Tranſlation, I <hi>will not offend.</hi> Secondly, I <hi>will not break;</hi> that is, thoſe rods, or bonds of chaſtiſement that thou haſt laid upon me; as if he ſhould ſay, Lord, thou haſt bound me in theſe fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of affliction, and I will abide thy pleaſure under them, I will not ſtrive, but ſubmit, I will not break priſon, but wait thy time for my deliverance.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>We must bear, not break the bonds of our affliction.</q>
                  <p>Some (like ſtubborn children under the chaſtening hand of a Parent) would even break away from God; or like malefactors, when under the hand of Juſtice, they would break priſon, knock off their irons, and get away. As the wicked do, and ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the bands and cords of Gods Commandments, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.3.)
<pb n="801" facs="tcp:104248:411"/> 
                     <hi>Let us breake their bands aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us;</hi> ſo ſome ſpeake and doe about the bands and cords of divine chaſtiſements, they will breake from them, or breake them, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly they can. Let ſuch remember, 'tis beſt when they are in Gods bands, to let him untie them, and when they are in his priſon, 'tis good to abide there, till he is pleaſed to diſcharge and let them out. The Apoſtles being in priſon, the Magiſtrates ſent the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants, ſaying, <hi>Let theſe men goe,</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> ſayd unto them, <hi>they have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romanes, and have caſt us into priſon, and now doe they thruſt us out privily, nay verily, but let them come themſelves and fetch us out.</hi> A godly man when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reſtraint by the illegal or rigorous dealings of the Magiſtrate, will not accept his liberty, upon unworthy termes; ſurely then he will not make an eſcape out of the hand of God unwarrantably. He is ready to accept his liberty with much thankfullneſſe, but he will not force it with violence. A godly man would free himſelfe from ſin, and get heaven by a kind of force (as Chriſt ſpeakes in the Goſpel) but he would not free himſelfe from ſuffering by force, nor get his eaſe by violence. When God bindes him, he ſaith (according to this reading) I <hi>will not breake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, who may be ſayd to breake or get by force out of the chaſtning hand of God?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; Firſt, they doe it, by way of interpretation, who are impatient and unquiet in their afflictions. A child that ſtrives and ſtruggles under his fathers rod, breakes away from him as much as he can.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They actually breake from under the hand of God, who by any ſinfull way helpe themſelves out of their afflictions. Such, when God hath bound them with the cords of affliction, goe to the Devill to looſe &amp; let them out. 'Tis ſad when God impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons a man, But O how ſad is it to go to the Devill for a releaſe; yet ſo doe all they who being under affliction, endeavour to free themſelves by any ſinful way; eſpecially when they who are perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for the ſaith &amp; truth of Chriſt, break their faith with Chriſt, and quit the truth before profeſſed, that they may quit themſelves from perſecution. O take heed of ſuch deliverances, rather dye under the afflicting hand of God, or the perſecuring hand of man, then free your ſelves from either by putting your hand or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your mouth to ſin. Better be utterly broken by affliction, then
<pb n="802" facs="tcp:104248:412"/> ſo to breake the bands of affliction; better dye in affliction, then ſin your ſelves out of affliction. Let God who ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Mr <hi>Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> is expreſs for this tranſlation, rendring the text in theſe words; <hi>Now unto the omnipotent which ſaith,</hi> I <hi>pardon,</hi> I <hi>will not deſtroy, this ſhall be ſaid, what</hi> I <hi>ſee not teach thou me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>As the words according to our tranſlation containe an humble and a very gracious acknowledgement of the Chaſtening hand of God, and mans promiſe of reformation; ſo according to this they containe a moſt precious deſcription of the moſt gracious diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of God, ſpeaking two things of himſelfe to man.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As pardoning.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As not deſtroying. From this double diſcovery of God, a double duty is inferr'd, incumbent upon man. For God having thus declared himſelfe ready to forgive ſin, and loth to deſtroy ſinners, every ſinner ſhould be induced to ſay thus to God; I <hi>ſee many of my ſins, and</hi> I <hi>believe</hi> I <hi>have many ſins more which</hi> I <hi>ſee not; therefore, firſt,</hi> I <hi>beg of thee, O God, that thou wouldeſt ſhew me what</hi> I <hi>ſee not, and, ſecondly, that thou wouldeſt keep me for ever from doing or committing againe that evill which thou ſhalt ſhew me or cauſe me to ſee.</hi> Thus the 32<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:104248:412"/> of a two-fold duty in man, upon that two-fold manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the goodneſſe of God, as a God that willingly pardoneth ſin, and as a God that is unwilling to deſtroy ſinners.</p>
                  <p>Or we may give the ſumme of theſe two verſes (according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſecond tranſlation) thus;<note place="margin">

                        </list>
                     </note> We have firſt an Exhortation to repentance from the moſt mercifull nature of God, both as ready to forgive, and as loth to deſtroy his creatures. The former act importing the taking away of the guilt of ſin; the latter the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittal and removall of the puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have here a direction about repentance, or to the penitent, ſhewing, how an humbled ſoule ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelfe toward God; He ought to ſay thus; <hi>What I ſee not teach thou me, and if I have done iniquity, I will doe no more.</hi> Where we ſee the humbled ſoule in the exerciſe of a fourefold duty; Firſt, He confeſſeth what ſins he knoweth; Secondly, He confeſſeth or ſuppoſeth, that he hath many ſins which he doth not know. Thirdly, He entreateth the Lord to ſhew him every ſin, whether of heart or life, which he knoweth not of. Fourthly, He engageth that he will not continue in any ſin which the Lord ſhall diſcover to him, or give him the knowledge of.

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>To bear,</hi> in which ſenſe we tranſlate, I <hi>have born cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement.</hi>
                     <pb n="804" facs="tcp:104248:413"/> The word <hi>chaſtiſement,</hi> as was ſhewed before, is not expreſly in the text, but ſupplyed, to make out the ſenſe, by our tranſlaters: I <hi>have born,</hi> what? thy hand, thy chaſtiſement.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It ſignifies alſo <hi>to pardon,</hi> or <hi>to forgive;</hi> I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre you to one Scripture, in which that word is uſed in both theſe ſenſes (<hi>Gen:</hi> 4.13.) <hi>And Cain ſaid unto the Lord, my puniſhment is greater then</hi> I <hi>can bear;</hi> that's the text, but if you read the margin of our larger Bibles, that ſaith, <hi>My iniquity is greater then that it may be forgiven, or pardoned;</hi> the text ſaith, <hi>my puniſhment;</hi> the margin ſaith, <hi>my iniquity;</hi> the ſame word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth both ſin the cauſe, and puniſhment the fruit. Againe, there the text ſaith, <hi>My puniſhment is greater then</hi> I <hi>can bear;</hi> and the margin ſaith, <hi>my iniquity is greater then that it can be forgiven:</hi> So that according to the text, the words are <hi>Cains</hi> complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the juſtice of God; that he dealt over-rigorouſly with him, <hi>My puniſhment is greater then</hi> I <hi>can bear.</hi> And according to the margin, they are a deſcription of his deſpair of the mercy of God, <hi>my ſin is greater then that it may be forgiven.</hi> And as we find the word uſed in that place, both for bearing, and for pardoning; So in ſeverall other places it is tranſlated by pardoning; take but one Inſtance in the Pſalms, where we find it tranſlated twice in the ſpace of a few verſes to forgive or pardon (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 32.1.) <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe iniquity is forgiven.</hi> And againe, <hi>v.</hi> 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, I <hi>ſaid</hi> I <hi>will confeſſe my iniquity, and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin;</hi> So that, though there be a different verſion and tranſlation of the word in this text of Scripture, yet it is ſuch as is conſonant to the uſe of the word in other Scriptures, and alſo to the truth of the whole Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Yea, we know that in our Engliſh tongue, to <hi>bear with a man,</hi> ſignifies to forgive him his preſent fault, or not to puniſh him and uſe extremity againſt him for it. And therefore according to the exigence of any place, the word may be tranſlated either way, and here it may be ſafely taken in both.</p>
                  <q>But to God who ſaith, <hi>I</hi> forgive, <hi>I</hi> will not deſtroy, it ought (or it is meete) to be ſaid, what <hi>I</hi> ſee not teach thou me.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> according to the reading now before us, brings in God thus ſpeaking, yea even boaſting thus of himſelfe, I <hi>forgive, or</hi> I <hi>pardon.</hi>

                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt;</hi> It is Gods owne profeſſion of his owne ſelfe, that he is a ſin-pardoning God.</q>
                  <p>And God doth ſo much ſay or profeſſe this of himſelfe, that when he was entreated by <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſhew him his glory, this was the chiefe thing which he ſayd of himſelfe (<hi>Exod:</hi> 34.6, 7.) <hi>And the Lord paſſed before him, and proclaimed the Lord, the Lord God mercifull and gracious, long-ſuffering and abundant in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin.</hi> Here's my name (ſaith God) if you would know how I am called, or what I would call my ſelfe, this is it, <hi>I am a God forgiving iniquity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And as God pardoneth ſin, ſo there is none in heaven or in earth that pardoneth like him, that hath ſuch a name for pardon as God hath (<hi>Mic:</hi> 7.18.) <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. The gods of the Earth, that is, Kings and Princes give pardons, and to doe ſo is the ſweeteſt and choyceſt flower in the Crowne of Princes, and they uſually ſhew their Greatneſs by this act of grace when they come firſt to their Crowne and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their ſoveraigne power. The Princes or gods of the Earth can pardon, but ('tis no diſparagement to put that queſtion) <hi>Can they pardon like God?</hi> no; their pardon is no pardon in compariſon of Gods pardon; yea their pardoning is a kinde of condemning compared with the pardoning grace of God. The pardons which Kings give are but the ſhadow of his pardon, who is King of kings (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 43.25.) I, <hi>even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I am he, and there is none elſe; this glory is proper to me, and none can partake with me in it, nor will I give this glory to another. All ſins are committed againſt God, and (in a ſenſe) againſt him only, therefore only to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by him. Who can remit the debt but the Creditor? (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 51.1.) <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have</hi> I <hi>ſinned.</hi> What debt ſoever we run into by any ſin committed againſt man, God only is the Creditor. All that men can doe, is but to forgive the treſpaſſe againſt themſelves; ſo farre as man is wronged, he may, yea he ought to forgive, as Chriſt teacheth us to pray (<hi>Math:</hi> 6.12.) <hi>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</hi> All that we can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give is only the treſpaſs done to our ſelves, and ſo forbeare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
<pb n="806" facs="tcp:104248:414"/> and private revenge. We cannot forgive the offence againſt God. For when Chriſt ſaith (<hi>John</hi> 21.20.) <hi>Whoſoever ſins ye remit, they are remitted;</hi> that remiſſion is but the declaring of a pardon, it is not the beſtowing of a pardon, or it is only a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial forgiveneſſe, not an authoritative forgiveneſſe; ſo to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give is Gods Royalty; He ſaith, I <hi>forgive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To God who ſaith,</hi> I <hi>forgive,</hi> &amp;c. Forgive! what? forgive! whom? Here's neither what nor whom, neither things nor perſons named, God barely ſaith, I <hi>forgive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>The pardoning mercy of God is boundleſſe and unlimited.</q>
                  <p>Here's no ſin named, therefore all are included, no ſinner ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, therefore all are intended. I <hi>forgive,</hi> I <hi>pardon;</hi> the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning mercy of God knows no limits; it is not limitted; Firſt, to any ſort of ſins or ſinners; Secondly, it is not limited to any degree of ſins or ſinners; let ſins or ſinners be of what ſort they will, let ſins or ſinners be of what degree they will, they are within the compaſſe of Gods pardoning mercy. And as this text intimates, that the pardoning mercy of God is boundleſſe, becauſe it expreſſeth no bounds; So other Scriptures tell us expreſly that it is boundleſſe, extending it ſelfe to all ſorts and degrees of ſins and ſinners (<hi>Math:</hi> 12.31.) <hi>Every ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven.</hi> That a ſin is great, that it is extremely aggravated, is no barre at all to the pardoning mercy of God; he can as eaſily pardon great ſins as little ſins; even ſins that are as Crimſon and ſcarlet, as well as thoſe of the lighteſt tincture. The die or colour of ſome cloaths or ſtuffs, is ſo fading, that (as we ſay) the next wind will blow it off, or cauſe it to dye away, but ſcarlet and crimſon in graine never change their colour; yet the pardoning grace of God cauſeth crimſon and ſcarlet ſin; to change colour, and makes them as white as the naturall wool or ſnow, that is, takes them quite and cleane away. Yea the greatneſſe of ſin is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtop to pardon, that it is uſed asan argument to move God to pardon. <hi>David</hi> prayeth (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 25.11.) <hi>For thy names ſake O Lord, pardon mine iniquity;</hi> why? doth he ſay? becauſe it is little, or only a ſmall ſin, a ſin committed raſhly, unadviſedly, or but once; no; he uſeth none of theſe excuſatory pleas for pardon, but ſaith, <hi>pardon my ſin for it is great. Moſes</hi> was not afraid to
<pb n="807" facs="tcp:104248:414"/> ſpeake for pardon upon this ground alſo (<hi>Exod:</hi> 32.31.) <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this people have committed a great ſin, and have made them gods of gold, yet now if thou wilt forgive their ſin,</hi> &amp;c. There's a great deale of divine Rhetorique in that ſpeech; <hi>Moſes</hi> was not doubtfull, whether God would forgive them their ſin, becauſe it was great, but he urged the Lord to forgive their ſin becauſe it was great. <hi>Where ſin aboundeth, Grace doth much more abound (Rom:</hi> 5.20.) and therefore God is ſaid <hi>to pardon abundantly,</hi> or to multiply to pardon (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 55.7.) and whom doth he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to pardon there? even <hi>the man of iniquity,</hi> ſo that Scripture hath it; <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man (or the man of iniquity) his thoughts,</hi> &amp;c. If you who have ſinned abundantly, repent, I will pardon abundantly. The heart of God in pardoning ſin is infinitely larger then the heart of man can be in committing ſin: and as the leaſt ſin needs pardon, ſo the greateſt may have it; nothing hinders the pardon of ſin, but the ſinners not coming for it, or his not asking it. The ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt cannot be forgiven; but the reaſon is, becauſe ſuch as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that ſin utterly reject the grace of God, and tread the blood of the Covenant under their feet, as an unholy thing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The text ſpeakes in the preſent tenſe; God ſaith not, I <hi>will pardon,</hi> or, poſſibly, I <hi>may pardon,</hi> but ſheweth what he both actually doth, and what he alwayes doth, <hi>To God who ſaith I pardon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>God pardoneth preſently, he pardoneth continually.</q>
                  <p>I <hi>pardon,</hi> is a preſent, it is a continued act. To pardon is Gods work to day, and Gods work to morrow. As every ſoule may ſay of himſelfe, <hi>Lord</hi> I <hi>ſin;</hi> not only I have ſinned, or I ſhall ſin here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, but <hi>I ſin:</hi> ſo ſaith God, <hi>I pardon;</hi> as men ſtand alwayes in need of pardon, ſo God ſtands alwayes prepared to pardon. <hi>He is</hi> (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 86.5.) <hi>plenteous in mercy, ready to forgive;</hi> The heart of God is never out of frame for that wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ke, never indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to it. <hi>David</hi> found him ſo (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 32.5.) <hi>I ſaid</hi> I <hi>will confeſſe mine iniquity;</hi> he did not ſay, <hi>I have confeſſed mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi> he was not come to a formall Confeſſion; onely he had it upon his heart to humble himſelfe before God, and confeſſe his ſin; yet it follows; <hi>and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin.</hi>
                     <pb n="808" facs="tcp:104248:415"/> While there was but a holy reſolve upon his heart to confeſſe his ſin, the pardon of it was given him. The holy hiſtory of his ſin and of Gods mercy aſſureth us, that the word was no ſooner out of his mouth (2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 12.13.) <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> but inſtantly <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath put away thy ſin.</hi> Though God doth not pardon of courſe, yet he is in a continuall courſe of pardon; therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed (<hi>Numb:</hi> 14.19.) That God would <hi>pardon the people according to the greatneſs of his mercy, and as he had forgiven them from Egypt untill then.</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>Lord, thou haſt been pardoning all along from the very firſt ſtep we took out of Egypt to this day, thou haſt exerciſed abundance of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, long-ſuffering and mercy in pardoning this people, now Lord pardon us, as thou haſt done from Egypt to this day; doe not ſtop thy acts of Grace.</hi> The very firſt act of pardon ſtands for ever, he that is once pardon'd, is alwayes pardon'd: yet there are day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renewings of pardon, and freſh acts of it every day.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The word render'd <hi>to pardon,</hi> ſignifies <hi>to take away;</hi> as to beare a burden upon our ſelves (according to the former tranſlation) ſo to beare, or lift it off from another.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>Pardon is the taking away, or the bearing of ſin off from us.</q>
                  <p>An unpardoned ſoul hath a burden of ſin upon him ready to break his back, yea enough to break his heart, were he ſenſible of it; the Lord by pardon takes this burden off from him. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of his ſins under this notion of a burden, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.4.) <hi>My ſins are gone over my head, they are a burden too heavie for me to bear.</hi> Yea ſin is a burden too heavie for the ſtrongeſt Angel in heaven to bear. But pardon eaſeth the ſoul of that burden, or 'tis the unburdening of the ſoul: Hence alſo pardon is called <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of ſin,</hi> (Pſal. 103.12.) <hi>Thou removeſt our ſins from us, as far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt.</hi> Pardon removes ſin even to the utmoſt diſtance, ſuch is that of the Eaſt from the Weſt. Pardon is called in another Scripture, the caſting of ſin behinde Gods back (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.17.) <hi>Thou haſt caſt all my ſins behinde thy back.</hi> Ye when God by pardon takes ſin from off our backs, he doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt it behinde his owne back, but he layeth it upon the back of his Son. Sin muſt lye ſomwhere till it is ſatisfied for; therefore pardon takes ſin off from us, and layeth it upon Chriſt, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.
<pb n="809" facs="tcp:104248:415"/> 6.) <hi>He hath laid on him the iniquities of us all.</hi> While ſin is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned, we bear it; and that it might be pardoned, Chriſt hath born it, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24.) <hi>He bare our ſins in his body on the tree.</hi> Pardoned ſin is taken off from the ſinner, and laid upon Chriſt; and he can do well enough with it, he can bear it, and diſcharge it fully, none elſe can: Indeed heaps of ſin lye on the ſouls of ſome ſinners, and they feel them no more then a fly: what's the reaſon of it? Becauſe they are dead in their ſins, and nothing is a burden to a dead man, throw a thouſand Milſtones upon him, he feels none of them: but a ſoul that is awakened, that hath but ſo much life put into it, as to feel a conviction of ſin, O how is that ſoul preſt and burden'd with the weight of ſin! Yet till par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don take ſin off from the ſoul, there it muſt lye, there it muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide; therefore Chriſt ſaith, (<hi>John</hi> 9.41.) <hi>Becauſe ye ſay ye ſee, your ſin remains;</hi> What's that? You are unpardoned, your ſin is upon you ſtill; you think your ſelves very wiſe and underſtanding, you think you can do well enough without me, therefore your ſin remaineth; that is, it ſtands in full power and force againſt you.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Here are no conditions; God ſaith not, I pardon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch and ſuch terms, but <hi>I pardon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>God pardons freely, he doth not clog pardon with hard terms.</q>
                  <p>'Tis the glory of God that he pardons freely. The pardon of ſin may be conſidered, Firſt, In the Decree of God from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. Secondly, In the Execution of his Decree; which is, when any are effectually called and converted. Thirdly, As to the manifeſtation and Declaration of it to the perſon pardoned. A poor ſinner may be unpardoned in his own ſence, or in the Court of Conſcience, when he is pardoned in the Court of Heaven. Now as pardon is free in the Decree of it, ſo in the Execution of it, as alſo in the Declaration of it to the ſoul; for though ſomthing, yea much muſt be done in the ſoul before pardon is declared, yet nothing is deſerved, all is of free grace. God doth not manifeſt pardon till man repents and believes; yet he doth not pardon him becauſe he repents and believes.</p>
                  <p>It may be objected, Surely there is ſomthing in us which moves God to pardon, for ſaith not Chriſt of <hi>Mary</hi> (Luke 7.47.) <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſins are forgiven her, for ſhe loved much.</hi> Hence Papiſts argue,
<pb n="810" facs="tcp:104248:416"/> that, pardon of ſin is from ſomthing in us, ſhe repented much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved much, loved much, therefore much was forgiven her?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That Scripture declares her great love to be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of great pardoning mercy, not the cauſe of it. Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Peter,</hi> much is forgiven her; this woman was a noted ſinner, and it appears plainly, that much hath been forgiven her, for ſhe loved much. That her many ſins are forgiven her, this is the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, <hi>ſhe loved much:</hi> The love of God to us, not our love to him, is the reaſon and original of pardon, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25.) <hi>I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for my own ſake.</hi> God pardoneth ſin for his own ſake, and for Chriſts ſake, not for ours. In one Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture God ſaith (<hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7.) <hi>I will by no means clear the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> In another (<hi>John</hi> 6.37.) Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that comes to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Till the ſinner cometh to Chriſt, his ſins are upon his own account; that is, he ſtands guilty, and God ſaith, <hi>I will by no means clear the guilty;</hi> no man ſhall ever be clear'd of the puniſhment due to his ſin, while the guilt of his ſin is untaken off by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt: but beſides reſpect to the blood of Chriſt (which is the ranſome paid for us) God reſpects nothing out of himſelf as the reaſon why he pardoneth us. I <hi>forgive.</hi>

There are many Law-givers that are neither able to ſave nor to deſtroy; or if they be able to deſtroy, they are not able to ſave. Men in authority, or worldly Powers, have not power alwayes to act their authority, but there is one Law-giver that's able to ſave and to deſtroy; he can ſave thoſe that obey his Lawes, and deſtroy all thoſe that tranſgreſs them; he is too ſtrong for the ſtrongeſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, there is no making peace with him by oppoſing or overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſtrength, <hi>but by taking hold of his ſtrength,</hi> that is, by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to it, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.5.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly Note.</p>
                  <q>To forgive ſin, or to ſhew mercy to ſinners, is an act to which God declares himſelf more enclin'd, or better pleaſed with, then to deſtroy ſinners.</q>
                  <p>Every one that ſinneth deſerves to be deſtroyed; yet ſaith the Lord, <hi>I pardon, I will not deſtroy;</hi> I could deſtroy, and any one ſin committed by any man would juſtifie me againſt all the world in his deſtruction: <hi>Every mouth muſt be ſtopped, and all the world become guilty before God</hi> upon that account, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19.) yet God doth not deſtroy. And that he hath no content in deſtroying, he bindes it with an Oath (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11.) <hi>As</hi> I <hi>live ſaith the Lord,</hi> I <hi>have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked,</hi> &amp;c. as if he had ſaid, I am not bent upon your deſtruction, I had rather be taken off, and ſave you, I <hi>pardon,</hi> I <hi>will not deſtroy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any ſhall ſay, Hath God no pleaſure in deſtruction? Hath he not a will to deſtroy as well as to ſave?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, God hath pleaſure in deſtroying, but it is in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of thoſe who obſtinately reſiſt his Will, who refuſe both his counſel and his Covenant; to ſuch indeed he ſaith (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26.) <hi>I will laugh at your calamity, and mock when your fear</hi> (that is, the thing you feared) <hi>cometh, as deſolation,</hi> &amp;c. That, the men in whoſe calamity God laugheth are ſuch, is evident by the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter given of them at the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>Ye have ſet at nought all my counſel, and would none of my reproof.</hi> As if God had ſaid, you
<pb n="812" facs="tcp:104248:417"/> have laughed at my counſel, therefore I will laugh at your cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. The Lord will declare himſelf delighted in their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction who have deſpiſed inſtruction; and he will glorifie himſelf in the actings of his Juſtice upon them, who have ſlighted and put by the tenders and entreaties of his mercy. Yet ſtill God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth himſelf more pleaſed in acting and putting forth his ſaving power, then his deſtroying power. The Prophet (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8, 9.) moſt pathetically repreſents, as it were, a debate in the breaſt of God himſelf between his Juſtice and his Mercy; <hi>How ſhall I give thee up, Ephraim? How ſhall I deliver thee, Iſrael? How ſhall I make thee as Admah? How ſhall I ſet thee as Zeboim? Mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together;</hi> (v. 9.) <hi>I will not execute the fierceneſs of mine anger, I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to deſtroy Ephraim.</hi> We ſee after the debate, the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines for ſparing, not for deſtroying. So then, though he can, and will not only deſtroy, but laugh at the deſtruction of obſtinate ſinners, yet he loves to ſpare rather then to deſtroy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From the connexion of theſe two, pardoning and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring mercy, God ſaith firſt, I <hi>pardon,</hi> and then ſecondly, I <hi>will not deſtroy;</hi> who are they whom God will not deſtroy? they are are ſuch as he pardons.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>Pardoned perſons ſhall never be deſtroyed.</q>
                  <p>As ſoon as <hi>Nathan</hi> had ſaid to <hi>David, the Lord hath put away thy ſin,</hi> the very next word is this, <hi>thou ſhalt not dye,</hi> (2 Sam. 12.13.) if <hi>Davids</hi> ſin had not been pardoned, <hi>Daved</hi> muſt have dyed for it. 'Tis a Logical Maxime, <hi>When the Cauſe is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sublata cauſa collitur effectus.</note> 
                     <hi>the Effect is taken away;</hi> Sin is the cauſe of deſtruction, therefore when God takes away ſin, which is the cauſe, deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the effect muſt needs be taken away too; pardon deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſin, therefore how can they that are pardoned be deſtroyed? Pardon ſwallows up ſin. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks of life, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4.) <hi>That mortality might be ſwallowed up of life;</hi> Here, mortality ſwallows up our lives by degrees, but hereafter mortality ſhall be ſwallowed up at once of life; Now, as life ſhall then ſwallow up mortality, ſo pardon at preſent ſwalloweth up ſin; for as in our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified ſtate there ſhall never any thing of mortality appear, ſo in a pardon'd eſtate, nothing of ſin ſhall appear as to hurt us. Sin
<pb n="813" facs="tcp:104248:417"/> pardoned cannot be found, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 50.20.) <hi>In thoſe dayes, and in that time ſaith the Lord, the iniquity of Jacob ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none, and the ſins of Judah, and they ſhall not be found;</hi> why not? The Lord anſwers, <hi>for I will pardon them whom</hi> I <hi>reſerve:</hi> And if their ſins ſhall not be found, ſurely they ſhall not be found guilty, and therefore not deſtroyed: God may cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten them whom he hath pardoned, but he will not deſtroy thoſe whom he hath pardon'd; pardoned perſons may ſmart, and ſmart greatly for ſin, but they ſhall not dye eternally for it, they ſhall not be deſtroyed for it. <hi>David</hi> was pardoned, yet God told him, <hi>the ſword ſhall never depart from thy houſe;</hi> and the Lord told him particularly of a ſore deſtruction upon a part of his houſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; <hi>becauſe by this deed thou haſt given great occaſion to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God to blaſpheme,</hi> (thou being a Profeſſor, haſt opened the mouths of the wicked againſt profeſſion) therefore (though thou ſhalt not dye, yet) <hi>the childe alſo that is born unto thee ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two things which the pardon of ſin takes away. Firſt, the power or reigne of ſin; where-ever ſin is pardoned, the ſtrength of it is ſubdued. God doth not pardon ſin as Princes do; they may pardon an evil doer, and yet he ſtill remain as evil and as ready to do evil as ever; they may pardon a thief, and yet he continue to be a thief ſtill; but if God pardons a drunkard, an adulterer, or a thief, he doth not remain a drunkard, or an adulterer, or a thief ſtill; God takes away the power of that ſin which he pardoneth. Secondly, The pardon of ſin takes away the puniſhment of ſin; it may leave ſome chaſtiſement, but it wholly takes away the puniſhment. The Popiſh doctrine ſaith, the fault is taken away by pardon, but there is a commutation of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, eternal puniſhment is changed into temporal, either in this life, or that to come; hence their doctrines of Purgatory, and of Prayer for the dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which ſtuffe comes in upon this account. They caſt all men into three ſorts, ſome are Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Martyrs, men very eminently godly, and they go im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to heaven: there are another ſort, and theſe are Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates from, or perſecuters of the faith, notorious ſinners, theſe go immediately to hell: there are a third or middle ſort of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſinners, and they go immediately after death, neither to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven nor hell, but to Purgatory, where they muſt bear the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="814" facs="tcp:104248:418"/> of their ſins till they can be prayed out: Chriſt hath only got ſo much favour for them (ſay they) to change their eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment into a temporal. The grace of the Goſpel knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this Doctrine; that tells us when ſin is pardoned, all is pardoned, both guilt and puniſhment, both temporal and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, nothing remains but only chaſtiſement; how ſorely ſoever a believer ſuffers in this life, yet ſtrictly taken, it is but a chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and there remaineth nothing for him to ſuffer in the life which is to come. And if ſo, then</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pardon of ſin is a precious mercy.</hi> 'Tis ſo, Firſt, Becauſe it proceeds from the precious mercies of God. Secondly, Becauſe it comes thorow the precious blood of Chriſt, (<hi>Col.</hi> 1.14.) Thirdly, Becauſe it opens a door to all precious mercies; as ſin unpardoned with-holds all good things from us (<hi>Jer.</hi> 5.25.) ſo ſin pardoned opens the door for all mercy to flow in upon us. Chriſt ſaid to the ſick man (<hi>Matth.</hi> 9.2.) <hi>Be of good cheer, thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> Fourthly, It is a precious mercy, becauſe it ſtops and keeps off all evils and judgements ſtrictly ſo called, I <hi>forgive,</hi> I <hi>will not deſtroy.</hi> Our comforts cannot ſtand before the guilt of ſin, and our troubles cannot ſtand long before the pardon of ſin; (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.24.) The higheſt wtath of God appears in this, when he will not pardon; and it argues the greateſt diſpleaſure of man againſt man, when he prayeth that he may not be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. That was a moſt dreadful prayer of the Prophet, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.9.) <hi>The mean man is bowed down, and the mighty man humbles himſelf, therefore forgive them not;</hi> here was a prayer that they might not be forgiven; and the ground why he prayed ſo, ſeems to be as ſtrange, as the matter of it was dreadful. Is it a ſin to be excepted from pardon, to ſee a mean man bow down, and a mighty man humble himſelf? The meaning is, they bowed themſelves not to God, but to idols; all bowing and humbling our ſelves ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to worſhip an idol, or in idol worſhip, is rebelling againſt God. We have a like prayer (<hi>Jer.</hi> 18.23.) the Prophet having ſpoken of the plots and deviſings of the people againſt him, turns himſelf thus to God, <hi>Thou knoweſt all their counſel to ſlay me, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give not their iniquity, neither blot their ſin from thy ſight.</hi> Nothing can be wiſht worſe to any man then this, that his ſin may never be pardoned. And here it may be queſtioned, how the Prophet could make ſuch a prayer, which ſeems to have the height of all
<pb n="815" facs="tcp:104248:418"/> uncharitableneſs in it. I anſwer, firſt, The Prophet was led by an extraordinary Spirit to do this. Secondly, We are not to conceive that the Prophet prayed for their eternal condemnation, but that God would call them to a reckoning, and make them feel the evil of their own doings. There is a ſin unto death, for the pardon of which we are not to pray, (1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16.) yet there is no ſin about which we are to pray that it may never be pardoned. The worſt prayer that can be made againſt any man, is, that he may not be pardoned; and there is nothing better to be prayed for then pardon. It ſhewed the height of Chriſts love, when hanging on the Croſs, he prayed thus for his enemies, (<hi>Luke</hi> 23.34.) <hi>Father, forgive them, they know not what they do;</hi> And the <hi>Protomartyr Stephen</hi> breathed out a like ſpirit of charity, while he was breathing out his life (in a ſhower of ſtones powred upon him from more ſtony hearts, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.60.) with this prayer, <hi>Lord, lay not this ſin to their charge.</hi>

                  <p>Thus, I have finiſhed this 31<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, both according to our own Tranſlation, and that other inſiſted upon by many of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; only from the connexion of this verſe with the next, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the latter reading, <hi>(To God who ſaith I pardon, I will not deſtroy; it ſhould be ſaid, that which I ſee not teach thou me, if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.)</hi>

                  <q>The very conſideration that God is ready to pardon ſin, ſhould make us reſolved againſt the committing of ſin.</q>
                  <p>The ſin-pardoning mercy of God, is one of the higheſt and moſt ſpiritual arguments by which the ſoul is kept from ſin. <hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 130.4.) <hi>that thou mayſt be feared;</hi> that is, becauſe thou art ſo merciful as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſinners, therefore they ought to fear thee, in doing what thy will is, and in avoiding whatſoever is contrary to thy will. 'Tis propheſied, that frame of ſpirit ſhall dwell upon the people of God in the latter dayes, (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5.) <hi>They ſhall fear the Lord and his goodneſs;</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Si ſcirem ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turos &amp; Deos ignoſcituros, tamen non fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerem. <hi>Sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> they ſhall fear to offend the Lord becauſe he is ſo good, and ready to pardon. It was ſaid by a Heathen (and it may ſhame many who profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, that a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſaid ſo) <hi>if I did know that men ſhould never know the evil which I do, and that the gods</hi> (ſo he ſpeaks in their language) <hi>would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="816" facs="tcp:104248:419"/> and forgive the evil which I do, yet I would not do it.</hi> Surely, the ſpirit of a true believer muſt needs riſe thus high, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, upon the clear grounds of Goſpel grace, and diſcoveries of the free love of God. Cannot a true believer ſay, though I know that God will pardon my ſin, though he hath declared that my ſin is pardoned, and though I could be aſſured that men ſhould never know of this ſin, if I commit it, yet I will not do it. <hi>To God who ſaith I pardon, it ſhould be ſaid, I will ſin no more.</hi>

                  <p>There is a two-ſold ſight; Firſt, Corporal, the ſight of the bodily eye.

(<hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18.) When Chriſt
<pb n="817" facs="tcp:104248:419"/> had ſayd, <hi>For judgement am I come into the world, that they which ſee not might ſee, and that they which ſee might be made blinde;</hi> ſome of the Phariſees ſaid unto him (<hi>John</hi> 9.41.) <hi>are we blinde alſo?</hi> (have we no eyes?) <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto them, If ye were blinde, ye ſhould have no ſin, but now ye ſay we ſee, therefore your ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth;</hi> that is, your ſin remaineth upon you in the power and guilt of it. In that ſenſe alſo Chriſt uſeth the word (<hi>Math:</hi> 13.14.) <hi>Hearing ye ſhall hear, and not underſtand, and ſeeing ye ſhall ſee, and not perceive;</hi> ye ſhall have only ſuch a knowledge of God, and of the things of God, of his word, &amp; of his works, as will be of no other uſe to you, then to leave you without excuſe. <hi>Seeing ye ſhall ſee but not perceive;</hi> ye ſhall have a fruitleſs and an unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſight.</p>

                     <hi>That which</hi> I <hi>ſee not</hi> (or have no underſtanding of) <hi>teach thou me,</hi> is the prayer of the humble ſoule. But what were thoſe things, which he feared or ſuppoſed he did not ſee? Thoſe unſeene things might be of three ſorts.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Thoſe favours and mercies which he did not ſee (we have many mercies which are not knowne to us, or of which we take little, yea no notice at all) thoſe good turns, which I have received and have not been thankfull, or have not improved and made ſutable returns for them, ſhew thou me.</p>

And if</hi> I <hi>have acted unduely with reſpect to thy aimes in chaſtiſing me,</hi> I <hi>will doe ſo no more.</hi> The acts of God are plaine, but his aymes lie cloſe and are not perceived, but by an enlightned, yea and a very attentive eye. <hi>That which</hi> I <hi>ſee not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve; Firſt.</p>
                  <q>The choyceſt ſervants of God may be much in the darke about and ſhort in the knowledge of many things which it much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them to know.</q>
                  <pb n="818" facs="tcp:104248:420"/>
                  <p>Though every believer hath an eye, and an eye open to ſee the things of God, the things which concern his peace, yet the cleareſt-ſighted among believers know but in part (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9.) We all know, but we do not know all. Thoſe words of the Apoſtle may have a twoſold underſtanding. Firſt, we know, but a little of any thing, that which we know we have but a part of it in our knowledge; in this life we know nothing throughly, nothing to the bottome, no not common principles. <hi>David</hi> ſaith (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 119.96.) I <hi>have ſeen an end of all perfection, but thy commandement is exceeding broad;</hi> There is ſuch a perfection in thy commandement, that I cannot ſee, nor can any man come to the out-ſide of it in this world. And as the holineſs of God in the Law is exceeding broad, ſo there is a hight, a depth, a length, and a breadth in the love of God revealed in the Goſpel, which exceedeth all our knowledge. (<hi>Eph:</hi> 3.19.) <hi>That ye may know the love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. We know but a part of that love of God, the fruits and effects whereof are all our portion. We are not able to comprehend, though we labour to comprehend the breadth and length and depth and height of it. Our meaſure of loving God is to love him out of meaſure; but 'tis a very ſmall meaſure of the love of God to us which we can know. Thus we know but little of that we know. Secondly, <hi>We know in part,</hi> that is, there are many things which we know not at all, we have no knowledge of ſome things, which may be fully knowne. Though we know many of our ſins and corruptions, yet we have ſins and corruptions which we know not of (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12.) <hi>Who can underſtand his errors?</hi> Who can underſtand the errors of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding? who can underſtand the errors of his will? who can underſtand the errors of his affections? who can underſtand the errors of his actions? who can underſtand them all? yet they are all underſtandable. There are many errors in all theſe, which we know not to be errors, therefore we have need every one of us to pray as <hi>David</hi> there did, <hi>Clenſe thou me from my ſecret faults.</hi> From ſecret faults in my underſtanding, from ſecret faults in my will and affections, in my practice and converſation. The ſecret faults which he asked pardon for were not thoſe faults which he had committed in ſecret, or which other men know not of; but thoſe faults which were ſecrets to himſelfe, or which himſelfe knew not of: Further, we know not our faults; Firſt, either in reference
<pb n="819" facs="tcp:104248:420"/> to the doing of evill, or ſins of commiſſion; nor Secondly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the not doing of good or ſins of omiſſion; nor Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doe we know our faults in reference to the manner of doing that which is good. Though we doe not quite omit a duty, yet we faile many times in the doing of it. <hi>We doe little of the good which we ought, and little of the good which we doe is done as it ought.</hi> We have ſecret ſins not only of commiſſion in doing that which is evill, and of omiſſion in not doing that which is good, but alſo in doing good. There are many flaws and errors in our doing of that which is good, which, though we perceive not, yet the pure eyes of God perceive. So then, as we ſee not all our errors in omitting du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo we ſee not all our errors in performing duties; to ſee them requireth a ſpirituall ſight indeed. Many can ſee when they omit a duty altogether, and charge themſelves with a fault for it, but our faults in performance of duty, in prayer, in hearing none take notice of them, but they who have a ſpiritual eye, nor do they alwayes take notice of all of them, nor fully of any of them at any time. We are much in the dark about theſe errors which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany our holy duties. The iniquities of our holy things are many, and they lie very cloſe. We may quickly and eaſily fall into them, but we cannot eaſily diſcerne them.</p>
                  <p>For, Firſt, though we performe an act of worſhip, of Church-worſhip, of inſtituted worſhip, right for the ſubſtance, yet we may miſs and erre in ſeverall circumſtances, and not come up exactly to the outward performance of it. Secondly, much more may we run into errors and faults in the performance of duty, as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall part of it, or that frame of heart with which a duty is to be performed. We ſeldome, I may ſafely ſay, we never come up to that zeale, to that ſelf-abaſement, to that faith, to that love and delight which ſhould be in us when we approach to and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before God in the duties of his holy worſhip, whether pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or private. The beſt of Saints come farre ſhort of knowing all the evill and faylings of their evill and deceitfull hearts, while they are engaged about that which is good, how much more are they ſhort in the knowledge of God; and therefore what reaſon have we to ſay, as <hi>Elihu</hi> here directs the penitent ſoule to ſay; <hi>That which I know not teach thou me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="820" facs="tcp:104248:421"/>It is the duty of the moſt knowing ſervants of God to confeſſe their ignorance.</q>
                  <p>When <hi>Elihu</hi> would have <hi>Job</hi> ſay, <hi>That which I ſee not teach thou me,</hi> he would have him confeſſe, that there was ſome goed or evill which he did not ſee. He that deſireth God to teach him, what he doth not ſee, doth therein acknowledge that he doth not ſee all that he ought. Our underſtandings are imperfect as well as our wills and affections; and our ſins or imperfections where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they are muſt be confeſſed. The deficiency of our knowledge, or the imperfection of our underſtanding muſt be confeſſed as well as the imperfection of our will to doe good, and of our doing good. <hi>David</hi> layeth load upon himſelfe in confeſſing the faultineſſe of his underſtanding, or inability to judge aright of what he ſaw before him (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 73.22.) <hi>So ignorant was</hi> I <hi>and fooliſh, even as a beaſt before thee.</hi> And the ſpeciall poynt wherein he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his ignorance, was about the outward diſpenſations of God, in ſuffering wicked men to flouriſh. He had ignorant apprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and was quite out in that matter; and therefore befools himſelfe and calls himſelfe a beaſt, ſo far was he from ſeeing the mind and deſigne of God as became a Saint. Such an acknowledgement <hi>Agur</hi> made (<hi>Pro:</hi> 30.2.) <hi>I am more brutiſh then any man,</hi> I <hi>have not the underſtanding of a man, I neither learned wiſdome, nor have the knowledge of the holy.</hi> This worthy man confeſſed his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and as the more we know, the more we ſee our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſo the more we know, the more we confeſſe our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. They that have but little knowledge, are eſpecially defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in this poynt of knowledge to ſee their ignorance; and are therefore but little troubled with their ignorance. Many think they know enough; ſome, poſſibly, think they know all. They who have leaſt knowledge, are leaſt conſcious of their own ignorance. And as there are many ſins of ignorance, ſo ignorance it ſelfe is a ſin, and therefore to be confeſſed and bewailed before God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When <hi>El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hu</hi> brings in the penitent perſon confeſſing his ignorance, and begging inſtruction,</p>
                  <p>It teacheth us,
<q>Sins of ignorance need pardon.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As our ignorance needs pardon, ſo doe our ſins of ignorance. The law of <hi>Moſes</hi> teacheth this (<hi>Levit:</hi> 4.2.) <hi>If a ſoule ſhall ſin
<pb n="821" facs="tcp:104248:421"/> through ignorance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he ſhall bring his ſacrifice.</hi> He muſt make an attonement for his ſin of ignorance. And we have further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections about offerings for ſins of ignorance, when they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and made knowne to the ſinner himſelfe. (<hi>Lev:</hi> 5.2, 3, 4, 5, 6.) <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith the Law) <hi>he ſhall be guilty,</hi> that is, if when he knoweth his ſin, he doe not performe what the Law requireth in ſuch caſes, then he is not only ceremonially but morally guilty, as a neglecter if not as a deſpiſer of the ordinance and appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God for his cleanſing. <hi>That which I ſee not</hi>
                     <q>teach thou me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words are a prayer for divine teaching. The teaching of God is two-fold; Firſt, Immediate by his Spirit (<hi>John</hi> 14.26.) <hi>The Spirit which is the comforter ſhall come and teach you all things.</hi> And againe (1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27.) <hi>The anoynting</hi> (that is, the Spirit) <hi>which ye have received of him, abideth in you: and ye need not that any man teach you;</hi> that is, ye need not reſt in, or pin your faith upon the teachings of man; as you muſt not deſpiſe, ſo ye need not depend upon the inſtruction of man. Secondly, There is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate teaching, God teacheth by meanes, inſtruments, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Firſt, by the miniſtery of his word; Secondly, by the works of his hands. He teacheth, Firſt, by his works of creation; Secondly, by his works of providence, they are our maſters, tutors and inſtructers. Now when this penitent perſon prayeth, <hi>Teach thou me;</hi> we may underſtand him of both theſe teachings. Firſt, of immediate teaching by the Spirit, who is the anoynting. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of teaching by meanes, by the preaching of the word of God, and by his providences; in what way ſoever God is pleaſed to teach us, our hearts ſhould ſtand open to receive inſtruction. And what way ſoever we receive inſtruction, it is God that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us. Though men be the inſtruments, yet the effect is of him.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt.</p>
                  <q>God only is able to teach or ſhew us the things which we know not.</q>
                  <p>Men alone cannot. Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned them, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19.) <hi>Go teach all Nations.</hi> And (<hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11.) <hi>When he aſcended up on high he gave ſome Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and
<pb n="822" facs="tcp:104248:422"/> Teachers;</hi> yet no Teachers can bring home inſtruction without the teachings of God. The tenour of the new Covenant runs thus, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13.) <hi>All thy children ſhall be taught of the Lord.</hi> And again (<hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34.) <hi>They ſhall teach no more every one his neighbour,</hi> &amp;c. that is, they ſhall not be left to the teachings of man: or the teaching of God ſhall be ſo glorious, that all ſhall acknowledge it; though there be inſtruments, yet the flowing forth of the ſpirit ſhall be ſuch, that inſtruments and means ſhall be little taken notice of. For when he ſaith, <hi>they ſhall not teach every one his neighbour,</hi> it is not an abſolute Negative, but ſhews that there ſhall be a more excellent teaching; as when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.) <hi>Chriſt hath made us able Miniſters, not of the letter, but of the Spirit;</hi> This Negative is not abſolute, for the Apoſtles did teach the Letter, and the Spirit is uſually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by the Miniſtery of the letter, or of the external word; the word is (as it were) the chariot wherein the Spirit rideth, and cometh by the ear to the heart. So that, when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We are Miniſters not of the letter,</hi> &amp;c. his meaning is, we are rather, or we are more the Miniſters of the Spirit then of the letter. The inward teaching accompanying our Miniſtery, carryeth the matter, both for conviction and converſion, both for illumination and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, not the outward teaching (<hi>John</hi> 6.45.) <hi>Every man therefore that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> And how long ſoever we go to School to men, how long ſoever we ſit under the Miniſtery of the ableſt Goſpel Preachers in the world, we come not to Chriſt till the Father teacheth; till he joyn his inward teaching to the outward teaching of the Miniſter, the light and life of grace is not received. It is God who teacheth effectually, men teach but inſtrumentally. Thus it was propheſied of the Goſpel times (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3. &amp; <hi>Micah</hi> 4.2.) <hi>Many Nations ſhall come and ſay, Come and let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord, and to the Houſe of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his wayes, and we will walk in his paths,</hi> that is, he will accompany the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and meſſengers of his word with his Spirit, he will impower them from on high, and ſo we ſhall learn his Statutes, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his wayes. <hi>David</hi> aſcribes even his skill in Military affairs to Gods teaching, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.1.) <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord, my ſtrength, who teacheth my hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to war, and my fingers to fight.</hi> God only teacheth a man powerfully to be a good Souldier. Surely then, it
<pb n="823" facs="tcp:104248:422"/> is God only who teacheth us to be good Chriſtians, to be Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, to be holy. <hi>He hath his ſeat in heaven, who teacheth hearts on earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As theſe words hold out to us the temper of an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinner;</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>A gracious humble ſoul is teachable, or is willing to be taught.</q>
                  <p>As it is the duty of the Miniſters of the Goſpel <hi>to be apt to teach,</hi> that's their ſpecial gift, or characteriſtical property; ſo 'tis the peoples duty and grace to be apt to be taught, to be willing to be led, and inſtructed; naturally we are unteachable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable. As we know nothing of God ſavingly by nature, ſo we are not willing to know; we would ſit down in our ignorance, or at moſt in a form of knowledge. To be willing to learn, is the firſt, or rather the ſecond ſtep to learning. The firſt is a ſight of our ignorance; and the ſecond, a readineſs to be taught, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the means of knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The words being the form of a Prayer;</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>It is our duty to entreat the Lord earneſtly that he would teach us what we know not.</q>
                  <p>It is a great favour and a mercy, that God will teach us, that he will be our maſter, our Tutor. Now, as we are to ask and pray for every mercy, ſo for this, that God would vouchſafe to be our Teacher, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.4, 5.) <hi>Shew me thy wayes, O Lord, teach me thy paths; Lead me in thy truth, and teach me; David</hi> ſpake it twice in prayer, <hi>Lead me,</hi> and <hi>Teach me:</hi> Lead me on in the truth which I know, and teach me the truths which I know not. So he prayeth again, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.26.) <hi>Teach me thy Statutes, make me to underſtand the way of thy precepts. David</hi> was convinced that he could not underſtand the Statutes of God, unleſs God would be his Teacher; though he could read the Statutes of God, and underſtand the language of them, yet he did not underſtand the Spirit of them till he was taught (and taught) of God, and therefore he prayed ſo earneſtly, once and again, for his teaching. When <hi>Philip</hi> put that queſtion to the Eunuch (<hi>Acts</hi> 8.30.) <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandest thou what thou readeſt? He ſaid, how can I except ſome
<pb n="824" facs="tcp:104248:423"/> man ſhould guide me?</hi> Or, unleſs I am taught. Though we read the Statutes of God, and read them every day, yet we ſhall know little unleſs the Lord teach us. <hi>Solomon</hi> made it his requeſt for all Iſrael at the ſolemn Dedication of the Temple, (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.37.) <hi>Teach them the good way wherein they ſhould walk.</hi> God who is our Commander is alſo our Counſeller.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, From the ſpecial matter wherein this penitent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would be taught, which is plain from part of the latter verſe, <hi>If I have done iniquity;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>A gracious heart is willing to know and ſee the worſt of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</q>
                  <p>He would have God teach him what iniquity he hath done. <hi>David</hi> was often upon that prayer, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.24.) <hi>Search me, O God, and know my heart, and ſee if there be any wicked way in me.</hi> Lord, ſhew me my ſin; as I would not conceal my ſin from thee, ſo I would not have my ſin concealed from my ſelf. A car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal man who lives in ſin (though poſſibly he may pray for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in ſome things, and would be a knowing man, yet he) hath no minde that either God or man ſhould ſhew him his ſin; He loves not to ſee the worſt of himſelf, his dark part; he as little loves to ſee his ſin, as to have it ſeen. But a godly man never thinks he ſeeth his ſin enough; <hi>how little ſoever he ſins, he thinks he ſins too much,</hi> (that's the general bent of a gracious mans heart) <hi>and how much ſoever he ſees his ſin, he thinks he ſees it too little.</hi> And therefore as he tells God what he knows of his ſin, ſo he would have God tell him that of his ſin which he doth not know. <hi>That which I know not, teach thou me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>If <hi>I</hi> have done iniquity, <hi>I</hi> will do no more.</q>
                  <p>There are two ſpecial parts of repentance. Firſt, Confeſſion of ſin, whether known or unknown. This we have in the former part of the verſe, <hi>That which</hi> I <hi>ſee not, teach thou me.</hi> There is the confeſſion of ſin, even of unknown ſin. The ſecond part of repentance is reformation or amendment, a turning from ſin, a forſaking of that iniquity which we deſire God would ſhew us, we have this ſecond part of repentance in this latter part of the verſe.</p>
                  <pb n="825" facs="tcp:104248:423"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If</hi> I <hi>have done iniquity,</hi> I <hi>will do no more.</hi> But why doth he ſay, <hi>If</hi> I <hi>have?</hi> &amp;c. Had he any any doubt whether he had done ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity or no? every man muſt confeſs, down right, that he hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and done iniquity, without ifs or an's. <hi>Solomon</hi> having made ſuch a ſuppoſition in his prayer at the Dedication of the Temple, (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.46.) <hi>If they ſin againſt thee</hi>) preſently puts it into this poſition, <hi>for there is no man that ſinneth not.</hi> The Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, (1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8.) <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> Therefore, this, <hi>If</hi> I <hi>have done iniquity</hi> is not to be underſtood as if this or that man, as if he or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man might be without ſin; but when the penitent is brought in, ſaying, <hi>If I have done iniquity;</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> meaning is, Firſt, What ever iniquity I have done, I am willing to leave it, to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it, I will do ſo no more. Secondly, Thus, <hi>If I have done iniquity,</hi> that is, if I have done any great iniquity,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

As if he had ſaid, <hi>though</hi> I <hi>cannot promiſe that I will ſin no more; yet, Lord, if thou doſt diſcover to me any iniquity, any groſs ſin or perverſeneſſe, I will do that no more,</hi> I will engage my ſelf againſt that ſin with all my might; and to the utmoſt of my power, by grace received, I will keep my ſelf pure from every ſin. <hi>If I have done iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note. Firſt,
<q>A godly man hath a gracious ſuſpition of himſelf that he hath done evil, yea ſome great evil, that he hath done amiſs, yea greatly amiſs, though he be not able to charge himſelf with this or that particular iniquity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He knoweth he hath ſinned &amp; done evil, though he knoweth not every evil he hath done, nor how ſinfully he may have ſinned; he doubts it may be worſe with him then he ſeeth. Poſſibly <hi>he hath done iniquity. Job</hi> in reference to his children (<hi>chap.</hi> 1.5.) had an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſpition that in their feaſting they might ſin againſt God; he knew no ſin they had run into, nor could charge them with any exceſs; but he was jealous they had ſinned; nor did <hi>Job</hi> ſpeak thus, as if his meaning were, that poſſibly in their feaſting ſome corruption might work in them, (he knew there is no man in the beſt duties of his life wholly freed from the workings of ſin) but, he had this jealouſie, that they might have fallen into ſome great
<pb n="826" facs="tcp:104248:424"/> ſin, and ſo provoked God greatly againſt them, therefore he did (as it were) way-lay ſuch guilt, and early ſought reconciliation with God. As <hi>Job</hi> was thus jealous of his children, ſo a gracious heart, though he cannot charge himſelfe with this or that evill, yet he is apt to ſuſpect his owne heart, and feares it may be worſe with him, then poſſibly, it is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When he ſaith, <hi>If</hi> I <hi>have done iniquity;</hi> This hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, though he doth ſuppoſe that he might have done ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, yet he doth but ſuppoſe it.</p>

                  <q>A godly man may live free from the doing of any groſſe ſin.</q>
                  <p>He doth not put an <hi>if</hi> upon it whether he had ſinned or no, but, whether he had done iniquity. <hi>Zachariah</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were not without ſin, but they did no iniquity; for, ſaith the text (<hi>Luke</hi> 1.6.) <hi>They were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandements and ordinances of the Lord blameleſſe.</hi> It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagined but that the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſinned, yet (<hi>Num:</hi> 23.21.) <hi>God ſaw no iniquity in Jacob, nor perverſeneſſe in Iſrael.</hi> There may be ſuch a time in the Church when the people of God have no iniquity, no provocation to be ſeene or found among them. Though a Godly man cannot deny but he hath ſinned, yet he can affirme that he hath not indulged himſelfe in any ſin. <hi>If</hi> I <hi>have done iniquity,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <hi>I</hi> will doe no more.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Hebrew is, I <hi>will not adde.</hi> We render, I <hi>will doe no more.</hi> As if he had ſayd; If upon tryall, it be found that I have done iniquity, yet I will not adde iniquity to iniquity, I will not goe on, I will not perſiſt, nor proceed in iniquity. I will not take a ſtep more in any way which God ſhall diſcover to me to be an evill way. If I am out of the way, I will not goe on in my way.</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> A godly penitent perſon is reſolute againſt ſin.</q>
                  <p>His will is ſet againſt it; <hi>I will doe no more.</hi> I ſhewed in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former verſe <hi>(It is meere to be ſayd unto God,</hi> I <hi>have borne chaſtiſement,</hi> I <hi>will offend no more)</hi> in what ſence a godly man may make ſuch a promiſe, or ſay, I <hi>will ſin no more;</hi> here I ſay, <hi>A godly
<pb n="827" facs="tcp:104248:424"/> man is reſolute againſt ſin, eſpecially againſt great ſins.</hi> As a carnall man hath but very weake reſolves for the doing of good, he hath (as ſome expreſſe it) but a <hi>velleity,</hi> ſomewhat like a will to doe that which is good; ſo a carnall man makes but weake reſolves againſt evill, he hath not a ſetled will, but a kind of <hi>noleity</hi> againſt it. He makes ſome flouriſhes of profeſſion againſt it, but he is not reſolvedly ingaged againſt it; whereas a godly man is reſolute both as to the doing of good, and the not doing of evill. If a godly man might have his will, he would never ſin more; And as a Godly man waiteth joyfully for that ſtate of glory wherein he ſhall ſin no more; ſo a reſolution to ſin no more, hath, as I may ſay, ſomewhat of glory in it. In glory we ſhall ſin no more, and where grace is in truth, that ſoule would gladly be rid of ſin, and ſin no more. A godly man is reſolved againſt all ungodlineſſe; and this is a kind of entrance into glory.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Whereas the penitent man ſaith, I <hi>will doe no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>Continuance in any knowne ſin (<hi>for, ſaith he,</hi> what <hi>I</hi> know not teach thou me) or in that which is made knowne to us to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, is inconſiſtent with true repentance.</q>
                  <p>Repentance for and continuance in ſin, cannot conſiſt in the ſame ſubject. This is the voyce of every gracious ſoule, I would not ſin any more, or I would not continue any longer in ſin. To ſin is common to man, but to continue in ſin, is proper to a wicked man. To erre and faile that's humane, but to perſevere in error is diabolicall. Sin will continue in us while we continue in this world; but they that are not of the world, doe not, will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſin, how long ſo ever they are in the world. Sin may be conſidered three wayes. Firſt, as remaining in us; Secondly, as reſerved; Thirdly, as preſerved by us. There is ſin remaining in the beſt of Saints on this ſide heaven (<hi>Rom:</hi> 7.20, 21, 22, 23, 24.) Sin is reſerved only in carnall men, they ſave their ſins, and would be ſaved, not from but in their ſins. Sin is preſerved or maintained and defended in the worſt of wicked men. Sin is heightned to the utmoſt, where 'tis not only retained, but main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and preſerved. The Apoſtle having cloſed the fifth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> in the triumph of Goſpel grace. <hi>That as ſin hath reigned unto death, ſo grace might reigne through
<pb n="828" facs="tcp:104248:425"/> righteouſneſſe unto eternall life by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> begins the next with a prevention of the abuſe of this Grace; <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, ſhall we continue in ſin that grace may abound? God forbid. How ſhall we that are dead to ſin, live any longer therein?</hi> How can we continue in ſin, that are partakers of Goſpel grace? Sin will continue in us, but we cannot continue in it. The queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on implyeth a kind of impoſſibility. We were once dead in ſin, but now we are dead to ſin, how then can we live or continue in it? <hi>Perſeverance is either our beſt or our worſt.</hi> To perſevere is beſt when we perſevere in good, and to perſevere is worſt when we perſevere in evill. It is bad to be or doe evill, but it is worſe to abide in evill. The firſt beſt is not to ſin, the next beſt is not to continue, nor lodge in ſin, no not for an houre. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayd in another caſe (<hi>Gal:</hi> 2.5.) <hi>To whom we gave place by ſubjection, no not for an houre;</hi> We ſhould not give place to ſin, no not for a minute, but reſiſt it to the utmoſt, and totally diſplace it, if we can.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, From the Hebrew elegancy, which ſaith, I <hi>will not adde.</hi>

                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>A godly man may commit ſin after ſin, but he doth not adde ſin to ſin.</q>
                  <p>When he hath committed any one ſin, he breaks it off and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtroyeth it by repentance. He doth not adde ſin to ſin, becauſe the ſin formerly committed is deſtroyed by repentance. His for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſin is taken off the file before he acts a ſecond, who hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily repenteth of the firſt, and as heartily reſolveth not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a ſecond. Such a man doth not run a round of ſinning and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, though he ſinneth after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he hath repented. <hi>Daniel</hi> gave that advice to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> (Dan: 4.27.) <hi>Break off thy ſins by righteouſneſſe, and thine iniquities by ſhewing mercy to the poore.</hi> If thou repenteſt indeed, the ſin that cometh after will not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to thy former, becauſe that is done away through Grace. A godly man (according to the former poynt) would not adde or commit another act of ſin to his former; as it is ſayd of <hi>Judah</hi> (Gen: 38.26.) who had committed folly with <hi>Tamar, He knew her againe no more.</hi> Though his ſin was great, yet doubtleſſe his heart was humbled, and he returned not to his former ſin. But the
<pb n="829" facs="tcp:104248:425"/> wicked man continues in his wickedneſſe, yea, he <hi>bleſſeth himſelfe in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though</hi> I <hi>walk in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e heart, to adde drunkenneſſe to thirſt</hi> (Deut: 29.19.) Every new ſin is an addition to his former ſins, becauſe he alwayes liveth in ſin. They who would not have the captives brought into the City, gave this reaſon (2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 28.13.) <hi>For whereas we have offended againſt the Lord already, ye intend to adde more to our ſins,</hi> &amp;c. O take heed of ſinning ſo, as to joyne ſins together. As in Arithmeticke when we adde ſumme to ſumme, what an huge ſumme may we quickly make. Therefore breake off ſin by repentance, that if thou ſinneſt againe, it may not be an adding of ſin to ſin. That's a dreadfull propheſie and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 69.27.) <hi>Adde iniquity to their iniquity, and let them not come into thy righteouſneſſe.</hi> How doth the Lord adde iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to iniquity? will he cauſe any to ſin more? or will he doe any iniquity? No; the meaning is (as our margin intimates) the Lord will adde the puniſhment of their iniquity to their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or he will give them up to the power of their owne luſts and vile affections, ſo that they cannot but renew the acts of ſin, and adde one iniquity to another. It is a bleſſed worke when we are much in the additions of grace to grace, and of good workes to good. 'Tis the deſigne and buſineſſe of a gracious heart to adde grace to grace, that is, the exerciſe of one grace to another, till every grace be exerciſed (2 <hi>Pet:</hi> 1.5.) <hi>Give diligence to adde to your faith vertue, and to vertue knowledge, and to knowledge tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and to temperance patience.</hi> Here is a bleſſed addition. When a good man hath done well once, he adds to doe more, he adds more acts of the ſame kind, and he adds to doe good acts of any other kinde; He adds patience to godlineſſe, and to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe brotherly kindneſs, and to brotherly kindneſs charity; thus he is buſied in a bleſſed way of addition. But the addition of ſin to ſin, is the bitter fruit of rebellion againſt God (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.1.) <hi>Wo to the rebellious children — that cover, but not with a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of my Spirit, that they may adde ſin to ſin.</hi> They that make excuſes for ſin committed, adde ſin to ſin; yet by theſe cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, we may underſtand not only excuſes and pretences, for ſin acted, but our owne good acts; for to cover ſin with any thing of our owne, is to adde ſin to ſin. Yet I conceive, the adding of one kind of ſin to another, is the addition there meant. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
                     <pb n="830" facs="tcp:104248:426"/> ſayd to <hi>Samuel,</hi> when they were brought to a ſight of their ſin (1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 12.19.) <hi>We have added unto all our ſins this evill to ask us a King.</hi> They refuſed the Lords government, and asked a king in the pride of their hearts, and ſo added ſin to ſin. Thus 'tis ſayd of <hi>Herod</hi> (Luke 3.20.) <hi>That to all his evill deeds, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this, that he ſhut up John in priſon.</hi> And as there is an adding of ſeverall kinds of ſin, ſo of ſeverall acts of the ſame kind of ſin, oath to oath, and adultery to adultery, and wrong-dealing to wrong-dealing; this day ſome oppreſſe their brethren, and the next day they doe the ſame. O let ſuch remember what additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Lord will make to them, he will adde puniſhment to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, he will adde the ſame kind of puniſhment ſeveral times, he will adde ſword to ſword, and famine to famine, and peſtilence to peſtilence, and he will adde puniſhments of various kinds. The Prophet reports what various or (if I may ſo ſpeake) hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal kindes of ſin men added and ſtrung up together. (<hi>Hoſ:</hi> 4.2.) <hi>By ſwearing, and lying, and killing, and ſtealing, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting adultery, they break out and blood toucheth blood.</hi> Surely, God will make blood touch blood in a way of puniſhment, as men make blood touch blood in a way of ſin. The adding of ſins makes an addition of plagues. <hi>When Jehoiakim the King heard the roll read, he threw it into the fire and burnt it</hi> (Jer: 36.) but could he burne or make an end of the threatnings? no (<hi>v.</hi> 32.) <hi>And there were added beſides unto them many like words.</hi> It is ſayd (<hi>Rev:</hi> 22.18.) <hi>If any man ſhall adde unto theſe things, God ſhall adde unto him the plagues that are written in this booke.</hi> To adde any thing to the holy word of God, is as ſinfull as to take from the word, or act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. God can adde plagues as faſt as men adde ſins. When ſin is added to ſin, then guilt is added to guilt, and puniſhment to puniſhment. Take heed of this addition, reſolve with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſoule in the text; <hi>If I have done iniquity, I will adde no more.</hi>

               <p>IN the Context of theſe three verſes <hi>Elihu</hi> doth chiefly theſe two things. Firſt, he appeales to the Conſcience of <hi>Job</hi> (v. 33.) <hi>Should it be according to thy mind?</hi> ask thy ſelfe whether it ſhould be ſo, yea or no. Secondly, he appeals to the judgement of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, yea of all wiſe and underſtanding men, concerning what <hi>Job</hi> had ſpoken, or whether he had not ſpoken unwiſely, in the 33<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 34<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſes; <hi>Let men of underſtanding tell me, and let a wiſe man hearken unto me.

               </p>
               <p>The ſcope of <hi>Elihu</hi> in theſe words is yet further to humble <hi>Job,</hi> and to provoke him to repentance for his inconſiderate ſpeeches. Yet <hi>Elihu</hi> doth not call <hi>Job</hi> to repentance upon the ſame grounds or termes as his three friends had done.

<pb n="832" facs="tcp:104248:427"/> and ſubſtance of what is held out in moſt of them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some give it thus; <hi>Should he reward it according to thy minde, though thou haſt deſpiſed the one, and choſen the other, yet will not I, therefore ſpeake what thou knoweſt.</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>Why ſhould God reward him, as thou wouldeſt have him doe it?

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Another thus; <hi>Should it come from thee, how he ſhould recompence is, when thou haſt refuſed his correction? but thou ſhalt chooſe and not</hi> I, <hi>therefore ſpeake what thou knoweſt.</hi> The ſence of which tranſlation may be thus repreſented; <hi>Shouldeſt thou who haſt ſinned, and refuſeſt to be corrected, teach God how he ſhould correct thee?

                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe rendrings may be reduced to this one common ſence; <hi>O Job, whatſoever thou ſuffereſt, or by what meanes ſoever thou art fallen into this miſery, is it fit that God ſhould be ordered by thy opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Judgement? And ſurely, O Job, I muſt tell thee plainly, nor canſt thou deny it, that thou haſt not reſted nor ſat down quietly in the determination and decree of God concerning thee; But thou wouldeſt rather be chuſing and preſcribing to God, how and in what way he ſhould deale with thee, and diſpence his providences to thee, then ſatisfie thy ſelfe in his appoyntments and pleaſure. Farre be it from me, that I ſhould follow thy example, or tread in thy ſteps as to this matter; yet if thou haſt any thing to reply to what I have ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſay onne, bring it forth, let me and all in thy preſence, heare and judge of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> poynts <hi>Job</hi> to his grand error, that he did not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily approve, nor quietly ſubmit to the Judgement of God in his owne caſe. And ſo had not ſpoken reverently enough of God, nor humbly enough of himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of theſe various readings and rendrings mentioned, is the conciſeneſs of the Hebrew text, which leaves ſome words to be underſtood and ſupplyed for the compleating of the ſenſe. And becauſe the moſt skilfull Interpreters are not perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the dialect or manner of ſpeech uſed in thoſe more remote and ancient times, therefore they muſt needs differ both in their tranſlations and expoſitions, yet (which may free the reader from all prejudices againſt the holy Scriptures, either as obſcure or dubious) they all center and agree in that which is true in it ſelfe, as alſo in the principall ſcope and drift of <hi>Elihu</hi> in this diſcourſe with <hi>Job.</hi>

Further, the word which we here tranſlate to <hi>refuſe,</hi> ſignifies more then that ſimple act of the will, it ſignifies to refuſe with a kind of diſdain
<pb n="835" facs="tcp:104248:428"/> and great diſguſt; to refuſe a thing as altogether unworthy to be received; or to refuſe a thing as being much diſpleaſed and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with it. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> uſeth this word (<hi>Chap:</hi> 5.17.) <hi>Deſpiſe thou not the chaſtening of the Lord;</hi> that is, doe not refuſe it with a diſlike, or as a thing that is grievous and nauſeous to thee.

                  </p>

                  <p>From the words thus opened (<hi>Should it be according to thy mind?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve; Firſt.</p>
                  <q>Man would have every thing goe according to his mind.</q>
                  <p>He would have his mind the meaſure both of all that he is to doe for God; and of all that God doth to him. We love to doe all things according to our own minds, and we love to have all things done according to our own minds. Man naturally would doe nothing according to Gods mind; nor would he have any thing done to him according to Gods mind, unleſſe it accord with his owne too. The Apoſtle (<hi>Rom:</hi> 8.7.) proclaimes that Innate Enmity that is in the heart of all men naturally againſt the mind and will of God; <hi>The wiſdome of the fleſh is Enmity againſt God: It is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be;</hi> that is, while a man remaines fleſh, or in an unregenerate ſtate, he is altogether at enmity againſt the Law of God; both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what God appoynts him to do, &amp; againſt what he appoynts
<pb n="836" facs="tcp:104248:429"/> him to ſuffer. Man equally riſeth up in his thoughts, and rebells a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt both. And as this enmity doth remaine whole and unbroken in all men by nature, till they are renewed by grace and borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; ſo there are remainders of it, even in thoſe who are renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by grace; there is ſomewhat of this oppoſition againſt God in every godly man; he would fain have things goe according to his mind; and he hath much of this mind in him; I doe not ſay, a godly man would doe nothing according to Gods mind, that's the naturall mans frame; but a godly man would very fain have God doe things according to his mind, as may appeare, eſpecially in foure things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He would have God reward, or doe good both to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and others, according to his mind; He would have God lift up thoſe whom he would have lifted up, and preferre thoſe whom he would have preferr'd; he would faine have God ſhew favour to or beſtow favours upon thoſe whom he favours.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As to puniſhment and Judgement, he would have God puniſh according to his mind; ſuch a man is proud; he is an oppreſſor, he is an oppoſer of goodneſſe and good men, therefore he would have the hand of God heavy upon him, to caſt him down out of hand, or without delay.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He would have God goe according to his mind in chaſtning and afflicting himſelfe; though he would not be totally uncorrected, yet he would have God correct him only in ſuch a kind, in ſuch a manner and meaſure as he would chuſe; he doth not refuſe chaſtening, but he would be chaſtened in what himſelfe pleaſeth, or in his owne way. He ſaith in his heart, if God would correct me in this or that, I could bear it, but I doe not like to be corrected in ſuch a thing, or in ſuch a way; one ſaith, if God would ſmite me in my Eſtate I could bear it, but not in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; Another ſaith, if God ſhould ſmite me with ſickneſſe, I could bear it, but not in my Children; or let the affliction be what God pleaſeth, if God would afflict me but thus much, or thus farre, in ſuch a degree, I could ſubmit, but my heart can hardly yeild to this meaſure of affliction. Thus we would have it according to our minds, as to the meaſure, as alſo for the continuance of our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. We would be corrected for ſo long, for ſo many dayes, but to have months of vanity, and yeares of trouble, this is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our mind.</p>
                  <pb n="837" facs="tcp:104248:429"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, He would have God govern (not only himſelfe but) the whole world according to his mind: Man hath much of this in him, he would have God order nations as himſelfe and other men like himſelfe deſire. Some one man would preſcribe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect what God ſhould doe, and how he ſhould doe to all men. <hi>Luther</hi> writ to <hi>Melanchton</hi> when he was ſo exceedingly troubled at the providences of God in the world;<note place="margin">Admonendus eſt Philippus ut deſmat mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum regere.</note> 
                     <hi>Our Brother Philip is to be admoniſht, that he would forbear governing the world;</hi> we can hardly let God alone to rule that world which himſelfe alone hath made; <hi>Should it be according to thy mind?</hi> to this mans mind, or that mans mind? it muſt not be as it is; if every man might have his mind, he would govern and rule the world in another way then God doth. There is ſcarce any Good man that is ſatisfied in the government of particular nations, if he might have his mind, he would caſt things into another mould and method then the providence of God hath caſt them in at this day. Yea, 'tis ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that it either raines or ſhines according to our mind; The weather which God is pleaſed to ſend, whether wet or dry, fayre or foule, rarely pleaſeth us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>Should it be according to thy mind?</hi> This queſtion implyeth a ſtrong Negation; certainly, it ſhould not.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>'Tis beſide the duty and above the line of man to deſire that things ſhould be according to his mind, either with himſelfe or with others.</q>
                  <p>There's nothing more againſt the mind of God, nor againſt our owne good, then that all things ſhould be according to our mind; we may quickly undoe our ſelves and diſhonour God by having our owne deſires. And that it is ſinfull, very ſinfull to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have our owne deſires, may appeare, by conſidering the ſpring or roote of ſuch deſires, I ſhall ſhew a three-fold very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill roote from whence thoſe deſires ſpring.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They ſpring from pride and an over-weening conceit of our ſelves; and that upon a double account; Firſt, from pride as to our deſerts; for if God doe ſuch men good, they are apt to think they have deſerved more good, then God hath done them; and if God afflict them, they are ready to ſay, ſurely they have
<pb n="838" facs="tcp:104248:430"/> not deſerved ſo much affliction. We think we have deſerved grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kindneſs then God exhibits; and that we have not deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to great a croſſe as he inflicts. Is not this a great piece of pride?</p>
                  <p>Againe, Theſe deſires ſpring from pride in our own wiſdome &amp; underſtanding; as if we knew how to order matters more equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then God. Is it not a huge piece of pride, of luciferian pride, to thinke that there might be a better meaſure of things then the mind of God is? doth not ſuch a man make himſelfe wiſer then God? and more prudent then God? doth not he ſuppoſe, that he ſees further into things then God? when as alas we cannot ſee an houre before us, but God hath the proſpect of all things, He ſeeth <hi>the end from the beginning,</hi> and hath all in his eye from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. When we thus make our ſelves wiſer then God, is not this a high poynt of pride? Here's the firſt evill roote of deſiring to have things according to our mind, <hi>pride,</hi> or an opinion that we deſerve better, or could order things better.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Theſe deſires proceed as from pride, ſo from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content with the dealings of God, and 'tis pride that fills us with diſcontent; he that would have things according to his minde, muſt needs be disſatisfied when they are not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when they ſpring not from direct diſcontent, yet they do from ſome degree of impatience. There is not ſuch a quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit or acquieſcence as ſhould be in the heart of man, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he would let things be according unto Gods minde, and never be troubled, when they are not according to his own. Now conſider what can ſpring from theſe three roots, Pride, Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and Impatience, but very evil and bitter fruit; therefore, to deſire to have things according to our mind is very ſinful, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinful.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This queſtion, <hi>Should it be according to thy minde?</hi> implyeth a ſharp rebuke and a reproof upon <hi>Job,</hi> as deſiring a thing which was altogether againſt rule and reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>It is moſt unreaſonable and abſurd, to deſire that things ſhould be ordered as we would have them, and not as God would have them.</q>
                  <p>Is it not unreaſonable in a family that things ſhould be as the
<pb n="839" facs="tcp:104248:430"/> children would have them, and not as the Father would have them? Or, that things ſhould be done according to the minde of the ſervants, and not according to the minde of the Maſter? Do not the Magiſtrates and Governours of the world think it an unreaſonable thing that Nations ſhould be governed according to the minde of Subjects, and not according to the minde of the Prince, regulated according to the known Laws of the Nation? Who doth not think it an unreaſonable thing, that a journey ſhould be diſpoſed according to the minde of the Horſe, and not according to the minde of the Rider? Should the horſe guide the Rider, or the Rider his horſe? Is it not an unreaſonable thing that a mans ſenſe ſhould guide his underſtanding, when his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is given on purpoſe to guide his ſenſe? Is it not an unreaſonable thing that paſſion ſhould order reaſon, when as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be the bridle of our paſſion? Is it not an unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing that unlearned ignorant men ſhould teach the knowing, when the learned &amp; knowing are ſet up to teach the ignorant? and is it not much more abſurd and unreaſonable for us, to deſire that things ſhould be according to our minde, either with our ſelves or others, families, or Nations, and not according to the minde of God? Should things be as the beſt, as the wiſeſt, as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyeſt men in the world would have them, and not as God would have them; it were more abſurd and unreaſonable then that things ſhould go in a family according to the minde of the ſervants and children, rather then according to the minde of the Maſter and Father; yea it were more abſurd then any of thoſe fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abſurdities. <hi>Should it be according to thy minde,</hi> O <hi>Job?</hi> how unreaſonable a thing were that!</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, From thoſe words, <hi>He will recompence it, whether thou refuſe, or whether thou chuſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>God will not yeild to men, nor be ſubject to their pleaſure.</q>
                  <p>God will do what he pleaſeth, as I may ſay, in ſpight of any mans teeth. Things muſt paſs in ſuch a way as God hath appointed, and ſees meet to diſpoſe of them; and not as we would have them. <hi>He will recompence:</hi> God is reſolute for the doing of his own will, and men are uſually over-reſolute for the doing of theirs; and indeed ſome are as it were wholly changed into will, or rather wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs;
<pb n="840" facs="tcp:104248:431"/> 
                     <hi>they will do this, and they will do that; they will have this, and they will have that.</hi> Men may quickly, but God can never act too highly, too ſtrongly, too confidently upon his own will; the reaſon is, becauſe his will is an holy will, and the rule of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Only Conſider from the whole.</p>
                  <q>Man is never diſpleaſed with what God doth, till he forgetteth what himſelf is.</q>
                  <p>Man forgets that he is a worm, and no man, he forgets that he is a creature, he forgets himſelf to be duſt and aſhes, elſe his ſpirit would not be wrought up to ſuch a height, to have things go according to his minde, and not according to the minde and will of God.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing God will have every thing go according to his minde and will, know there's no ſtriving nor ſtrugling with God; if man will not bow to the will of God, he ſhall be broken by the will of God: if he will not ſubmit to it, he muſt fall by it. There's no avoiding one of theſe two, <hi>for he will recompence.</hi> Therefore let us yeild up our ſelves freely to God, to be ruled by him, and not ſet him the rule, no nor ſo much as give him advice; let us receive the Law, and take advice from him. <hi>God is our Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but we muſt not be ſo much as his Councellors.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the eternal purpoſes and decrees of God, ſaith (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.34.) <hi>Who hath been his Councellor?</hi> As God had none to counſel him concerning his eternal purpoſes, ſo we muſt not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to counſel him as to his daylie providences or diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either toward our ſelves, or others; the true rule of our life is, to yeild our ſelves to be ruled by God. <hi>He will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence it, whether we chuſe, or whether we refuſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And not <hi>I.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>As if he had ſaid, If thou wilt ſtruggle with the will of God, thou mayeſt, but I will not. God will go his own way, and do as he ſees good, ſay thou what thou canſt, or howſoever it pleaſe or diſpleaſe thee. And for mine own part, I dare not entertain or give way to a thought of preſcribing to him in any of theſe things, what he ſhould do; no nor be unſatisfied with, much leſs cenſure, what he hath done. Therefore, if thou canſt acquit thy ſelf of this crime and accuſation which I have laid to thy charge,
<pb n="841" facs="tcp:104248:431"/> as thou didſt theirs who ſpake before, do it, ſay what thou canſt for thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>He that ſees another do amiſs, ought to take heed of doing the like himſelf.</q>
                  <p>Again, As theſe words, <hi>and not I,</hi> refer to the word <hi>recompence, He will recompence, whether thou chuſe, or whether thou refuſe;</hi> the meaning of them may be conceived, as if <hi>Elihu</hi> had thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken <hi>Job, If thou doſt ſmart for thy pride, and the height of thy ſpirit, if God pay thee home for it, do not lay the fault upon me; I have given thee counſel to direct thee better, I deſire not thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt come under ſuch a handling, but certainly God will do it.</hi> When we have declar'd the minde and will of God, in the ſeverity of his judgements upon ſinners, it is good for us to ſay, God will do it, and not we. The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> (chap. 17.16.) having warned them of an evil day, addes, <hi>Nor have I deſired the woful day, Lord thou knoweſt it: Jeremy</hi> had ſpoken woful things againſt that people, but (ſaith he) I have not deſired that woful day, though I have propheſied of it. So <hi>Elihu</hi> ſeems to ſpeak, he will recompence, and <hi>not I;</hi> though it be not in my minde, yet I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thee 'tis the mind of God.</p>
                  <p>Yet further, Some read theſe words with the former as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation or rebuking queſtion made by God himſelf; <hi>What? Should you chuſe, and not I? Election or choice is my priviledge, not thine, thou muſt not think to preſcribe to me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verba Dei per Mimeſmeſſe puto. <hi>Merc.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>I will chaſten and afflict, as I think fit, or according to my own will, not according to thine. Thus he brings in God ſpeaking to Job; thou findeſt thy ſelf much aggrieved, and complaineſt that thou art afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more then is meete; It ſhould ſeem then, that I muſt do what thou thinkeſt fit, not what I think fit my ſelf. Surely thou muſt give me the rule, how much, how long, and in what manner I muſt correct both thy ſelf and others.</hi> Should you chuſe, and not I: How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely!</p>
                  <q>Therefore ſpeak what thou knoweſt.</q>
                  <p>Here <hi>Elihu</hi> gives <hi>Job</hi> time to reply, as he had done (at the 33d chap. verſ. 5.) as if he had ſaid, <hi>If thou knoweſt any thing againſt what I have ſpoken, or art able to make any objection againſt it, ſpeak;</hi>
                     <pb n="842" facs="tcp:104248:432"/> if thou thinkeſt I have not ſpoken right, ſhew me my errour, and ſpare not.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt;
<q>When we have declar'd what we judge to be the minde of God in any caſe, we ſhould give others liberty of ſpeaking their minds alſo.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is my opinion, ſpeak what thou canſt againſt it; we ſhould ſpeak (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24.) <hi>Not as having Dominion over the faith of others, but as helpers of their joy;</hi> The Miniſters of Chriſt muſt ſpeak as Servants to, not as Lords of the faith of others. <hi>Elihu</hi> did not carry it as a Lord over the faith of <hi>Job;</hi> but left him to make good his own opinion and practiſe if he could.</p>
                  <p>Secondly Note.</p>
                  <q>Knowledge is the fountain of Speech.</q>
                  <p>We need no other light to ſpeak by then that of reaſon, the underſtanding ſhould feed the Tongue; we muſt not ſpeak at a venture, but keep to Rule and take our ayme. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of ſome who make a great noiſe, but know not what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm (1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 1.7.) they ſpeak they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not what, and vent what they can give no account of; <hi>Speak what thou knoweſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly Note.</p>
                  <q>We ſhould ſpeak (when called) what we know.</q>
                  <p>Knowledge is a Talent, and muſt not be hid in a Napkin; if thou know better then I ſpeak, pray ſpeak, do not hide thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. As <hi>Elihu</hi> would have <hi>Job</hi> ſpeak in his own caſe, ſo he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viteth others to ſpeak about his caſe, as it followeth in the next verſe.</p>

                  <p>In this 34<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe <hi>Elihu</hi> turns his ſpeech to <hi>Job</hi>'s friends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, preſuming of, or not queſtioning their conſent to what he had ſaid, being confident that himſelf was in the right, and that they were wiſe enough to apprehend it. He was perſwaded that all wiſe men either were, or (upon hearing the matter) would be of his minde, and that therefore what <hi>Job</hi> had ſpoken, was
<pb n="843" facs="tcp:104248:432"/> very defective of wiſdome, as he concludes in the thirty-fifth verſe.</p>

                     </note> and give their judgement impartially concerning the whole matter in debate between him and <hi>Job. Let men of underſtanding tell me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>men of heart:</hi> the heart is the ſeat of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, according to Scripture language, there we read of a wiſe heart, and of an underſtanding heart; and it ſaith of a fooliſh or indiſcreete perſon, <hi>he hath no heart;</hi> he is a man without a heart. <hi>Ephraim is a ſilly dove without a heart</hi> (Hoſ: 7.11.) that is, he doth not underſtand. Mr <hi>Broughton</hi> tranſlates; <hi>Sad men of heart will ſpeake as I, and the wiſe perſon that heares me.</hi> As in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the verſe <hi>Elihu</hi> called for ſpeakers; ſo in the latter he calleth for hearers; <hi>Let men of underſtanding tell me,</hi>
                     <q>And let a wiſe man hearken to me; <hi>or as ſome render,</hi> a wiſe man will hearken to me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word rendred <hi>hearken,</hi> ſignifies more then to heare, even to ſubmit, to obey, a wiſe man will hearken to me; that is, he will aſſent to, and conſent with me, he will vote with me, and declare himſelfe to be of my mind. In that <hi>Elihu</hi> appealed to wiſe and underſtanding men.</p>
                  <p>Note, Firſt.</p>
                  <q>It is not good to ſtand to our owne Judgements altogether, in dealing with the Conſciences of others.</q>
                  <p>Let wiſe men, let men of underſtanding, heare and conſider the matter, let them ſpeake their minds; we ſhould not leane to nor rely upon our owne underſtanding in the things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne our ſelves only, much leſſe in thoſe, wherein others are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned more then our ſelves. <hi>Eyes ſee more then an eye.</hi> And though it be an argument of too much weakneſs to ſee with other mens eyes; yet it is an argument of much goodneſs and humility, to call in the helpe of other mens eyes.</p>
                  <pb n="844" facs="tcp:104248:433"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>The more wiſe men agree in any matter, the greater is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.</q>
                  <p>One man may ſpeak to Conviction, but if many ſpeak the ſame, it is a very ſtrong Conviction. Many (I confeſſe) may center and agree in a wrong Judgement; yet we ought to have a reverend e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of, and not eaſily differ from that Judgement wherein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe and underſtanding men agree. Chriſt ſpeaking of Church-proceedings and cenſures, ſaith (<hi>Math:</hi> 18.19.) <hi>If two of you</hi> (who conſtitute the leaſt number, much more if a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of godly wiſe men) <hi>ſhall agree on earth as touching any thing that they ſhall aske, it ſhall be done for them,</hi> &amp;c. So ſtill the more wiſe, holy, and learned men agree in any poynt, the greater is our conviction, and the ſtronger our obligation to ſubmit to it. He that doth not heare a ſingle brother, his fault is great; much more if he heare not two or three; moſt of all when he doth not heare the Church ſpeaking to him, and teſtifying againſt him in the name of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Elihu</hi> having made a long diſcourſe, appeal's to wiſe men.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>He that believeth he hath ſpoken truth, is not afraid to have it conſidered by thoſe who are beſt able to judge what is true.</q>
                  <p>Truth feares not any teſt, or tryall. He that offers pure gold and ſilver, cares not who toucheth it, or takes the Aſſay. <hi>Wiſdome is</hi> (ſure enough to be) <hi>juſtified of her children.</hi> They who underſtand truth, and love it, can doe nothing againſt the truth, but for it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Elihu</hi> having diſcourſed long, is willing to referre it to men, and to let them judge of it.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>He that hath ſpoken truth in his uprightneſs, hath reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he ſhall have the Conſent of the upright with him.</q>
                  <p>There is a ſameneſſe of ſpirit in all wiſe and godly men for the maine, and for the moſt part it is ſo in particulars. If a godly man conſcienciouſly judge ſuch an opinion to be truth, he may be much aſſured, that other wiſe and godly men will be of his opinion too.
<pb n="845" facs="tcp:104248:433"/> He dares ſay, as <hi>Elihu, Let wiſe men hearken unto me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, In that <hi>Elihu</hi> makes his appeal to wiſe men; to men of heart.</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>All men are not fit to give their Judgement in a caſe.</q>
                  <p>All are not Competent Judges, nor prepared to give an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if they doe 'tis not much to be regarded; wiſe men, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially godly wiſe men, men of a holy underſtanding, are the men whoſe judgement and opinion is to be regarded. <hi>Elihu</hi> having beſpoken the thoughts and opinion of wiſe men, ſeemes to give his owne in the next words.</p>

                  <p>When <hi>Elihu</hi> had offered it to the Conſideration of wiſe and underſtanding men, whether <hi>Job</hi> had ſpoken right about that great poynt, <hi>Submiſſion to the abſolute Soveraignty of God,</hi> he forbare not firſt, and plainly to declare his owne underſtanding of it.</p>
                  <q>Job hath ſpoken without knowledge.</q>
                  <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>not in knowledge,</hi> or, <hi>not knowingly;</hi> that is, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly, fooliſhly; a very high charge; <hi>Job hath ſpoken without knowledge;</hi> yet we are not to underſtand it as if <hi>Elihu</hi> thought <hi>Job</hi> an Ignorant, or an unknowing man, he could not but know other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; but as to this particular caſe, he reports him as a man that had ſpoken without knowledge, and declared himſelfe both beſide his duty, and the rule.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>They who are very wiſe and knowing in many things, yet may be out in ſome.</q>
                  <p>The beſt of men are not perfect, either in grace, or knowledge. We may know much, and yet come ſhort in what we ought to know; A man may ſpeak ſome things very underſtandingly, and yet ſpeak other things very erroneouſly; A <hi>Job</hi> may be out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. <hi>Job hath ſpoken without knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="846" facs="tcp:104248:434"/>And his words were without wiſdome.</q>
                  <p>When the Lord comes to decide this great Controverſie in the laſt Chapter of this Book, he tells <hi>Job's</hi> three friends, that their words had not been right, as the words of <hi>Job;</hi> and yet here <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>Job's words were without wiſdome,</hi> or, <hi>not in wiſdome.</hi> When God ſaid, the words of <hi>Job</hi> were right; we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, that they were ſo according to their general tenour, or they were ſo comparatively to what his friends, <hi>Eliphaz, Zophar,</hi> and <hi>Bildad</hi> had ſaid in his caſe, or at leaſt his laſt wo ds (after God had throughly convinced and humbled him) were ſo, though in many things he had fayled in ſpeech, or ſpoken thoſe things which were not right before. Yet here <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpake truth, while he ſayd, <hi>his words were without wiſdome</hi> in the ſpeciall poynt he had to doe with him about; and ſo much <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe acknowledged, <hi>I have ſpoken once, yea twice, but I will ſpeak no more;</hi> I will no more ſet my wiſdome againſt the wiſdome of God, nor preſume to have things goe according to my mind, let God doe what he will with me hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Conſider, how well this good man tooke the plain-dealing of <hi>Elihu;</hi> It might be expected that <hi>Job</hi> would quickly have riſen up in paſſion, eſpecially when he heard himſelfe thus urged; But being convinced, with what <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpake, he gave him not a word, much leſſe an angry word.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>A good man where he is faulty, will heare reproofe with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</q>
                  <p>A gracious heart, will ſoone be angry with himſelfe for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or doing amiſſe, but he can take it well to heare himſelfe reproved, when he hath indeed either ſpoken or done amiſſe. Nor are there many greater and clearer arguments of a gracious heart then this. To beare a reproofe wel is a high poynt of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. Grace may be ſhewed as eminently by our patience when we are rebuked for doing that which is evill, as by our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs and zeale in doing that which is good. When <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet applyed the parable home to <hi>David</hi> after he had not only committed but continued long impenitently in his grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſins of adultery and murder, telling him to his face, <hi>Thou art
<pb n="847" facs="tcp:104248:434"/> the man</hi> (2 Sam: 12.7.) and not only telling him ſo, but at once upbrayding him with all the former benefits and kindneſſes of God to him, &amp; threatning him with many dreadfull future judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (<hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.) when (I ſay) he was thus ſharply dealt with, it might have been feared, that this Great king would have riſen up in paſſion, and roared like a fierce Lyon upon the Prophet; yet we heare nothing from him but words of ſorrowfull confeſſion, and humble ſubmiſſion (<hi>v.</hi> 13.) <hi>I have ſinned againſt the Lord.</hi> The boldneſſe of <hi>Paul</hi> was great in blaming <hi>Peter</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and <hi>Peters</hi> meekneſſe was as great in bearing that blame (<hi>Gal:</hi> 2.14.) Nor doe I know whether the patience of <hi>Job</hi> were greater in bearing the great afflictions that God layd upon him, or in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great reproofs which this man layd upon him. I grant, he complained often of thoſe bitter reproaches which his three friends caſt upon him, charging him for a wicked man or a hypocrite, and then he replyed and replyed home: but here <hi>Elihu</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him ſharply for his raſh ſpeeches and intemperate carriage under his affliction, and he tooke it both meekly and ſilently. A good man will not ſtorme, nor rage, nor revile, nor threaten, when he is juſtly reprehended, but lyes downe under it, and takes it quietly, yea thankfully, and goes home and bleſſeth God that he hath met with a knock; Theſe are very hard words, <hi>Thou haſt ſpoken words without wiſdome;</hi> But <hi>Job</hi> ſeemes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and patiently beare them: <hi>It is beſt for us not to doe or ſpeak any thing that deſerves a reproofe: and 'tis the next beſt, to receive a reproofe well for what we have either done or ſpoken ill.</hi>

                  <p>I anſwer; The word ſignifies a two-fold tryall; Firſt, a tryall by way of examination, or argumentation; we try a man when we examine him, and argue with him, when we ſcann and ſearch out what he hath ſpoken, or what he hath done. In this ſence the word is uſed (<hi>Chap:</hi> 12.11.) and at the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe of this Chapter, <hi>the care tryeth words;</hi> that is, the eare examineth the ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe things which are ſpoken; and by the eare, he meanes not only the ſenſitive faculty taken abſtractly, but the ſenſitive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty joyned with the intellectuall. A beaſt hath an eare and can heare, but a beaſt cannot try or examine that which is ſpoken and heard; only they that have rationall faculties joyned with the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive are able to try words, and matter delivered by them. <hi>I deſire Job may be tryed to the utmoſt,</hi> that the words and ſpeeches which have paſt from him, may be fully conſidered, or conſidered to the end, that it may, at laſt, appeare what he hath aſſerted and maintained.</p>

                  <p>From the words thus opened, note firſt.</p>
                  <q>Affliction is a tryall.</q>
                  <p>It makes us appeare what we are; moſt have but an appearance till they are tryed; and being tryed, what they are doth really appeare. Afflictions try our graces what they are; and afflictions try our corruptions what they are. Afflictions draw forth the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man, they turne his inſide outward, and ſet him (as it were) in the open light. Take tryall in the ſecond ſence by way of examination, and it yeilds us the ſame truth. He that is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſifted will appeare in his own likeneſs. Let a man be fully dealt and argued with, let his ſpeeches and his actions be brought to the rule of the word, what he is, and what they are, will ſoone be ſeene. That's the tryall which the Apoſtle means (1 <hi>Theſ:</hi> 5.2.) <hi>Prove all things;</hi> prove what men ſay and hold, prove their aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and opinions, and you ſhall come to a cleare underſtanding of them.<note place="margin">Rectum eſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex ſui et obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui.</note> The rule of the word is a ſtraight or right rule, and that which is right will ſhew you both it ſelf, and that which is crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or any way ſwerving and departing from it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As tryall is taken in the former notion for affliction, <hi>My deſire is that Job may be tryed unto the end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>It is lawfull to pray or wiſh for afflictions upon others in ſome caſes.</q>
                  <p>We may pray for and wiſh afflictions upon others for their good, or for the glory of God. It is not good to wiſh evill as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill upon any man, no not upon the worſt of men. <hi>Job</hi> profeſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that (<hi>Chap:</hi> 31.29, 30.) <hi>If I have rejoyced at the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of him that hated me, or have ſuffered my mouth to ſin by wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a curſe to his ſoule, then</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſayd, If I have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or wiſhed that any evill might befall mine enemy as evill, I ſhould have done very ill, and deſerved to ſuffer ill. For that had been an evill wiſh. Yet, as we our ſelves ought to chuſe affliction
<pb n="853" facs="tcp:104248:437"/> rather then ſin; ſo we may pray for affliction upon others, rather then that they ſhould goe on in ſin. As in that caſe of the Churches proceeding to the ſentence of excommunication; which is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering of a perſon up to Satan, or a putting him into the very power of the devill for a time (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5.4, 5.) it is the end or deſigne which makes this lawfull: our buſineſs in the miniſtry and in all Church-adminiſtrations, is to put ſoules out of the power of Satan, to reſcue them out of the hand of the devill, to recover thoſe that are led Captive by him at his will; yet ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Deliver ſuch a one unto Satan,</hi> put him into the devills hands, for what end? <hi>For the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> This makes the prayer or act of the Church lawfull, becauſe the intendment is the deſtroying of that which ought to be deſtroyed, or to deſtroy that in man which will be the deſtruction of man, <hi>his fleſh,</hi> his luſt, his pride, his covetouſneſſe, his wantonneſs; <hi>For the deſtruction of this fleſh deliver him to Satan, that the Spirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Thus we may pray and wiſh for affliction upon others; but 'tis a prayer which muſt be managed with a great deale of caution, leſt our prayers to God in that kinde, be found ill wiſhes to men. That which <hi>Elihu</hi> had in his thoughts, when he deſired <hi>Job</hi> might be tryed to the very end, was, that he might be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from going on in the way wherein he was to the end. Yea, I conceive a man may pray for afflictions upon himſelfe, rather then he ſhould goe on in a courſe of ſin, or, when he findes that other wayes and means which God hath uſed with him, have not been effectuall to ſubdue his corrupt heart, to mortifie his luſts, and to bring him off from a courſe of ſin, but that (as it is ſayd in the next verſe) he is in danger of <hi>adding rebellion to his ſin.</hi> A godly man had much rather that God ſhould make him poore, ſicke, weake, and nothing in this world, then let his corruptions have dominion over him; He deſires rather God ſhould take the world quite out of his hand, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that the world ſhould get into his heart, or be as fuel to feed and enflame his luſts.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> deſired that <hi>Job</hi> might be tryed,<note place="margin">Bono ipſius op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat hoc, non o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio aut male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volentia. <hi>Druſi.</hi>
                     </note> becauſe tryalls by affliction are for our purging, refining, and bettering. Love was the roote of this wiſh, nor hatred or ill will. <hi>Let Job be tryed to the end.</hi> Why? we may take the latter part of the verſe for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why, as wel as for the matter about which he would have him tryed.</p>

We are not to underſtand theſe words of <hi>Elihu, Becauſe of his anſwers for wicked men;</hi> As if he charged <hi>Job</hi> to doe ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, or as if he had formally taken upon him to plead or advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the cauſe of wicked men; we are not (I ſay) to underſtand him ſo groſsly, nor had it been true to ſay, that <hi>Job</hi> opened his mouth, or ſpake thus for wicked men; but his meaning is, he hath ſpoken ſuch things as in common apprehenſion ſeeme to comply with the opinions of wicked men; or with the ſpeeches which they uſe when they are (like him) in a troubled condition.</p>
                  <p>Or againe, <hi>Becauſe of his anſwers for wicked men;</hi> that is, that he may acknowledge the anſwers he hath given, are not ſuch as doe become a godly man, but rather ſavour of ſuch a ſpirit as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken proud perſons hold forth in the time of their affliction; who are never pleaſed with, but alwayes complaining at divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Theſe words, <hi>Becauſe of his anſwers for wicked men,</hi> may, poſſibly, have this ſence; Becauſe he hath ſpoken ſuch things as may ſerve the turne of wicked men for anſwers, or, as if he would inſtruct them what to anſwer, when at any time they are under the hand of God. He may be ſayd to anſwer for another man, who any way prompts him how or what to anſwer. And while a good man ſpeakes amiſſe, in any caſe, he teacheth, yea and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth bad men to ſpeake ſo too. Yet I rather incline to the firſt interpretation, that <hi>Elihu</hi> would have <hi>Job</hi> tryed, becauſe his anſwers were ſuch as it might be judged he had taken wicked
<pb n="855" facs="tcp:104248:438"/> men for his patterne in giving them, and not as if in them he had given a patterne to wicked men.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> A good man may ſometimes act the part of a wicked man, or he may ſpeak like wicked men, as if he were one of them.</q>
                  <p>Though his ſtate be as different from the ſtate of wicked men, as light is from darkneſſe, or as ſweet from ſoure, or white from black, yet as to ſome actions or ſpeeches, he may beare a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to them. Good men and bad men doe, as I may ſay, enter-common in many things; a wicked man whoſe heart is nought, who is yet in an unregenerate eſtate (for I meane not by a wicked man, him only that is flagitious, a murderer, a whoremonger, a drunkard, but a wicked man is any one that is unregenerate, whoſe heart is not yet changed; Now I ſay, a wicked man) may ſpeak and doe many things like a godly man; he may heare the word, and pray, and performe outward duties, which are like and are (take them materially) the ſame which godly men performe. Thus he enter-commons with godly men; and this is the caſe of all hypocrites, who make a pretence of religion, when they have no acquaintance with the power of it. And thus through tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in ſome very burthenſome afflictions a godly man may ſpeak as a wicked man; ſuch haſty raſh provoking ſpeeches may paſſe from him as proceed from the ungodly, only here is the difference, thoſe evill ſpeeches or actions proceed from the ſtate of the one, and only from the temptation of the other.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; From the phraſe or forme of ſpeech, in which the originall expreſſeth wicked men; The words are, <hi>Men of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, or iniquity;</hi> As if it had been ſayd, the worſt of wicked men. This ſhews us what man naturally is; <hi>he is a man of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs;</hi> nothing but wickedneſs, altogether wicked. The Lord looking downe from heaven upon all the children of men (in a ſtate of nature<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>) ſayd, <hi>There is not one that doth good, no not one.</hi> Take any wicked man he hath no good in him, no not one good thought in him; he is a man of Iniquity, he is meere wickedneſs, till he be changed, till his heart be broken by Godly ſorrow, till he be united unto Chriſt by faith, and through the Spirit. I know this expreſſion is uſed ſeverall times in Scripture, to note thoſe men who are ſinners of the firſt forme, being not only ſinners in
<pb n="856" facs="tcp:104248:439"/> their ſtate, but in the higheſt degree of activity. Thus Antichriſt is called, <hi>The man of ſin</hi> (2 Theſ: 2.) And when the Prophet ſaith (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 55.7.) <hi>Let the man of iniquity turne from his evill way;</hi> he meanes the worſt of men. Yet this is a truth, every man in an unconverted eſtate <hi>is a man of iniquity;</hi> he hath no goodneſs, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God in him, he bears only the Image and impreſſe of the devill upon him. Chriſt told the Phariſees, who were high in reputation with the world for good men (<hi>John</hi> 8.44.) <hi>Ye are of your father the devill, and the luſts of your father ye will doe.</hi> The naturall man is ſo ſinfull, that he is meerly ſin. And ſometimes a godly man ſpeakes and doth as if he were ſo too. <hi>Job</hi> ſpake like men <hi>of Iniquity.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> proceedeth more fully to declare both the reaſon why he would have <hi>Job</hi> further tryed, and likewiſe what he meant by <hi>his anſwers for wicked men.</hi>

I conceive the rebellion which <hi>Elihu</hi> chargeth <hi>Job</hi> with, is not rebellion in a ſtrict but in a quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and comparative ſenſe; As if he had ſaid; <hi>Job</hi> ſinned before, but now his ſin is heightened, we ſee him now (in words) riſing up againſt God, complaining of his juſtice, or as if he had dealt unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him. What he did in the time of his proſperity, thoſe ſlips &amp; falls which he had then, weighed nothing as laid in the ballance with the intemperate ſpeeches which he hath uttered in the day of his trouble. <hi>He addeth rebellion unto his ſin.</hi> So we render as reſpecting what he was and had done before. Others render it po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially not indicatively; <hi>Let Job be tryed unto the end, becauſe of his anſwers for wicked men, for otherwiſe he may adde rebellion to his ſin;</hi> we know not whether his corruptions may carry him if ſuffered to goe onne. This is a more favourable reading of the
<pb n="857" facs="tcp:104248:439"/> text, not as a charge of naturall but feared rebellion againſt God; As if he had ſayd, <hi>I ſee the mans ſpirit is ſo entangled, that if he be not well and wiſely dealt with, poſſibly he may come to adde even rebellion unto his ſin;</hi> and whereas he ſinned before out of ignorance or imprudence, he may ſhortly ſin out of contumacy and perverſeneſs.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> There are ſins of ſeverall degrees.</q>
                  <p>Every man ſinneth, he that ſaith he hath no ſin, or doth not ſin, there is no truth in him (1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8.) But every mans ſin is not rebellion, every man doth not riſe up to that height and degree of ſinning. If any ſhall enquire, when is a mans ſin rebellion? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That mans ſin grows to be rebellion, whoſe will is much in it. He that will ſin rebells. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith (<hi>Rom:</hi> 7.19.) <hi>The evill which I would not, that I doe.</hi> This is the caſe of every godly man at his beſt, he doth thoſe evills which he would not; this is not rebellion, becauſe the will of a godly man is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and turned off from ſin; he can ſay, the evill which I would not doe, that doe I. Rebellion is the doing of that evill which we would.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In rebellion, or in rebellious acts of ſin, there is much of the underſtanding as well as of the will; that is, a man ſeeth cleerely what he doth is ſin, or that the rule is againſt him; to rebell is to ſin againſt the light. It is ſayd in the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this booke, <hi>The wicked are of them that rebell againſt the light;</hi> that is, they cannot abide the light; he means it there of the naturall light; the adulterer and the thiefe cannot indure Sun or day-light: it is much more true of myſticall light, if he hath any light of knowledge, he reſiſts and rebells againſt it. Its great rebellion to reſiſt the receiving of light offered, but 'tis greater rebellion to reſiſt light received; ſins againſt knowledge are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious ſins.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A rebellious ſin is a ſin againſt reproofe, admonition and warning; when we have been often told of ſuch a ſin, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed of ſuch an evill courſe, and yet we will goe on in it, here is rebellion; ſuch a man hath not only light in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that what he doth is ſinfull, but this light hath been
<pb n="858" facs="tcp:104248:440"/> brought home to him and wrought upon him by reproofe, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and admonition; here is ſtill greater rebellion. Therefore in the proceeding of the Church, ſpoken of (<hi>Math:</hi> 18.) when an offending brother hath been reproved and told of his fault, firſt in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ivate by a particular brother, then by two or three, then by the whole Church; if after all theſe admonitions and reproofes, he doth not repent, he is to be caſt out as a rebel, and accounted as a heathen or a publican.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, As 'tis rebellion when we ſin as againſt the reproofes of man, ſo againſt the providences of God; and thoſe of two ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When we ſin againſt the favourable providences of God, I meane thoſe which are outward; when God beſtows many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and comforts upon us, when he gives us health and riches in the world, and fullneſſe of all things, then to ſin againſt him is rebellion. (<hi>Deut:</hi> 32.15.) <hi>Jeſurun waxed fat and kicked, and rebelled againſt the Lord, and lightly regarded the rock of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> When we have received many and great mercies, then to grow vaine and wanton, and nouriſh our ſelves as in the day of ſlaughter, this is rebellion againſt God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When the providences of God have broken us by this evill or that evill, when we are broken in our eſtates, broken in our names, broken in our relations, broken with ſickneſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſickneſs, and yet perſiſt in a ſinfull way, this is rebellion, this is ſin in the very height of it. This was the rebellion of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz</hi> (2 Chron: 28.22.) <hi>Who in the time of his diſtreſſe, treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed yet more againſt the Lord.</hi> And this was the rebellion of <hi>Judah</hi> (Iſa: 1.5.) <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtrieken any more? ye will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt more and more.</hi> Take heed of this; 'tis too much that we ſin at all, let us not be found adding rebellion to our ſin. I may ſay theſe two things concerning the habit or any act of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is a burthen to a Godly man; <hi>O wretched man that I am</hi> (ſayd <hi>Paul) who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As it is a Godly mans burthen when he ſins, ſo it is his care and ſtudy not to ſin; he would not ſin at all; he watcheth himſelfe that he may not ſin in the leaſt degree. That was the Apoſtle <hi>Johns</hi> deſire and care for all the Churches (1 <hi>John.</hi> 2.1.) <hi>My little children, theſe things</hi> I <hi>write unto you, that ye ſin not.</hi> I would have you watch over your hearts and wayes ſo narrowly,
<pb n="859" facs="tcp:104248:440"/> that no ſin might ſlip you; that ye might not have a wrong thought, nor ſpeake an idle word; how much more ſhould we take heed, that we adde not rebellion to our ſin. There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of rebellion in every ſin, even in the ſins of good men; but 'tis ſad when they adde rebellion to their ſin. <hi>Samuel</hi> gives a dreadfull deſcription of that ſin which is rebellion (1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 15.23.) <hi>Rebellion is as the ſin of witch-craft, and ſtubbornneſs is as Iniquity and Idolatry.</hi> Witch-craft is that ſin wherein men have much converſe and compliance with the devill; The devill and the witch, or the devill and the Diviner (as our Margin hath it) act as loving companions; they have mutual converſe, yea com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſe, they trade together. Rebellion is that ſin, or we ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliouſly, when we declare our ſelves moſt averſe to God. The witch declares himſelfe a friend to the devill; the rebellious ſoule defieth and deſpiſeth God; now thoſe ſins that have moſt compliance with the devill, and moſt defiance againſt God, are put together; if a man doth much ſet himſelfe to oppoſe God, by ſinning againſt light, againſt reproofes, and againſt providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whether the gracious or afflicting providences of God (If a man (I ſay) rebell thus againſt God) it is like the ſin of witch-craft, which is compliance and converſe with the devill. Here is an extreame on the one ſide, and an extreame on the other ſide, yet both meete, <hi>rebellion is as the ſin of witch-craft, and ſtubbornneſs is as Iniquity and Idolatry.</hi> Theſe latter words are exegaticall; <hi>ſtubbornneſs</hi> (that is, when a man is ſtout and will goe on his way) <hi>is as Iniquity and Idolatry.</hi> We may conſider a great ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy in thoſe words; <hi>Stubbornneſs is as Idolatry.</hi> What is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry? it is worſhipping or giving honour to a falſe god, which is indeed worſhipping the devill; all Idolatry is devill-worſhip; the witch worſhippeth the devill intentionally, and ſo doth the Idolater, though he intend it not (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 10.20.) <hi>The things which the Gentiles ſacrifice, they ſacrifice to devills and not to God.</hi> I doe not ſay, every error or fayling in worſhip is devill-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but that which is Idolatry indeed, or the ſetting up of a worſhip of our owne deviſing is Idolatry, and devill-worſhip. Thus ſtubbornneſs is as Idolatry, and rebellion is as witch-craft. What is witch-craft? compliance with the devill. What is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry? devill-worſhip, a falling downe to the devill. Let the wicked conſider what they doe when they rebell; and let the
<pb n="860" facs="tcp:104248:441"/> people of God take heed of any ſin, or way of ſinning, which may be accounted rebellion. To ſin with much will againſt much light, againſt many reproofs from men, and againſt the reproving, or againſt the inviting providences of God, hath rebellion in it; <hi>He addeth rebellion to his ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Taking the words in the mildeſt ſence,</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>Sometimes a good man may goe backward, he may be worſe and worſe, and doe worſe and worſe.</q>
                  <p>We ſhould be alwayes growing in grace, that's the condition of believers and their duty, yet under ſome diſpenſations they may decline for a time and grow worſe and worſe, adding that which is like rebellion to their ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If we conſider theſe words in connection with the former; <hi>Elihu</hi> having prayed for further tryall upon <hi>Job,</hi> as fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that elſe he might adde rebellion to his ſin.</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>He that is not throughly convinced and chaſtned, may quickly grow worſe and worſe.</q>
                  <p>He may, or he will adde rebellion to his ſin. I doe not know where a mans ſin will end, if the Lord ſhould let him alone. 'Tis a mercy that any man, eſpecially that God hath a continuall inſpection over us; if ſome mens wayes were not tryed and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, they might adde rebellion to their ſin; who knows where they would ſtop? it is a mercy to have both words and actions examined by brethren and Churches, how ſadly elſe would many wander, yea it is a mercy to be tryed by affliction. When God keeps us from a foule way by building a wall againſt us, it is a mercy, elſe we might adde rebellion to ſin. No man knowes the meaſure of his owne evill heart, or what it would doe; for though believers have a generall promiſe <hi>to be kept by the power of God to ſalvation;</hi> yet how lamentably have good men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>llen, though kept from falling away? <hi>Elihu</hi> aggravates this yet further by the example of <hi>Job</hi> in the latter and laſt part of the verſe.</p>
                  <q>He clappeth his hands amongst us, and multiplieth his words againſt God.</q>
                  <pb n="861" facs="tcp:104248:441"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He clappeth his hands,</hi> or, <hi>maketh a noyſe amongst us,</hi> as Mr <hi>Broughton</hi> reads it; clapping of the hands in Scripture hath a three-fold ſignification.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It implyeth paſſion or ſorrow. A man under affliction claps or wrings his hands for griefe. Both thoſe geſtures are of the ſame ſignificancy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a clapping of the hands with indignation; when we are very angry, then we clap our hands.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a clapping of the hands for joy, or in a way of triumph; when a man thinks he has conquered and got the day, he claps his hands, and ſo doe they who are on his ſide. (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 47.1.) <hi>O clap your hands (all ye people) ſhout unto God with the voyce of triumph.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exploſurus eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet nos, ut qui viciſſet nos di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputando. <hi>Piſc:</hi>
                     </note> I conceive <hi>Elihu</hi> intends <hi>Job</hi> clapping his hands in this third ſenſe; he clappeth his hands amongſt us, or inſults over us, as if he had conquered and wonne the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and therefore <hi>Elihu</hi> prayed that he might be further try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is another aggravation of that ill frame which <hi>Elihu</hi> conceived <hi>Job</hi> to be in. And indeed to clap our hands when we have done or ſpoken evill, is worſe then the evill, which we have either done or ſpoken; <hi>He clappeth his hands;</hi>
                     <q>And multiplieth his words (<hi>or,</hi> may multiply words) againſt God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith (<hi>Pro:</hi> 10.19.) <hi>in the multitude of words there doth not want ſin;</hi> that is, there is ſtore of ſin in the multitude of words. They that will be ſpeaking much, ſlip much. <hi>Job</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth words againſt God.</hi> There is a multiplying of words againſt God two wayes; Firſt, directly; Secondly, by way of reflection or rebound; <hi>Elihu</hi> could not ſay, <hi>Job</hi> had ſpoken, nor could he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume he would ſpeak one word, much leſſe multiply words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God directly. He knew <hi>Job</hi> was a godly man, but he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts he had, or feared he might multiply words againſt God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flectively, that is, ſpeak ſuch words as might caſt diſhonour upon God, ſuch words as God might take very ill at his hands, and interpret as ſpoken againſt himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>They who ſpeake unduely of the wayes and proceedings of God with them in this world, ſpeake againſt God himſelfe.</q>
                  <pb n="862" facs="tcp:104248:442"/>
                  <p>The buſineſs of <hi>Elihu</hi> in all this diſcourſe, was to hold forth the evill frame of <hi>Jobs</hi> heart, ſignified by the intemperance of his language under the dealings of God. God had afflicted and chaſtned <hi>Job,</hi> he had multiplyed wounds upon him, and <hi>Job</hi> in the heate of his ſpirit and bitterneſs of his ſoule, making many complaints about the workings of God with him, is charged with multiplying words againſt God. We may ſpeak againſt God before we are aware; yea we may ſpeake many words againſt God when we thinke we have not ſpoke one word againſt him. While we ſpeake impatiently of the proceedings of God in the world, and murmur at his diſpenſations to our families or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, what doe we but multiply words againſt God? we ſpeake much for our ſelves to God, yea (I may ſay) we highly commend our ſelves to God when we ſubmit to his doings, and ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but in a ſilent admiration adore his dealings, and waite for a good iſſue of them. <hi>Aaron</hi> proclaimed both his humility and his faith <hi>in holding his peace,</hi> when the Lord ſlew his two ſons <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> ſtrangely with fire, for offering ſtrange fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not (<hi>Lev:</hi> 10.1, 2, 3.) But how many are there who proclaime their pride and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, by not being able to hold their peace under the afflicting hand of God, when his hand ſcarce toucheth them, or when he doth but lay the weight of his little finger upon them, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that heavy ſtroake which fell upon <hi>Aaron.</hi> We are in much danger of ſinning, when at any time we ſpeake many words, or (as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaketh) multiply words, he is a rare man that ſpeaketh many words, and but ſome amiſs, Now, if to multiply words at any time (even when we are moſt compoſed) expoſeth us to error in our words, how much more when our tongues utter many words in the bitterneſs and diſcompoſure of our ſpirits? And as to ſpeak amiſſe in any matter is to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n againſt God, ſo to ſpeak much amiſſe of our ſufferings, or of the ſevereſt providences of God towards us, is to ſpeak much, or to multiply words (though nor intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally) yet really and indeed againſt God. O then forbeare this multiplication of words, leſt you multiply ſins. Speak but little, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in the praiſe of God; take heed how you ſpeak of what God is doing to others, or doing to your ſelves. Let your words be few, and let them be weighed, for God will weigh your words; and you may heare from him in blowes, what he heareth from you
<pb n="863" facs="tcp:104248:442"/> in words. 'Tis a dangerous thing to be found ſpeaking words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God; yet this may be the caſe of a good man, whoſe heart is with God, and whoſe heart is for God: even while he hath a general bent of heart to lay himſelfe out in ſpeaking and doing for God, he through paſſion and temptation may be found ſpeaking againſt God. What we ſpeake diſcontentedly of the wayes or works of God, is a multiplying of words againſt God himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have given out and finiſhed my thoughts upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face which <hi>Elihu</hi> made to lead in his diſcourſe with <hi>Job,</hi> as alſo upon two ſtages of his diſcourſe with him. <hi>Job</hi> ſits ſilent and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers him not a word, which <hi>Elihu</hi> perceiving takes liberty to urge him further with two diſtinct diſcourſes more, contained in the three Chapters following; which, if the Lord give life and leave, may be opened and offered to the readers uſe and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in convenient ſeaſon.</p>
